97647,"p Enjoy the Rhine! No recommend? Are we a victim of google translate? :-) No idea what vivian could be meaning by this, as we have had over threehundred reactions mentioning the quality and quantity of our breakfast. Her reaction might be clouded because of her smoking marihuana inside, in spite of our warnings not to do so. Or perhaps her appetite was spoiled due to the emptying of numerous bottles with peculiar substances she brought with her. Anyway, she left us the final day of her stay without notice, so we prepared it for nothing, wich again was not very polite. Hi Liette,<br/>your points are well taken! Thanks for this feed-back, and we will try to be more clear about what is to be expected!<br/>kind regards<br/>flip Thanks for the conpliments! Now all I need is an adress to send it to....;-)<br/> thanks!"

These are standard in the historical center of Amsterdam and not considered steep by Dutch standards. For most guests they are not a problem. Also, you mentioned me being present which seemed to surprise you. There are two types of listings on Airbnb: a complete home and a room in a home . My listing clearly states it's a private room in my home. I'm sorry that wasn't clear to you. In any case, I very much enjoyed hosting you and thank you again for your stay.

Please come back again soon! Hi Shaquila, thank you for your stay and your review. I'm sorry to hear you found the steps to steep. These are normal steps here in Amsterdam, every building in the center where I live has the same type of steps.. You appeared to have a physical condition making these stairs difficult for you. Therefore, I don't believe it's fair to describe them as you did. I wish you'd asked me before booking as I've never had any feedback like this about the steps as you can read in my other reviews. Also, you mention you didn't expect me to be in the apartment for your entire stay. I'm renting a room in an apartment, this is clearly stated in the listing. You're not renting an entire apartment so I don't feel it's fair to give this kind of feedback when you shouldn't have expected the place all to yourself. Again, it would have been better for you to check with me before booking. I'm proud to be a Superhost and it's unfortunate your experience wasn't as expected. My advice to you is to reach out to the host before booking and ensure the property is suitable for you and your condition. Thank you again for your stay.

I'm very happy to hear you enjoyed the room and the terrace. Please come back again soon! Hi Lan,<br/>Thanks for your stay and your review. I'm sorry but you're incorrect, the bed is 160cm. It's very comfortable for 2 persons as per the excellent reviews I've received. I've had over 100 stays in my room and I've never had this feedback before. Regarding the pillows, when you told me during your stay you found the pillows to be hard I provided you with softer pillows immediately so I don't think it's fair that you're mentioning this in your review. Regarding the stairs, my apartment is located in the center of historic Amsterdam, there are no lifts in the buildings in the area. If stairs are an issue for you should have checked with me before booking the room. I have a 4.9 out of 5 rating on Airbnb and I'm a Superhost which I'm very proud of. I don't feel your review is a fair one. Thanks again for your stay.<br/>Best regards,<br/>Finn Thanks for your review and your stay Saida! I'm happy you enjoyed the room and the roof terrace. Come back again soon! Thanks for your review and your stay Nikolaos! I'm happy you enjoyed the room and the terrace. Come back again soon! Thanks for your review Lavinia!

Thanks for your stay Lorna! It was great having you and your cousin and I'm happy you enjoyed it. Come back again soon! Thanks for your stay Vlad! I'm happy you enjoyed it! Come back soon!  Thanks for your stay Nina and Max! I'm happy you enjoyed it! Please come back again soon! Thanks for your stay Nikita and Svetlana! I'm happy you enjoyed your stay and hope to welcome you back to Amsterdam soon!  Thanks for your stay Nik! It was great having you and Carina and I'm happy you enjoyed your stay! Come back in the summer so you can enjoy the terrace! Thanks for your stay Olivia! I'm very happy you and Connor enjoyed it. It was great having you both. Please come back again. "
98647,"Thanks for your kind words Hi Faisal,<br/>Thank you and good to hear you had a good time. I think i will make the balcony a bit nicer and put a floor in there and some chairs there. <br/>Regards,<br/>Piet-Hein"
98844,"Thank you for your review and your kind words about the location, the spacious apartment, and the service of my co-hosts! <br/>We want to emphasize that our listing clearly states that there is no full kitchen. <br/>However, we do provide a microwave, fridge, a filter coffee machine, a kettle for hot water, as well as plates, glasses, and cutlery, so basic necessities for simple meals and drinks are available. Dear Jo!<br/>Thank you for sharing your thoughts on your recent stay. We appreciate your acknowledgment of the efforts made by our team, particularly Eva and Kobe, who always strive to ensure our guests have a pleasant experience. It‚Äôs also great to hear that you enjoyed the location and found it to be a peaceful retreat, yet conveniently close to local attractions.<br/>That said, we were surprised by some of the concerns you raised, as they seem to reflect isolated incidents rather than the overall quality and experience we consistently provide to our guests.<br/>Cleaning Issues: While we take cleanliness very seriously, the issues you mentioned are unusual and out of character for our property. We have addressed these concerns with our cleaning team, and while we regret this oversight, we must emphasize that our standard practices typically prevent such occurrences. We have since conducted a thorough inspection to ensure everything meets our high standards.<br/>Floor Safety: We regret to hear about your daughter‚Äôs minor injury, though it‚Äôs important to note that this issue hadn‚Äôt been reported by previous guests. Nevertheless, we have taken immediate action to address the floor to ensure it is safe for all future guests.<br/>Cooling and Ventilation: Given the exceptional heat during your stay, we understand the need for effective ventilation. However, as soon as you brought this to our attention, we promptly provided fans to alleviate the discomfort. While air conditioning is not typically needed in our region, we are considering additional solutions for those rare hot days.<br/>TV and Blackout Blinds: The TV is indeed decorative, as clearly stated in our listing, and most of our guests appreciate the design choice. As for the attic bedrooms, the natural light is something many of our guests enjoy, but we understand this might not suit everyone‚Äôs preference. We will take your suggestion under advisement, though previous feedback hasn‚Äôt indicated this as a significant issue.<br/>Mouse Issue: We take the integrity of our property seriously and have a strict pest control regimen in place. The mouse issue you encountered is highly unusual and was addressed immediately upon your report. Our maintenance team has since sealed any potential entry points to prevent a recurrence.<br/>While we acknowledge your feedback, it‚Äôs important to consider that many of these issues could have been addressed during your stay had they been communicated sooner. We are confident that the overall quality of our property is high, as reflected in numerous positive reviews from other guests. We hope you can appreciate that some of these concerns, while valid, are not indicative of the typical experience at our property.<br/>We do hope you will consider staying with us again, where we are confident you will have the five-star experience most of our guests enjoy. Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback about your recent stay. We truly value your input as it helps us improve the experience for future guests.<br/>Firstly, we would like to address your concerns regarding the heating and furniture. We apologize for any inconvenience you experienced during your stay. Rest assured, upon receiving your report of the heating issue, we promptly addressed it and resolved it within just 10 minutes. Regarding the furniture, we take pride in offering a unique blend of antique and vintage pieces that add character to the space. While we understand that individual tastes vary, we assure you that all our furniture is carefully maintained and functional.<br/>We also want to clarify the issue regarding the kitchen. As accurately advertised, our listing does not include a kitchen or a small oven. We believe in transparency and strive to provide clear descriptions to avoid any misunderstandings. We regret any disappointment this may have caused you, but we encourage guests to thoroughly review the amenities listed before making a booking to ensure it aligns with their needs.<br/>Nevertheless, we are pleased to hear that you found the location convenient and appreciated our hospitality. We value every guest and aim to provide a comfortable and enjoyable stay for all.<br/>Thank you once again for your feedback. We hope to have the opportunity to host you again in the future and exceed your expectations."

125667,"Dear Chase,<br/>Thank you for taking the time to share your experience. I‚Äôm truly sorry for the issues you encountered during your stay‚Äîit‚Äôs disappointing to hear that we fell short of the high standards we aim to provide. Please know that we take your feedback very seriously.<br/>I‚Äôm glad we were able to resolve the situation by providing you with an alternative location and that you found our team helpful and responsive. Your comments have been shared with our cleaning and maintenance teams to ensure this does not happen again.<br/>We appreciate your understanding and hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back in the future for a seamless and enjoyable stay.<br/>Warm regards,<br/>The Amsterdam Houseboat Family Dear Deepak,<br/>Thank you for sharing your feedback. I‚Äôm sorry to hear that the space didn‚Äôt fully meet your expectations. While our goal is to provide a cozy and unique stay, we understand that space can feel limited, especially with larger luggage.<br/>Regarding the entrance, we appreciate you bringing this to our attention. We‚Äôll address the clutter immediately to ensure it‚Äôs kept clean for future guests, regardless of the circumstances.<br/>We‚Äôre committed to providing great service and a memorable experience for all our guests, and we value your feedback to help us improve. Thank you again for staying with us, and we hope to have the chance to welcome you back in the future.<br/>Warm regards,<br/>Mich√®le Dear Jo√´lle, we loved having you here. And always welcome to come back ofcourse :) Thank you Hannah! It was great to have you! Hi Daniel, Im so sorry you feel that way as we try everything to make it as unique and comfortable as possible for our guests! Your rate was actually a last minute rate so even cheaper, but guess that only makes it worse in your case ;) The shower towel we've tried but doesn't work as it will only get dirty and tossed in a corner. Again, sorry you didn't like your stay, but finding a hotel for 55eur will be basically impossible in Amsterdam. I hope you at least enjoyed the big roof terrace and feeding the ducks and all the other perks of staying on our houseboat and didn't have your trip ruined by a bathroom mat! I have put a mirror up! Hi Marion,<br/><br/>I am so sorry you feel that way! Indeed my flight was delayed which made me be late and still have to clean the room but that was unfortunately out of my control.. Hope you enjoyed your trip to amsterdam after all!<br/><br/>Kind regards,<br/>Michele Thank you for your stay! You're welcome anytime! We loved to host you! Always welcome to stay with us again :) Dear El√¥n, we loved having you! And always welcome to come back! Dear Marielle, You were very welcome! And always will be again ofcourse! Dear Rodrigo, glad to hear you enjoyed your stay! We installed a brand new bed right after you left, unfortunately you indeed had the last days on the old one which was broken by the guests before you. our sincere apologies. The studios are all entire listings as they have their own front door and bathroom and all their own amenities. But indeed it¬¥s not the entire boat, as mentioned also in the description. We would love to offer you a discount if you would like to come try the new bed ;) Dear Madeleine, we are so sorry you had a bad experience at our boat as we do our best to make sure everyone loves it! We have ordered a new bed which unfortunately didn't arrive in time for your stay :( As for the cleaning this is not our standard and we will make sure it doesn't happen again. We'd love to offer you a discount on a next stay to prove this to you! happy you enjoyed the rest of your stay! Michele I'm sorry the size of the room was not what you expected, although I do use words as ""not very spacious"" and ""small little studio"" to describe it, so people know exactly what they are booking.<br/>My apologises about the cleaning, if you would have told me when you arrived I could have talked to the cleaner and done something about it. <br/>But I hope you enjoyed your stay in Amsterdam"
126790,You‚Äôre always welcome here ü§ó Muito obrigado üòé Welcome anytime Linda and sorry about those Amsterdam stairs ;) Welcome anytime mate! You're welcome anytime :) Bonjour Jeremy. Malheureusement les souris sont dans la plupart des vieux appartements ici √† Amsterdam. Il ne faut absolument pas laisser trainer du pain hors des tiroirs. Je vais prendre note de vos commentaires et faire en sorte que les prochains invit√©s le sache. Merci encore de votre visite.

195859,Hello Carlos I would like to point out that all the info are in the advertisement so if you read it you can see the there is no use of kitchen etc Hello Raul I am wondering why you wrote that I was slow to respond when I  instead had to write you 3 messages to know what time you were arriving because you didn‚Äôt answer. What is wrong with the description of the bathroom? You can see clearly the pictures and it‚Äôs exactly like it appears
195909,"Great to hear you had a good stay. Thank you so much for taking care of the rabbits! Happy to host your stay in the future. All the best, Karina Thanks again for staying with us Kei-san.

Hopefully we will see you again next year!"
219080,"Amazing beautiful people, so happy to have them here It was a pleasure to having you here!!! Thank you so much Pierre and friends , super thank you to staying with us , great group !!!! First of all, our apartment is for a maximum of 04 people, we never accept more than 04 people as this is prohibited and there is no space or beds for 05 people, this is very clear in our profile.<br/>Second, due to Covid-19 our rate is 50% lower than the previous year, an incredibly low rate compared to the rates in Amsterdam and the high service we offer to our customers and comfort, making our guests very satisfied  , we are SUPERHOST and the almost 60 excellent comments on our profile, just check and you can confirm, we tried to do everything for Margot and friends to have a pleasant stay, even if she did not follow the proper rules of our B&B, our greeter had to waiting for almost three hours at their check in, extremely loud every morning when they return to the B&B or when leaving the B&B got the attention of the whole neighborhood, perhaps this was the first trip without their parents because they looked very spoiled girls and without much experience, and for the price she paid (about 45 euros per person per night) she expected a 5 star hotel in the center of Amsterdam she was wrong totally, just check our address on Google (12 minutes walking from Central Station) and in our profile all information about the apartment is very clear. Dear Ahmed , <br/>A pity that was not what you expected, I am not sure at what point left you disappointed, but maybe you have not read our information and etc., because we are always very clear to any detail, such as location, third floor, bathroom a floor to It is low and the owners live in the same building and we share the same entrance and stairs. Still thanks for choosing us. Thank you very much ! it was lovely to have you guys here ."
225987,"Hi Fabio, thanks for your feedback. Both rooms have black out blinds behind the curtains, I'm sorry your friend didn't see them. We will point this out to future guests. It was a pleasure to have you as our guests, glad you enjoyed your stay! Thank you so much for your kind words Brad. We really enjoyed meeting you and hosting your lovely family! Thanks so much Wendy and Ken, we loved hosting you and your girls. It's always particularly special to host a fellow superhost!"
230246,"You and your friends are always welcome! Dear Andrea had an intensive check in of 40 minutes in which tge appartment was explained and inspected. After one hour she called me about camera's. I explained to her there were not working camera's of an old security system. I told her if she didnt feel okay she could take them off or cover them. She didn't believe and left without letting me know. left lights on, doors and windows open, ate the welcome food and treats. All old not working camera's have been removed, Her  privacy was and your privacy is guaranteed!!!! With all pleasure! Thank you for your kind review. It was heaven to host you and i would love to see somewhen and somewhere in the future? XO I am sorry about the mistake of the AC, i have changed this in  the description, it won't happen again.<br/>"
231864,"Thank you for your reply Cherry, it was a pleasure hosting you and your family. Your feedback is also very valuable. We've been struggling with the heat as well as most Dutch houses weren't build for these temperatures. We're now placing ceiling fans in each room and, together with the other houses located on the square, sunscreens will be placed outside the windows. If you're ever returning to Amsterdam we would be happy for you to stay in our house again and experience the difference. Kind regards, Karin Thank you Nicolai, it was a pleasure to host you and your family. "

263233,Thank you Moritz for your 5* review; always welcome back!<br/>Small correction: our apartment is located in the Centre of Amsterdam; De Pijp starts on the other side of the water. Thanks for this great review! Thanks for this great review. CU next year!? 
263888,Clair was a very nice guest i hope you enjoyed our house!
264178,"Hi there!  Thanks for your compliments! <br/>There are two fire detectors in the staircase and there is one next to the heating kettle.  Hi there! Thanks for the compliments. You are right about the curtains. As I always get up early it doesn‚Äôt bother me, but for guests on holiday I can imagine it‚Äôs not very comfortable. Sorry about that. "
276068,"Hi Mounir, <br/>I'm sorry to hear the cleaning was not to your standard, I will check this with our cleaners, thank you for your review. About the sound of the smoke detector. The battery seemed to have emtied during your stay, if you just messaged us we could have fixed this immediately for you. We live int he same building and are always very responsive to the questions and needs of our guests. You did no need to sleep with that beeping sound all the time. I hope your time in Amsterdam was pleasant non the less and for the future please message the hosts if anything is bothering you! Thank you for staying with us! Hi Rachel, <br/>I'm sorry to hear about the lukewarm water. We had some electrical work done in our street in Oktober that made the electricity of the boiler switch off at times. We never have this problem usually, non the less this was not a nice experience for you, I understand and apologize for the inconvenience. In our listing it says we are located on the first floor, hence the staircase. I apologize for the inconvenience and that you did not realize this before booking the room. We hope you had a lovely time in Amsterdam nonetheless. Hi Kadee, <br/>Thank you for your comments, we will take care of the kitchen and its facilities better. so sorry about that. its a defect of Airbnb we cant change! Hi there, the smell of the smoke travels to all the apartments that are positioned next and around the patio area. So with all our neighbours we have decided that smoking in the area is prohibited. Otherwise we would get too many complaints. Thank you for staying with us Anette! It was a pleasure hosting you! Dear Felix, <br/><br/>We are sorry the studio was not comfortable and cozy enough for you. <br/>We have renovated the room there for certain furniture has been replaced, hence the missing couch (this is in our description) The bed is brand new and absolutely not a sofa bed. We looked into it and the guests before you broke something in the bed. That probably made the bed very uncomfortable and slumped to one side. We are very sorry about this and we where not aware of this issue during your stay. Our apologies. <br/><br/>We will post new pictures soon with an updated look so furture guest are prepared better for the new look of the studio. <br/><br/>Thank you for your stay! <br/><br/>Mirre we are working on getting the WIFI better, sorry for the inconvenience.  We are sorry your stay with us did not meet your expectations. <br/>We hope you still had a nice time in Amsterdam.<br/>There is a guidebook on our Airbnb page with info about the city and our personal favorite restaurants caf√©'s shops etc. <br/>Greetings Mirre and Anjo <br/><br/> Again sorry about the internet.<br/>Somebody looked at it and now it is fixed!<br/>"
283269,"Thank you Sarah!  I am happy to hear that you enjoyed the stay.  You are always welcome! Hi Graham, it was great having you, you were perfect guests. Yet  I would like to make a comment on your review. The  house is IN Amsterdam. Maybe it felt far from the center because you biked and took the ferry. üòÇ With the subway, that is in front of our house, you‚Äôre in the city center, Amsterdam central station, in exactly 5 minutes. I wouldn‚Äôt consider that far out.  And you could even have taken the bikes in the metro, although a bike ride to the center is also very nice. <br/><br/>Anyway, thanks for your staying with us, you‚Äôre always welcome. Manon Thank you Guendalina! We're really happy that you and you're family had a great time. You were lovely guests. :)) Thank you Adrian. You were great guests! It was a pleasure hosting you.

Hi Claire-Louise, thank you for your visit and the great review. We loved to have you and your beautiful family<br/>. Maybe we meet one day in Cambridge :) Thank you Elaine, it was very nice to have you as our guests and to meet you and your lovely daughters and beautiful grandchild. <br/> Hi Nick, thank you so much for your great review. Well appreciated :) You were very nice guests and it was great to have you. Valentino bought a nice other toy :) Hi Sang, <br/>Dankjewel voor je review; dat waarderen we zeer. Jullie waren leuke, easy going gasten. Altijd welkom. :) Hi Claire,  I'm afraid you misunderstood the information about the busses. There are many other busses going after 20.00, they depart from central station. The drive only takes a little bit more time... Thank you for the great review though! We loved having you as our guests and love to hear that you enjoyed the house as much as we do. You're always welcome!"

Dear Aurimas, i am sorry for the discomfort you had. Heater temperature drops a bit in general during night as most guests like fresh room to sleep, but this can be adjusted easily for your preference. The warm showerwater is not restricted as it runs on a seperate heater. Please next time inform me whilst you are here, as i am always available for information and help. Kind regards, RIks Thank you too and hope to host you again in future!

488009,"Hi Pablo sorry I didn‚Äôt communicate well with you . That‚Äôs not me I was probably going through a process. Thanks once more for using my place Amsterdam Zuid is one of the most expensive and most beautiful place in Amsterdam so if you rate the location 2 then you are a genius in rating üëå Hi Babak, note that my listing is cheap and moderate,  I charge 59 euros a night and nothing more , the rest money you paid almost 400 euros went to Airbnb so be careful when u describe my place as expensive. With regards to your short stay in my house, you  know you were nothing but trouble. I even tried to manage you but you decided to leave . I granted all your request except throwing your poep in the bin which I found very disgusting. Am happy you left because you are a difficult person to put up with. Good luck Great guest! Thank you Julie, I still think you guys are nice people and great to have around but I don't know what you were expecting from me. You denied eating my breakfast. You are a liar and ingrate!!! If out of 100 guests I have hosted, you are the only person that claims that I did not say goodbye after serving you cold bread, so be it Maybe you don't worth more than frozen bread!!! Good luck, I don't waste my energy on haters like you."
494281,"Anne Charlotte booked for two and stayed with three people the entire stay. I have been polite every single time we had contact and reminded them about the house rules that clearly state maximum two people per stay. Unfortunately they ignored it all. Still I helped them throughout the stay where needed regardless. Even when they returned from a bar in the middle of the night being extremely loud and clearly under the influence of alcohol, and not being able to push a 5 digit pincode followed by hashtag, i got up out of bed and made sure they got in safely. All three‚Ä¶"

Hi Mark, thanks for your lovely review, and I am so sorry for the noisy neighbours!

Again, I am sorry for this inconvenience and I would be happy to host you again in the future! Thanks Marjorie, happy to host you! Hi Michelle, thanks for your feedback! However, it states in my advertisement that I have an apartment, not a ground floor house, and almost all historical buildings in Amsterdam do not have an elevator. So yes, in all beautiful buildings in Amsterdam, a it of stair climbing is normal :). I am sorry that this has left a bad impression. <br/><br/>Also, I had all necessary instructions on my card and tell my guests they can always contact me in case of any questions. When I was at the apartment I asked you whether you had any other questions, and you said no. Always feel free to ask questions, the us of appliances are very easy to explain! Bye, Anna"
538659,"Hello Natalee. Sorry to read that you didn't had a good time at our place. You didn't make any complains during your stay. The stairs are steep, yes. That is common in a real Amsterdam house build in 1899. It is stated in the ad that the stairs are steep and there is no TV. The bed is 1.40 by 2.00m, big enough for lovers. I guess next time you feel beter booking a Hotel. Greetings Wendie Hello Justine. I'm so sorry to read that you were cold at night.

Enjoy summer, Hans & Wendie  Thanks for sharing & always welcome! Thanks for the great review! Just a quick note about the WIFI comment; last winter we have installed a 2nd very strong router (now one on each floor) to cope with the outrageous increase of WIFI-signals 24/7 in the city center. We will look into this matter and see what we can do to improve! On the other hand we have serious doubts if we want to join in on this wireless rate-race and choose for more peaceful solution!? Happy travels      Hi David & Daniella, It was great having you guys and thank you so much for the great review! Have a great summer and maybe see you again one day! Bye bye xxx Hans & Wendie "

620111,"Dear Kelsey, it is a pity that Room with a View did not meet the standard you were expecting. Indeed it is one room with one bed combined with modest facilities like nespresso, fridge, water cooker and induction plate but no kitchen sink. I try to explain as best as possible what to expect with correct pictures. I adjusted the room for your baby with a flexible baby bed and Stocke children's table chair.<br/>There is a tub with soap and dishcloths for doing the dishes in the sink in the bathroom. I will make the basin and dishcloths more visible for upcoming guests and I will explain it more precisely in my introduction for the upcoming guests.<br/>The Amsterdam spiders and how quickly they make their spiderwebs are a race not easy to win in the combined charming 17th and 19th century old house with cracks everywhere where Room With a View is based. But I try everyday and is an every day task. I am sorry I did not manage enough and I will thrive to do better. Wish you all the best and thank you for your feedback. Kind regards Minou Dear Marina, Thank you for your review. It is incredibly unfortunate that I did not give you a hospitable feeling and that the accommodation did not meet your expectations. My apologies for the miscommunication.<br/>If I do indeed explain about the lighting, the door, coffee maker and the thermostat, it is mainly to be helpful to all my guests regardless of nationality and not to be condescending. I recommend 16 C for the thermostat because that is a pleasant night temperature for many guests in this room to sleep well, but of course there may also be other preferences and everyone is free to set it warmer or colder. <br/>It is a pity that I did not see that there was still too little shower gel. I would have liked to have given you this immediately from the pantry that is in the room next to the refrigerator. I like to indicate if there is something, please let me know so that this can be resolved as soon as possible.<br/>Regarding the hair dryer. I am proud that I still have many vintage items that are still very usable. It is good that you point out to me that you prefer a new hair dryer. I will buy that, because maybe other guests will like it better. <br/>Thanks again for your feedback<br/>Kind regards<br/>Minou The dissapointment from Sophia is understandable. And I explained to her in good faith that it is a wise thing to do to have a travel insurance in general for all unexpected things that can happen in Europe when you are from the US  and that I regret her situation but unfortunately at the moment I am also responsible for my income for two persons and that I would look into what is fair for both of us. Shortly in time after I wrote that, Sophia suggested two of het young friends from Chicago were in Amsterdam and they could replace her for the two nights. I said okay and asked for a copy of their passports but there will be no discount. I informed Sophia that her friends arrived well and she gave me two thumbs üëç up and earlier in the airbnb conversation she said It‚Äôs fine no restitution. If you ever have the chance to meet this radiant couple you will know it is not an effort to be a host for them. They are friendly , relaxed and their enthusiasm is contagious. I am glad you had a good stay in Amsterdam. Hopefully we will meet again. During the check-in of Laura  and her 3 fellow students I explained her that the passport procedure is an obligation for all legal accommodations of the City of Amsterdam. It is called a night register . Shampoo is available and accessible in the only big closet of the room where she also could have found extra toilet paper , coffee, tea, towels, hairdryer if necessary. I offered her, like I do with all my guests , that she and her fellow travellers could reach me with any request or question via sms txt 24 hours and I will try to solve it. She did not ask me about it and therefore unfortunately I could not solve this easy matter. Because they were with 4 adult persons for 2 nights, they had to pay ‚Ç¨ 45,- a person a night excluding AIRBNB for their own private place in a canal house with a beautiful canal view, 2 busstops from Central Station, free coffee, tea etc. It is the best I can offer. I am glad to hear that overall it was a great stay for Laura."
669137,"Up till now, I have always been very happy with my guests. This time I returned home and found the mattress cover and sheet wrapped in the corner of the bedroom covering large blood stains. The heating was on at 25 degrees, making the house smell really dirty. As the incident had occurred on their first night, the dirty sheets have laid in the bedroom for five days. I understand that an incident can occur, but I don't understand how the handled it: why did they not contact me to ask what to do or just to let me know before I returned. How would they feel if they returned in such situation in their own home? <br/>In my understanding Airbnb is not a hotel site, guests are staying in people's homes. I offer my clean and comfortable home for my guests and do my best to support them in case of questions on where to go in Amsterdam or what to do. Luckily most guests treat my home as if it was their own: with care and respect. I guess we have different views and expectations of the concept of Airbnb. "
670266,"Thank you! You are always very welcome üòä Good to hear that you enjoyed your stay; and thanks for your good suggestions! Best wishes for 2016 to you and your family as well! We came back from holidays just after the period had ended during which we could review Marija. What I would have liked to mention is that we were happy to have Marija and her friend as guests. You took good care of the house, and left it clean; thanks!"
758308,"Hello Sarah, thank you the kind words. <br/><br/>For bedding and towels:<br/>I always make sure all the sheets, covers and towels are washed/clean.  It is the apartment I live myself, hence I use the same material. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, I appreciate you point out they would need to be renewed, I will definitely check and make sure they are suitable for the oncoming guests. Apologies if that caused any inconvenience for your stay.<br/><br/>Regards,<br/>Kutay Hello Nora, i am happy you enjoyed your stay.  About parking, you're right, maybe i should add it to the profile so people can make plans based on that.  Amsterdam is out of parking space thats why it is expensive and they try to encourage people to park a bit  more outside and let them use public transport.  Sorry to hear, it was unplanned cost for you. Take care! Cheers Jiri, good that you had a nice time. You are so kind that brought some delicious CZ beers as a present. Cheers."

871411,"Thanks for your feedback. You were very unlucky that during the stay before you the wasmachine broke down. I wasn't able to fix it in 1 day but it's replaced now and I offered you dry cleaning service  to make up for it. The warm water problem is solved as wel and so is the sink. But I'm sorry you had to experience all these 3 things in once! Thanks for your stay! Dear Inbal. We've had some troubles about you smoking weed at my balcony and the neighbours who complained about it. I don't know what you expect from an Amsterdam balcony. It's true it didn't resembles the pictures because I recently renovated it and it's way prettier now. You expected a balcony where you could smoke without bothering other people. Unfortunately that's not possible in Amsterdam since the houses are build very close to each other. You should respect the rules of the country and smoke inside a coffee shop or somewhere in nature where you are not bothering other people. Especially children... Muchas gracias Marcos! Thank you Jonna for staying and for your kind words! I'm glad you enjoyed it. Welcome back any time! Google translate:<br/>Merle was super nice, courteous and responded quickly when we had any questions. The apartment is fresh and has everything one could need , the images correspond to the way we experienced it. The area is very nice and there are both good shopping, restaurants and bars. Very hip. We will be more than happy to return!<br/><br/>Thanks guys! You were the perfect guests and are welcome back any time! Thanks Juliette! Actually there are two separate rooms. The bed is only in the same room as the dinner table. It's a small Amsterdam house :)"
907405,"Hi Jay,<br/>I am sorry your stay with us was disappointing. <br/>It is disappointing you chose to keep your feedback for the review instead of saying something during your stay, so that we can address the issues troubling you.<br/>We actually got a new bed recently, during your stay after a previous guest mentioned something about it, but did not want to disturb you by installing it during your stay. If we knew you had had problems with it we would have changed it sooner.<br/>We did have  a couple of friends over for dinner one night, and we  distinctly recall us asking you to tell us if the sound was bothering you. You didn't say a thing at the time. Shame. Most guests that stay in our guestroom find it very quiet, but of course we would have taken action had you said something. I am sorry you did not have a perfect stay. Your bed was cleaned and new clean beddings were placed before Itamar's arrival. <br/>The shower was cleaned as well before Itamar's arrival and in fact the floor has recently been  recently renovated and new tiles set.<br/>Without specific feedback there isn't much I can do to address this complaint. Most guests , including our fiends and family that stay over, enjoy sleeping on this quality futon. Hi Kirstie,<br/>We do our best to be as accurate and clear as possible in our description. <br/>It is essential to read our description in full before arrival. Nowhere in our description does it state that this room has a private bathroom.As we wrote: ""The shower/bathroom is accessible through the living room. "" Thanks Jesse,  it was a pleasure hosting you!  It is a shame Lara's visit did not go more smoothly, despite our best efforts. <br/>In all honesty she and her friend were far from the best guests we had. They came home every night quite stoned and apparently did not realize how much noise they were making right outside our bedroom when we just went to sleep. We also had an unpleasant incidence after they ordered a pizza to our place at 4am and then apparently forgot about it so the delivery guy woke us up. Just to clarify: Micky must have misunderstood since we do not have an upstairs. We live in the same apartment in our own room, we just happened to be away much of the time on the date of her visit. :) Hi Petra,<br/>We are sorry you did not have the perfect stay we would wish you to have with us. The heating system  that is placed in the closed cabinet is in fact a completely hermetically closed system and one the quietest that exist. Actually, you are the first guest in over 3 years to have complained about it (!).  However, we understand some people can be very sensitive to sound and would have tried to assist had you said something about it at the time. We do plan to have the heating moved out of the room in any case very soon. Unfortunately, there is not much we can do about the size of our shower at the moment, especially since this kind of shower is very typical for the Amsterdam, where most apartments are quite modest in size. We have tried our best to describe our listing as accurately as possible so guests know what to expect.<br/>We hope you still enjoyed your stay in Amsterdam and wish you all the best. To clarify, the price was most definitely not changed last-minute.<br/>Any discrepancy in the price at the time of Athena's booking was probably a result of the way AirBNB works; before entering specific dates and number of guests the website displays the basic (lowest) price a host charges, without any special pricing or additional fees. After entering the correct dates the website displays the final, total price. At that point you can decide not to book if the price is not right for you.<br/>As hosts, we do our best to be fair and honest with our guests in our listing's description, in our communications and in our pricing. we would never change pricing of a date that is part of an ongoing inquiry. Naturally, the rules of supply and demand dictate that not all dates have the same price, as we are part of a dynamic market.<br/>In any case the price of this specific night has not been changed for at least a month before booking. Perhaps through the rushed nature of Athena's booking she did not notice the total price before sending the reservation request.<br/> Hi Dot, Thanks for your feedback, we will take it under consideration.<br/><br/>Dot and Jon had the chance of spending the hottest weekend of the year in Amsterdam. Temperature was over day more than 30 degrees Celsius and the nights were uncommonly warm. This happens only  2-3 nights every second year or so and so a fan would only be used 2-3 nights/days a year. Additionally, you can always open the door to the garden for some fresh air. The house is on the ground floor and the back side is shaded most of the day from direct sun so stays quite cool the rest of the year. Hi Anne,<br/>It is a shame you had such a bad impression of the bikes. However,<br/>I thoroughly tested the brakes after your departure and can promise you they are working well. These bikes are not new but they are also typical for Amsterdam in that they do not have very modern braking systems. Most of the bikes in Amsterdam use similar brakes and these work better than many since I renovated them this summer myself."

922787,"Hi Zeyneb,<br/>Thanks for staying and lovely to hear that you had a great time!<br/>For the record, when you take the tram all the way to Central Station it takes 25 minutes indeed. It‚Äôs a route right through the centre with many stops.<br/>Our house is 5 minutes cycling to the Vondelpark and 10 minutes to the Leidseplein. The tram takes 15 minutes to Leidseplein, which is the city centre and close to the Nine Streets.<br/>Hope to welcome you back one day! Hi Francisco, happy to hear that everything was right. Thank you for the tip. We will do something about that. Till next time! Good to hear Mathias! Some parts of the center are 10 minutes cycling (Leidseplein), other parts (The Dam) are 20 minutes indeed.<br/>Thanks for you stay!  That's a real shame Claudia. We live in a city so you do hear noises but because of double glazing the street never bothers me. But that can vary per person of course. We found out where the smell came from; a plant that grew massively this summer was blocking a ventilator. All fixed now! You did get a good discount for 60 euro's per night. Thanks for your feedback. All the best!"
1005087,"Thank you for staying Sam! The toilet sinks indeed do not give much space for refilling anything bigger than a tall glass. However the sink and tap next to the kitchen and the tap of the bathtub both equally give plenty of space even for filling gallon size bottles. Im afraid both the house and the (steep) interior staircases have landmark protected status and both are 400 years old and typically Amsterdam. Im very sorry to find out your disappointment about the dryer. It is the trouble with a machine that is both a washer and dryer, it is not a very fast dryer unless the load is small.<br/><br/>This is why I offered to do your laundry for you on my private fast machines, it would not have been any trouble for me. <br/><br/>When you return, please do take me up on my offer, the machine is still there, however no longer offered as an amenity. –ú–Ω–µ –∂–∞–ª—å —Å–ª—ã—à–∞—Ç—å, —á—Ç–æ –≤—ã —Ä–∞–∑–æ—á–∞—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω—ã –æ—Ç—Å—É—Ç—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ–º –ø–æ–ª–Ω–æ—Ü–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –∫—É—Ö–Ω–∏.<br/>–ú—ã –ø—Ä—è–º–æ –∏ –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Ä–∞–∑ –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏–º –≤ —Ä–µ–∫–ª–∞–º–µ, —á—Ç–æ —É –Ω–∞—Å –Ω–µ—Ç –ø–æ–ª–Ω–æ—Ü–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –∫—É—Ö–Ω–∏. Thanks for your kind review, you are the first to describe the area as lively and even expressing the need for earplugs. Ill make sure I get some of those and have them available in the apartment.<br/>There is no nightlife in the area at all, and only busy during shopping hours of the nine streets. Late at night occasional persons may pass by on the extremely quiet canal, which makes their talking sound very loud, but that hardly qualifies the area as lively. But the location is in the city center not in a rural/suburbial area. Hi Edgar, <br/>The water should be hot all the time, why did you not tell me about this so I could have had a look to fix it so you could enjoy your showers better. I managed to fix the problem already, it was quite an easy fix.<br/>Wytse Im sorry about the loud music, it was a once in a life time thing, as we had a state of the art system on loan for the day. <br/><br/>I must have misunderstood you about the music, I did not realize it bothered you at all. Hope to see you again soon! And dont hesitate to come back, and take that taxi from the airport instead. <br/><br/>I hope your business here was also fruitful.<br/><br/>Wytse"
1016298,Frank and his friends are very nice and clean guests. Communication was pleasant and easy and they were very respectful to the appartement. I recommend them to other hosts as well!
1100324,"The feedback Jess gave was very usefull. Since we had just moved out of the house when she arrived, there was little time for arranging everything the apartment needed. In the time between departure and the next booking we have contracted a professional cleaner and bought more inventory. We surely hope the apartment now keeps up to the expectations of our guests!<br/>"
1107389,"Hi Alex, many thanks for the postcard and the delicious Maple Syrop. Highly appreciated and very tastefull. Die schrecklichste Erfahrung, die ich in meinem achten Jahr als (Super-) Gastgeber gemacht habe. Ich leite das B & B seit 8 Jahren und habe eine einfache Formel: ""Ich werde immer mein M√∂glichstes tun, um meine G√§ste zufriedenzustellen"". Kommentare von G√§sten nehme ich immer sehr ernst. Deshalb informiere ich G√§ste beim Check-in immer, dass sie sich bei Problemen, Kommentaren oder gar Beschwerden direkt an mich wenden m√ºssen. Ich l√∂se es lieber w√§hrend ihres Aufenthaltes als danach ein negatives Feedback. Ich habe zu 99% positives Feedback von G√§sten (auch seit vielen Jahren ein Superhost). Ich fragte Michael und Barbara zweimal w√§hrend ihres Aufenthalts, ob alles in Ordnung sei und sie versicherten mir, dass sie zufrieden seien (nach der ersten Nacht und nach der zweiten Nacht). Es ist f√ºr mich eine √úberraschung, dass sie nach 6 Tagen beim Auschecken pl√∂tzlich einen Anspruch von ihnen erhielten, das Geld f√ºr die Miete der Unterkunft zur√ºckzuzahlen, wenn es um Unannehmlichkeiten ging, die sich auf keine Sauberkeit, kalte N√§chte und keine sicheren Gef√ºhle bezogen. Obwohl ich versuche, aus dem Feedback der G√§ste √ºber m√∂gliche Verbesserungen zu lernen, erkenne ich die Probleme nicht, die sie mir gemeldet haben. Wahrscheinlich haben sie versucht, die Kosten f√ºr ihre Reise nach Amsterdam zu begrenzen.<br/>√úber keine Cleanlines: Die 153 Bewertungen, die ich bereits hatte, sind fast alle sehr positiv, fast alle auch, weil die Unterkunft sehr sauber ist.<br/>√úber kalte N√§chte: Es gibt eine Zentralheizung im Haus und eine zus√§tzliche elektrische Heizung, die G√§ste k√∂nnen ihre Temperatur selbst regeln. Nach der H√§lfte ihres Aufenthalts inspizierte ich ihr Zimmer und die Temperatur betrug ungef√§hr 28 Grad Celsius.<br/>√úber unsichere Gef√ºhle: Es handelt sich um ein elektrisches Schl√ºsselt√ºrsystem. Es verschlie√üt die T√ºr des Hauses. NEU: Ich habe auch an der Unterkunft ein elektrisches Schl√ºsselsystem installiert (ja, ich versuche zu lernen!). Sehr sicher! Aber ich f√ºhlte mich aufgrund ihres einsch√ºchternden Verhaltens unsicher.<br/>Ich bin sehr froh, dass die Behauptung von AIRBNB untersucht und zur√ºckgewiesen wurde. One comment: The accommodation is not located in the red light district! The red light district is one block further. For the rest, many thanks for your positive feedback and I hope to host you again in the future. Thanks for the feedback. One small correction: The guesthouse is NOT located in the red light district. The red light district is about 0.5 km away.  Suzanne, Thanks for staying at my guesthouse BBtheDam Hi Marie, Thanks for your feedback. Very useful. However, the entry door with private code works normal. Maybe I had to explain it more clear to you. In all cases it is not ok to let the front door wide open the whole evening in the center of  Amsterdam like you did. It is a lucky I discovered it in time before thief's were able to pick everything from your stuff and my private house. Kind regards, your host Henry Thanks for your feedback. In general all feedback is positive about how clean the guesthouse is (including bathroom and bed / bedroom). I'm sorry to read that you was not that positive about the hot tub and the mosquitos. It should have been mosquitos because it was exceptional warm with combination of light in the room and open windows. No other complaints from guests before and after your stay about bites. But anyway, thanks for your recommendation. Henry Thanks for your feedback! I did not know that the TV was not working. For all new guests, please give me feedback during stay and I can do something to make your stay as pleasant as possible (e.g. reparing TV, it was just one connection what was not ok). Kind regards, Henry"
1125467,Gracias Maria! Thanks man! üëç
1141485,"Thanks for your compliments !!PLEASE READ OUR REACTION TO ANDREW!!<br/><br/>First of all, let me state that bed bugs are not only for any vacationer the ultimate horrorshow, but also for any hotelier or B&B host. <br/><br/>When you discover bed bugs, you don‚Äôt start guessing as to who may have brought them along, you start acting as soon as possible, which is what we did once we were notified of the issue.<br/>Unfortunately, this wasn't until the next guests (who had arrived on the day Andrew and his party had left) wrote us an e-mail late that night, which I read at 05:00 the next morning. <br/><br/>When they woke up, another B&B room for the couple sleeping in the room upstairs had already been arranged, at our cost of course, and at 11:00 that morning all of their clothes had been cleaned. We also had a pest control company clean the room within 24 hours.<br/><br/>As you can read in the review after the one by Andrew, by Dayana, these guests did not reproach us for this unpleasant situation, but instead praised us for our fast acting:<br/><br/>‚ÄúGis√®le and Simon's apartment was lovely. When we had an issue, they got back to us immediately and clearly wanted us to have a good experience. They were quick with their responses, proactive, helpful with their tips for experiencing the city, and very hospitable. We hope to come back to Amsterdam and to stay at their apartment again in the future!‚Äù<br/><br/>We tell all of our guests our mobile phone is always on, day and night, and in case they need us, get lost in the city, need a doctor, etc., they should call us immediately. <br/>Andrew did not call us at all during his stay, which meant that we obviously could not come to his aid. What's worse, because he didn't call us, the next guests were also unnecessarily exposed to the bed bugs.<br/><br/>It was only after I e-mailed Andrew to tell him that he and his friends should have all of their clothes cleaned because Dayana and her friends had discovered bed bugs, that Andrew came with a reaction.<br/><br/>Next in his review is an insult to us and Wilma, our professional cleaning woman, that our apartment is full of filth. As I stated earlier: bed bugs are brought along by vacationers, never on purpose, this risk is simply a highly unfortunate consequence of modern global tourism. As hosts, the only way for us to mitigate this factor is to react adequately once we become aware of the issue, which we believe we have done.<br/><br/>Lastly, a comment about the rules we maintain for our neighbours. These are just to respect them after 11:00 in the evening and when going up and down the stairs. We prefer to rent our apartment out to families and elderly couples because we have had issues with people not respecting these rules in the past. When Andrew made his booking request, we had an exchange by e-mail first, in which I explained this to him and advised him that he should maybe look for another apartment. However, he insisted he wished to stay at ours, and thus we finally accepted his booking. So there is no reason to complain about our house rules. See the rest of our reviews and you will read that all of our guests have had a good time when staying with us. Thanks for your review. Are you still traveling or back home again? Hope when you are/ get back home you will have the feeling your holidays have been a relief from the tension of daily life and has given you the energy and the strength  for living the coming year with trust<br/>You are allways welcome again<br/>Gisele and Simon  Thanks for the compliments. Michaela. If you want to stay in the centre of amsterdam, all houses have steep staircases. Ours is even moderate compared to other ones. And nonen of these houses have elevators. As you could have seen while in amsterdam, all houses in the centre have hooks just below the roof. Because our stairways are narrow as well, we move our furniture by hoisting!!!!"

I would not disappoint you. You were in good hands by my daughter and neighbour. I am glad you enjoyed!  Always welcome, Winnie! Ha Ankie, dank voor de tips!  Thank you for your fine review, Fabio. A short reaction about the safety in the neighborhood. I live for almost 30 years in this part of Amsterdam and it is very safe. As a woman alone I can walk over the streets and in the park at night. No problem at all. In the years the Netherlands and Amsterdam especially becomes more multicultural. We take care and have opportunities for a good life here. It makes Amsterdam a melt pot of cultures which brings a lot of life too. I am very happy living in Amsterdam South East. Immer wilkommen, Elke, es hat mir auch sehr gefreut. Bis n√§chstes Jahr! Andrea See you in future, than, Celine! That will be nice. All the best! Aur√©lien, you managed your English perfectly! We do understood each other and that is the main issue. All the best! Thanks, Olga! All the best. Graag gedaan, Steve! Thank you for the tips. I really appreciate! Laeti et Marie, merci! Merci pour le tuyau. Je vais y r√©fl√©chir.

It was great meeting you to! See you hopefully once in Pampatar. All the best! Dank je voor je recensie en advies, Jolien! Het was leuk jou en Fran hier te hebben. Vandaag is hier een fotograaf van Airbnb geweest en ik ga ervan uit dat daarmee  de presentatie beter zal zijn. Het zou leuk zijn jullie hier vaker te zien! Het allerbeste aan jullie beiden!

I really enjoyed meeting with you, Sergey and Oxana. <br/>All the best, Stephan Ma√Ælys, Thank you very much for your kind review! I am happy the apartment helped to make your Christmas in Amsterdam a warm experience. Ciao Andrea, I am very happy you enjoyed your time in Amsterdam and the apartment! The sofa and the soft carpet are great spots to sit, smoke a joint and simply watch the world... And the good thing is, there is no need to leave the house, because the world comes in through the windows; even when it rains.<br/>It really would have been nice to be able to talk more with you. But maybe I will need to learn Italian... :) Where in Italy do you live?<br/>Ciao, S. Thanks a lot for the very nice review, Erin! I am glad you guys had such a good time. S."

1346106,"It is a shame Leo does not mention the reasons he was removed from our home. Leo booked for 3p. Yet partyed with 8p in our home of which at least 5p stayed overnight. This is ILLEGAL in Amsterdam - as clearly explained to Leo. After several warnings from our side (even prior to arrival!)  and many broken promises and lies from Leo's side, Leo left us no other option but to choose for our own safety and legal status."

1400952,"Dear Saj,<br/>I‚Äôm really sorry you have had this experience with noise disturbance from the neighboring renovation.<br/>I had specifically agreed with the contractor to refrain from any drilling etc. during your stay and really wished you would have told me during your stay so that I could have stopped this.<br/>I can assure you that I didn‚Äôt put the listing up because of the renovations. The house was put on Airbnb because I was travelling overseas, something I regularly do as you can tell by the many, exclusively 5 star reviews for the listing and my Super Host status.<br/>Next time you are travelling to Amsterdam I would be delighted if you would stay at the house again, this time fully complementary.<br/>Best,<br/>Emilie"
1406783,"Bernadette found a washed out stain on a blanket under the bedding that was not exposed. I am sorry about this, furniture, bedding, and matresses get replaced, but sometimes there are traces. Sheets are always 100% clean and if not I will replace them immediately. the silverware is in a drawer that Ankit did not see. We communicated about it afterwards. thank you Cornelia! Great to host you. Please not (also for future guests) that there are a few pictures of the new couches and the new paintings. Most interior elements are still the same. Dear Anne,<br/>Thanks for your review. There is a basket full of soap and shampoos next to the bath left for guests.<br/>The prices vary per season: winter is much cheaper and summer, starting in April, is high season. Hence, the difference in price. You do have a choice: we have plenty of requests for bookings, so you did not have to choose this flat.<br/>The furniture does change: I have bought a new couch and sometimes I buy new paintings as well. It is not less fresh, it is slightly different. Some people think it is a big improvement. At least everything is new now. Thanks Tate, hope to see you next time!"

1451657,"Thank you for your feedback. I greatly appreciate it and we are happy you enjoyed the quiet area of the apartment and our friendliness. Thank you for the time to give us suggestions so we know what to prioritize.<br/>Thank you for staying in our apartment and we hope to welcome you back in the future. For group sizes of 5+ you can have your headquarter in my apartment, four persons are allowed to sleep in this headquarter, depending on group size , other group members can be lodged in one nearby apartment. Thank you for your feedback. I greatly appreciate it and we are happy you enjoyed the wonderful location & quiet neighborhood of the apartment.<br/>I am sorry, our care of your family and the apartment felt for you like an invasion of your privacy.<br/>We mutually agreed that the apartment would also be cleaned for free during your stay. The cleaning lady needs 4 hours to clean and change linnen, because the apartment is quite spacious.<br/>I am sorry I upset you, by taking photos of the locations in the apartment to show you the best place for dirty linnen and the keys. Only a text message would have been sufficient.<br/>We will inspect the carpet on the stairs and the kitchen floor and clean or replace it.<br/>Thank you again for your honest opinion and we hope to welcome you back again next year. We have fans now. I am sorry to hear that you were not completely satisfied.<br/>Your stay was during the IBC Congress in RAI. By far the busiest (and most expensive) week for hotels and apartments in Amsterdam. Thank you for appreciating my apartment. The guests before you smoked a lot. We washed the curtains."

Thanks Alice! Merci Coline! We are shocked by such a negative review. We tried to stay supportive and transparent, happily receiving large post packages for Jim prior to his arrival as well as asking Jim multiple times during his stay if everything was up to his expectations.<br/>It‚Äôs a pity Jim kept his harsh critic up till the end of his stay, even before check-out he wrote to us ‚ÄúFound everything fine, having a great time!‚Äù<br/>We totally accept you don‚Äôt have to be happy with our place, yet participating in Airbnb community is about being transparent and supportive. <br/>We wish you more satisfaction with your future trips as well as we advice you to be more honest when a host asks for feedback.<br/>PS. We received 69‚Ç¨ a night during Jim‚Äôs stay. Good luck with finding a 3-star hotel in Amsterdam center in the end of April for that price. Thank you Zoe, the pleasure was ours!

Merci Roger et Laurence,  c'etait vraiment un plaisir vous accueillir. Merci bien Marie-Chantal! √† la prochaine! Thanks Sukesh, we would love to host you again! Dear Khaled, <br/><br/>We are rather shocked to read your extensive negative review. <br/><br/>First of all, we rented out studio to you and your wife and did not expect that your son would be ringing our bell at midnight several times. <br/>Second, we didn't foresee you would manage in such a short time to get in conflict with our neighbours by parking your bike intrusively in front of their door. <br/>Third, we hope you realise we were 100% at your service with your countless requests, like when you asked us to take care of your son's bike or did not like the color of your towels.<br/><br/>Based on the amount of your reviews and a ""hotel mentality"" you have shown, we wonder if Airbnb is the right community to fulfill your expectations. Our Park Suite is located in a monumental building and the specific character is integral part of Amsterdam experience. We would have appreciated if you would have expressed your needs clearer, as we did ask you to let us know when we could pass by to refresh the room several times.<br/><br/>Good luck! The disappointment was mutual unfortunately.  Gracias Mauro Thank you Tony! You're welcome to stay with us whenever you want! Thanks a lot! Thank you so much George! Thank you Ashley! Danke Johanna! Merci bien Alice! Thanks Orsi, you are always welcome at our place! Thank you Sandy & Larry, please come back whenever you feel like visiting Amsterdam again! Thank you guys for staying with us!

All the best and happy holidays Hi Olivier, as you can see in our place description no kitchen is mention.  So there is no reason for you to complain that there is no kitchen. You got exactly what we we mentioned: coffee machine and refrigerator.  <br/>Your complain about privacy is ridicules, specialty after I asked you to low your music after complains from our neighbors about the noise you made with your music. <br/>Again, as written in our place rules, no parties. Thanks Jennifer for your message!! dear Dana, than you for your kind words! They are important for me. I hope to host you both again here! all the best, Ronit Many thanks for your words!

1512673,"Hi Tyson. Our listing says clearly that there is no airconditioning. I can understand your disappointment but to give my listing a low review because you can‚Äôt read isn‚Äôt really fair. Thank you so much! :) I am not really agreeing with your review. You say it's tiny but perfect for 2 people. It is meant for 2 people so I don't really understand the added value of this comment. Besides that I dont know what you are used to when you book a hotelroom but this room is 25m2/269ft2 (with a 13m2/140ft2 private terrace. A hotelroom in Amsterdam is mostly 2 or even 3 times smaller than this. And also packing light is a bit overdone as it's only one stairs (13 steps). And if we are home we even carry the luggage upstairs, and i'm even pregnant! Thank you so much for your sweet review! Means a lot to us. Kind regards Lenny Hi Alina. I thought you would be write this down. In our houserules (which you agreed to!) is written down that you can‚Äôt bring unregistered guests with you. You did this anyway. <br/>I have never accused you of doing drugs. I only pointed you to the rules because you wasn‚Äôt respecting them. <br/>Besides that you asked me in the middle of the night if you could check out later. I told you, 11.30 was possible but not later because of the cleaning schedule.<br/>You did not listen and wasn‚Äôt ready at 12.00. Which is extremely disrespectfull.<br/>And yes. That made me stressed.<br/>And you are right, we are not a place for young people not listening to the houserules and not respecting the checkout time.<br/>Kind regards, Lenny you almost make me cry! thank you for your kind words. i want to come to istanbul just for you! i might do that!!!!

Best, w And vice versa ! Next time ! Thanks, it was really nice having you !!! Hi Diane, You came in 3 hours earlier so I had to sent someone else... Right then, you (or your husband) told me per text to 'take it easy'.  It is not strange things were chaotic since you came in on a different time...<br/>And on the table you could have find a house manual with local suggestions, or you could have asked. <br/>I'm sorry Diana, but I find it a bit rude to complain here while you never mentioned anything to me or Edith and expect us to show up a few hours earlier. <br/><br/>But  hey, communication is not our best skill or is it ?"

1600010,"Hi Alicia, it's great to hear that you appreciate our efforts and that you had a pleasant time in our studio. All the attractions are indeed a stone's throw away. It's great to hear that you also got the most out of your trip to Amsterdam. What a wonderful recommendation. We blush. ;) Thanks for coming to Amsterdam. What kind words. You were an excellent guest. Dear Shawn, <br/>I blush. It was clear from the first moment that you both enjoyed the city very much. And that you used every second optimally. It was also immediately clear that you appreciated our studio. Just like our suggestions and support. But that you would write such a rave review, that surprises us very much. Thank you for this and maybe until next time. You are both very welcome again.<br/>Anke, Robert and Jim. And you were great guests. Thank you for enjoying Amsterdam so much. We blozen ervan. Zeker, we doen erg graag ons best om het onze gasten maximaal naar het zin te maken. Het is elke keer weer een beetje spannend omdat iedereen andere verwachtingen kan hebben. We zijn heel blij dat het dit keer weer zo goed gelukt is. Dank je wel voor de lovende woorden. Pam, we are happy to hear you enjoyed (Cr)adam restaurant so much. Please come again. Thank you Robert for your kind words. We would love to welcome you again. Jen, dank je wel voor je uitgebreide reactie. Fijn dat jullie het zo naar het zin hadden. Bij ons en in Amsterdam. Thank you. Glad you enjoyed Amsterdam and appreciated our studio so much. Dank je wel Dwayne voor je vriendelijke en lovende woorden. Vooral fijn dat je zo van Amsterdam hebt genoten. En inderdaad, alles is zo dichtbij dat je vrijwel overal heel gemakkelijk kunt komen. Groeten van iedereen uit de Jordaan. ;) Kevin, It was very pleasant to receive you as a guest. You are most welcome next time. Thank you, John. My pleasure. Dank je wel Andre. Fijn dat je onze gast was. Serhat, you are a real 'Amsterdammer'. The ease with which you were cycling was impressive. Thank you for enjoying Amsterdam to the max. Please come again. That is the true-airbnb experience... Thank you! And thank you for staying with us. It was an honour and pleasure having you and your young family staying with us. Dank je wel, Maryna. Dank je wel Kalitha voor je enthousiasme. Graag gedaan. Alan, wat een sympathieke woorden. Daar worden we extra blij van. Thank you Andrew, for your XXXL-review. And all the kind words. It was a pleasure hosting you and it was a pleasure helping you to enjoy Amsterdam to the max. Julie, dank je wel voor je mooie woorden. En informatie voor volgende gasten. Stijlvol en comfortabel... wat een sympathieke beoordeling. Thank you Hayley Lilley, we are happy you appreciated it all.

Another sunset coming up... Thank you Naomi for your kind words. PS You stayed with us during the first heat wave of 2015. We enjoyed to make you feel at home. Unfortunately we can not yet controll the weather ;) Muito obrigada Patricia. please come again. Thank you so much, thank you for leaving the place so tidy. And yes, everybody should book tickets ahead online. Amsterdam is invaded by people from abroad. They love our city! And we love them!  Thank you Noam. You were great guests. Dear Marshal Mawson, <br/><br/>So far we have 43 reviews of people that are very very enthusiastic about our place. Therefore we have a *****star rating which makes us very happy. We enjoy to make sure our guests have a wonderful time. We regret to understand you are the first one to say you did not find the place amazing, because everybody else did. <br/><br/>Yes, there are items stacked because this is our house, we are not a hotel. We regret you did not read the information. It says: ""living room & bedroom in one space"", but we will gladly use your word 'studio' in the future - thank you. Regarding your remark on the floor, wall and towels we choose not to respond. It is just ridiculous. <br/><br/>But the main question is: why did you not mention these issues while you were here in Amsterdam. We told you to contact us in case there was anything not to your expectations or standards. Then we would have found a solution. Now we have to deal with your grim, unfair review that really hit us in the heart since we are so committed to hosting great guest.<br/><br/>Anke & Robert merci ;) #blush muito obrigado Thank you very much - happy the both of you enjoyed it so much. thank you.   #blush<br/> Thank you for your kind words. See you again. Thank you for your kind words and the fact you enjoyed the place so much. It is good to hear we live in the nicest place of Amsterdam ;)<br/><br/> So happy you came for Kingsday and not for Queensday. Because one week later many tourists came for Queensday. Some were dressed up in orange clothings looking for the big party that was not there..... It looked funny... but they were very disappointed.<br/>Moral: allways check your data! You did! It was great having you stay in our appartment. And indeed the place is increadibly central. Sometimes we forget ourselves and do take our bicycles... <br/>Hope to see you again. Thank you Griffin for your kind words - it was a pleasure to make you feel a home. thank you - great having you at our place #blush<br/> Thank you for your kind words. We love to welcome you again in our sunny little gem...    You were great guests and great cyclists! Amsterdam hopes to welcome you again soon. En jullie waren ook 'einfach perfect'. Zo fijn dat jullie je zo goed vermaakt hebben. And thank you for enjoying the cycling. Gerne auf Wiedersehen and thank you for leaving the place so clean and tidy. Muchas gracias! We are happy you both enjoyed Amsterdam and cycling so much. See you agian. It was great having you stay in our appartment. We are happy you enjoyed it so much. And thank you for leaving the place so neat and tidy. –±–æ–ª—å—à–æ–µ —Å–ø–∞—Å–∏–±–æ - thank you very much.

1657181,"Hi Edigio, thanks for your feedback. It‚Äôs mentioned at the accomodation part that there is an animal in the house. Sorry you did not read this part. But good feedback I will mention it extra in the main text. HI Ting, Thanks for your feedback. Don't get your comments on the bed in the main bedroom as it's an auping bed with new mattresses so no pull-out couch at all. Maybe you're confused with another air bnb you visited. In regards to the guestroom with the door for coco, this indeed something I can't change but no other guests comment on it before. But will mention in the overview, so guests are aware of this. Although this I hope you had a great time. Thanks Anne, I understand your comments on the hair of Coco. It's unfortunately the shedding period this time of the year so really hard to keep under control during this period. Sorry for this, but great to hear you had a great stay anyway!"

Hi Clara, thanks for your review. So sorry to hear about spiders in the garden. This time of the year there are many. We noticed a tampon in the pump of the toilet although we asked you to be careful and only to use toiletpaper. (We didn‚Äôt charge anything for the costs) Please take care of these houserules! DearDavid, Thank you for your nice review! We will fix a strip against the draught. Thanks! Ester Dear Taylor, We noticed that the pomp didn't worked well (that's why you heard the noise) so we replaced it. I'm sorry for the inconvenience!"

We will adjust our desciption at some points... :-) We always advise tram nr 17 instead of 11 because the tramride itself is shorter and overall less crowded. With heavy luggage travelling through Amsterdam is indeed not a good idea, best to take an Uber next time!

1759884,"It was a pleasure having you guys. Thank you for taking the time to write a review. You were kind and respectful . Thank you very much Celine, you were great guest,  kind and considered. Dear Susanne, Please note that airbnb already confirm that we sent you a mail explaining you  that we will come with a responsible from that fire department. This woman was not making pictures of your belonging but from the fire exits  lights and the alarms. I understand that you are on holiday and that probably did not check the mails. But for safety reasons we can't ignore the dates of maintenance.   We did not entered without knocking and you gave us the ok to enter. Dear Eric,<br/>We had provided the footages to the police.<br/>We had the appointments to do the crime report after you left.<br/>What the hell are you implying?<br/>This is the worst that you could  have written. There were 3 apartments busy only 2 were broke in. <br/>Those doors are impossible to get in if they are locked.<br/>So probably they<br/>We‚Äôre not.<br/>We changed all the locks contacted you right away <br/>Gave you new keys. <br/>Change the main door with a new safer system.<br/>What happens to your father is horrible and I really thought that we paid attention to your needs.<br/>When you left you thanked me .<br/>Although we feel very responsible for everything that happens in our apartments, we can‚Äôt manage the city crime.<br/>We were surprised as you were.<br/>I am so sorry about your father . You could have been honest and speak up to me if you were unhappy, you called the host at 2.00 oc clock in the morning while the host was sleeping <br/>you were leaving at 9:00 o clock . when I was in the morniong the wi-fi was working perfectly <br/> Thank you it was great to have you The bathroom is tired and  even when is not dirty it doesn't look its best . We will renovate it at the beginning of next month. We were waiting for a gap to be able to to work. Again we apologize that you did not have the best time in our property. Thank you for the feedback. We are very sorry that you feel this way. Again as I mentioned Earlier wish that you called me while you were in the apartment. We are aware that the bathroom is very tired and we are planning a renovation at the beginning of November. Thanks for calling our attention. We did change the title of the property. One  day was recently renovated. we wish to have you back! Thank you for the lovely comments"

Hope to see you again some day!"
1817922,"Hi Marion, Thanks for the kind words and the nice review. Prices in Amsterdam for buying, renting and short stay are incredible high due to the high demand. My price are honestly below average, and that is why I think my apartment is highly requested. It is also very well located, being in the center of the city, but not in the middle of the crowded and touristic areas, which makes it ideal. <br/>On top of that Airbnb keeps approx 30% of your booking costs...Hosts make 70 euros or less every 100 EUR booking.<br/>That said, I am glad you had a nice stay, and I hope to have you back again. Hey alex! Thanks for the review. We forgot to leave out the eye masks and ear plugs. We won't forget next time for the guests and appreciate the reminder. Thank you Jiawen! We will make sure that it is spotless like our other reviews ;) There have never been any complaints about the security of our apartment and while our guests have stayed, we have never been informed about any losses. Our apartment is thoroughly cleaned before new guests. For a clearer picture of this strange situation, please look at the reviews we have left for previous guests. Respectfully and sincerely yours, Olly and Josh."
1849988,"Dear ajeev,<br/>Thank you for your honest review, but let me explain a thing about the toilet paper issue which you find the most annoying.<br/>The apartment is situated in a basement means you are below canal-sea and sewer level. Means every water goes up with a ""sanibroyur"" Is a pump. Normally a pump lives 2/5 years, we had to repair or buy a new one every 5-7 months. Why? Dear guests put sanitary tissues, to much toilet paper, joints or even food through the toilet. The pump can not handle that. This is why we have followed the Spain-Portuguese-Italian -Turkish-Greek way to put toilet paper in de the dustbin next to the toilet. <br/>Hope I could explain it better now and you understand why we had to instal this rule.<br/>Thank you and greetings,<br/>Nicolette  Dear Kieran,<br/><br/>Thanx for your input, great idea the map I am going to buy or make one!!<br/>No shower leaks...the shower is working etter than the drainage...it is a basement problem, we have looked at this problem several times already with the plumber but have not found a great solution yet.<br/><br/>kr nicolette Hai Kimba,<br/><br/>I lost your email connection through airbnb, so I contact you like this. <br/>Hope you received the Ipad well! The costs were bit expensive I think (94.13 euro), but the most important is you have it back!<br/><br/>kr Nicolette Chi-Ping and her friend were lovely guests, so sad i have not met them in person. Communication went Well! Thanx for your support and comments! Dears,<br/><br/>Thank you for your feed back, I am sorry I stressed you on your holiday. I make sure I will check my mail more often on day of arrival.<br/><br/>kr Nicolette Thanx for the review, good to hear your daughter felt at home!<br/>Did you find the magnificent fries?

I am glad that you liked the room, the location and the detailed description that I wrote on my listing.<br/>I‚Äôd like to thank you for your suggestions for things you think can be improved. However I am disappointed by your comment that you didn‚Äôt feel safe at my house. I have been hosting for Airbnb for more than four years with over 430 reviews and they are mostly positive. In regard to the incident with the toilet, my apology for the inconvenience that you had to share the bathroom with us for a day.  I admit I was not very happy woken at one o‚Äôclock in the morning to deal with an urgent problem.I managed to get the toilet fixed the very next day. Regarding the ‚Äòparty‚Äô, I had told you that it was a going away dinner for my son when I invited you earlier in the day to join us. I was surprised that you left as you did without saying anything. That said, I would be happy to give a discount for you to stay with us on your next visit to Amsterdam. <br/><br/>I hope you have a good trip back home.<br/>All the best <br/><br/> Hello Katia, I am suprised that you had all this issues, why didn't you raise this with me while you were here? We sat together and had enjoyable conversations on several ocassions and you never mentioned any of this to me. <br/>I am sorry that you felt that way and my apologies for forgetting to brig the tea, it was a hectic day.<br/> I hope you had good trip back home.<br/>All the bes,<br/>Rosie<br/><br/> Thanks for the good review! Good luck on your new job.<br/>Rosie Thanks June for the nice review!<br/>Rosie Thanks Ignacio for the lovely review. <br/>It was nice meeting you.<br/>Come back anytime you like!<br/>Rosie Thanks Ashley for lovely review!

Hello Jenny, I m glad to know that you liked the location the room and the cleanliness of the house and felt that the photos on my website are accurate. I was surprised however that you were not happy with a few things and did not tell me when you're  here. I am very open with check in and check out times if we arrange them in advance.  I welcomed you and handed the keys when you arrived and  only asked you to wait for the cleaner to finish the room. It was your decision not to wait but to leave and come back later. <br/>In relation to the house rules - I am sorry that you were not happy to see them in writing in the room. I leave written copies in the room because some of my guests don't read all the information on my listing.  <br/>Rosie Romy, thanks for the great review!

Also very happy to know  that you enjoyed the gift that I gave to you to take home.  <br/>However, I am surprised that you mentioned in your message that you needed to ask for a hair drier and extra pillows as I had promptly provided them to you when you asked. Nonetheless, thank-you for pointing out that this was an issue for you. From here on in I plan to leave a hair dryer and extra pillows in the room for guests. <br/><br/>I am happy to know that you liked the breakfast and thought it was very tasty.  I am sorry that you did not like the breakfast schedule but I can't leave breakfast open all morning as you can understand.<br/><br/>I hope you have a success on your new life in UK.

I tried to reach you by email and sms to let you know about my schedule and explain the best way to get to my place from the airport but I guess you never read it.<br/> This is a B&B and is not a hotel where you walk in and check in any time you like. I am sorry but we do not have a 24 hour reception desk. It is important to understand the concept and the philosophy behind the B&B, and communication is an essential factor in this line of work.<br/> I do my best in order to accommodate my quest's needs and make them happy. That is important to me. <br/>Rosie Thank you Susan for the great review I appreciate it. <br/>It was very nice meeting and talking to you to.

I hope you are happy and everything went well with your house renovation project. Dear Jennifer, <br/>I‚Äôm glad you found the neighborhood to be nice, quiet and safe but disappointed that you were not satisfied with certain house rules. I enjoyed the long conversations we had in the mornings and am surprised you didn't mention this while you were here. As my listing indicates, my apartment is in a quiet neighborhood and I serve a continental breakfast - usually at 9am but I‚Äôm flexible for anytime between 8am and 10am if my guests ask. As for the stairs, most apartments in Amsterdam do not have elevators, only stairs. Best of luck in your travels. Kind regards,Rosie Hey Lev, thanks for the great review!<br/>   <br/> Judith thanks for the great review! I really appreciate it. Also thanks for the tips.<br/>Rosie Thanks Vitaly for let me know, I will do that.  It is so quiet here than you can hear the sound of closing door. Thanks Shannon, for a great review! I appreciate it.<br/>Rosie Thank you Manuela!<br/><br/> Thanks Nick! I appreciate your comment.<br/>Rose"

2194347,"This review is unfair and inaccurate. All the details of the apartment are available on the website. The skylight is convex, and there are no windows providing a view of it. Please have a look at the website and other reviews for accurate information about the apartment. Hi Jules, thanks so much for your thoughtful suggestions, a rug on the bed floor is a great idea, I will try to make it happened. I‚Äôm sorry about the running water sound. When are trying to solve the problem in the past, but the house is too old, and space is too small so that can‚Äôt make it better for the noise. I‚Äôm happy you have a good stay and thanks again for your sweet words, it‚Äôs my pleasure to host you. For any future guests I would like to add some information to this review:<br/><br/>In the weeks before the arrival of Dennis and his wife,  we had extreme rain in Amsterdam. On the day  they checked in, a leak occurred in the bathroom roof, so I had to turn off the ceiling lights. I offered to put temporary lighting in the bathroom, but they didn't want that. In the meantime there has been a roofer and the ceiling lights are working again.<br/><br/>Because only one of the two beds is adjustable, this is not discussed further in the advertisement.<br/><br/>The heating works great and is automaticly connected to the weather outside. Every room has its own radiator. Each radiator can be individually adjusted. For environmental reasons, all radiators are always turned off when there are no guests. If you arrive you can adjust the temperature of each room yourself.  Even the underfloor heating in the bathroom can be adjusted.<br/>.<br/>If you keep the bedroom door closed, you will not hear any street noise from the street. Thank you for your kind words. Looking forward to host again. Take care x Cynthia, Thank you very much for taking time to write this wonderful review.  Take care and hope to see you and your husband again soon. <br/>Sincerely, Gerald For next time: you can open the sky light in the bathroom and the window above the entrance door. That way you will have a draft of fresh air. <br/>And there is a choice of two fans. <br/>Thank you for your feedback.  Frans wrote even more about the space: ‚ÄúThe fact that the pictures were more than 100% accurate. The place looked perfect and was definitely what I needed for my 10day trip. It was also exactly what I paid for and even got an extra day for free... Though that was because I overslept and missed my flight and Gerald was completly understanding and went out of his way to make sure I did not miss my flight again by waking me up on the day and even organizing transport to the airport for me. Was an overall great experience and worth more than the value charged. ‚Äù<br/><br/>‚ÄúThe accomidation and my experience of Amsterdam was as near perfect ass could be. I can not think of anything that would have made my stay any more comfortable or convenient. If there was such a thing as 6 stars I would pick that‚Äù<br/> Thank you Kevin! See you soon and I hope to learn a new worth again!"

Wishing you good fun on your journey in Belgium and hope I may be so lucky to meet you again in the future. All the best to you both and your family! Greetings Vibeke Hi Szeki,<br/>Was great to meet you although unfortunately we did not get to spend as much time together as we may have liked. The flat for three adult guests is not the biggest (this is why it is stated in my add that the room is based on the confort for 2 adults). But I am happy to hear you enjoyed your saty in Amsterdam.<br/>I realized after you had checked out that there had been a complete WIFI- outage. This has now been fixed. As that was too late for you please have a look at your dashboard and follow the link to a the updated price. I think it is fair you should have some discount for missing wifi on your last 2 days. ;-)<br/><br/>Wishing you all the best in your future! Greetings Vibeke You were the most perfect guests! Greetings Vibeke Dear Suzanne,<br/>Indeed it was a shame we did not get to interact so much. Nonetheless I could understand are a very nice and repectful person and it was a pleasure to have you stay with me.<br/>Wishing you all the best and sending you greetings from Amsterdam.<br/>Vibeke Dear Dana, it was a pleasure to have you as my guest. <br/><br/>I am sorry however to hear about your feelings of the bedlinnen after your departure. You are the first guest to have this experience and I feel sorry that I did not know as it should of course not be like that. If only you had mentioned it while you were here I would have been happy to change them for others.<br/><br/>I hope you appreciated my flexibility with your arrival- and departure times which gave you maximum use of the apartment on this trip as you were able to chcek-in very early and depart very late.<br/><br/>Again many thanks for the lovely card and cute disco-duck you left me. Hi Marla,<br/><br/>It was great having you as my guest. Eventhough we unfortunately did not spend so much time together due to my schedule it was lovely have such calm, sweet ladies as my guests. Have a lovely time in Paris!<br/>All the best Vibeke Hi Anna and Alexey,<br/>Was great to meet you and have you as my guests.

Dear Irina and Jens, it is the wonderful guests that also make my day!! All the thanks to you. The cute easter bunnies have all been discovered, thank you so much for that sweet gesture as well as your generosity!<br/>All the best and may all good come to you both! Love Vibeke  Hi Franzisca, I had the best time hosting you! Indeed it felt more like having good friends visiting me!<br/><br/>I loved the halloren kugeln ....

Hi Juulia, it was a pleasure to host such a wonderfull enthusiatic lady such as yourself! Was great to meet you!<br/><br/> Hi Chandu, ik was as said a great pleasure to meet and host you! I had so much fun having you and your friends in the house and it felt as though good friends had left.<br/><br/>Many thanks for the lovely note you left me! All the best to you and a special greeting from Chandon (the dark haired cat) ;-)<br/> Es cierto que no hay wifi, tal vez usted no lo le√≠ste pero se indica en el anuncio que no tengo internet en mi casa. Es parte de mi estilo de vida de estar sin conexi√≥n a Internet o la televisi√≥n. <br/><br/>Pero, en parte por su referencia, me doy cuenta de que a la mayor√≠a de las personas no le gustan de estar sin internet. Por lo tanto, repensar de tomar internet con wifi en casa.<br/><br/>Tongas gracias por su descanso agradable y tiene una persona muy agradable.<br/>"

2302855,"Thanks Mathilde! And I think 'capricieux' is a spot-on description of Shouf:-) Wow, such great words. Thank you Craig! Thanks Melissa. Happy to hear you had such a great time and happy to read what you write about the house:-) Thanks to Google translate I could read your nice review. Thanks Hashim! Thank you Risa. And yes, I found the bottle of wine:-) Thanks. Will sure drink it. Too bad this is contrary to your Whatsapp message saying 'the cat is awesome and the house is perfect'. The house was perfectly clean when I left but of course gets dirty when you live there for 8 days, especially the black kitchen floor. About the size: it's 50 square meters, perfect for most people. The bathroom is small, but that's in the description. Maybe you have a different standard; all my other guests have been happy so far. I hope, despite your complaints, that you did have a good time.  Thanks Ollie for the great words! Seems like you felt like a local and discovered all the cool spots in the area. "
2309485,"Dear Jana, the fact that there are stairs is clearly indicated in the description of the place. Thanks for all the very positive points Simon. Indeed there are stairs, as is clearly mentioned in the listing. During the fall we usually wait until all the leaves have fallen before vacuuming. I'm sorry for your confusion, but use of the balcony is not listed. The washer and dryer have been working fine before and after your visit. Thanks for that feedback Utku. We will replace the sheets. Best, Ned Thank you Seba! There is a pull down curtain on the window, I guess not easily to see at first. For next time, then. :-) Thanks Dan for your review and feedback. Good one about the pillows; we'll get some new ones. Dear Alix, we are sorry for your experience. Indeed, the guests before you left the place an incredible mess and it seems for this one time we did not properly clean up afterwards. We will pay extra attention to this in the future.<br/>Next time please alert us immediately so that the problems can be fixed right away.<br/>Best wishes,<br/>Ned Thanks for your response Carolina, we will address the cleaning. <br/>We do not have a microwave oven here on purpose. This is also indicated in the description of the room. Thanks for your review Marielle. The problem with the toilet has been fixed now. Someone threw something in it which didn't belong, which created that noise.<br/><br/>Best wishes, Ned Thanks for your review Catherine.<br/><br/>I'm sorry about the bathroom odors. This is being fixed.<br/><br/>As far as the bed, it is a hard mattress and often we have had good comments about it, so I'm surprised but sorry to hear this. I will check it out. Sorry you had that experience Lisa. Indeed there are stairs as mentioned in the listing, very typical of Amsterdam houses. We will do better to make sure the bathroom is cleaner. Thanks Ana for your feedback. Dear Jiani, I'm sorry you had a problem in the bathroom. I wish you would have told me sooner, then I could have fixed it for you.<br/><br/>Best wishes, Ned Hi Chris, I'm sorry you had this problem. Indeed it was the hottest week of the year so far while you were here.<br/><br/>I wish you had let me know about this problem earlier when we were communicating. We have a 2nd fan and there are options to open more windows in the upper floor to help with circulation.<br/><br/>In any case, this year we are also putting in windows in the room so that should help in these extreme circumstances.<br/><br/>Best, Ned<br/><br/> Sorry about the shower - we will work on that.<br/><br/>About being cold, there is heating in the room. Details about how to turn it on are on the info sheet. Thank you for the feedback, Elsa."
2313061,"'Father, Mother and Margot still can't get used to the chiming of the Westertoren clock, which tells us the time every quarter of an hour. Not me, I liked it from the start; it sounds so reassuring, especially at night. ' wrote Anne Frank in her diary, 11 July 1942. Dear Sheila, you knew on forehand that we do not have elevator and that there are two stairs, but you booked it nonetheless. B&B‚Äôs in Amsterdam don‚Äôt have an elevator but for next time please be informed the larger hotels do. Glad to read you liked everything else ;) We never met. I don‚Äôt know who you spoke to at my front door but it was not me. My help did your laundry which is a free service, glad that worked out at least ;) Caro Simone, il codice per aprire l'armadietto viene sempre fornito da me una settimana prima del check-in. Se controlli lo troverai nei tuoi messaggi Airbnb. Hattie, in our house rules it‚Äôs made very clear no children can be allowed. You agreed to these rules when you booked. Your 2 star rating on this matter seems a bit unfair to me, because you knew this. However you decided not to bring the matter up and simply confront me with the situation. The matter is bringing your baby without informing me, has violated local law, because this resulted in exceeding the maximum of two persons per room. I have risked my license and a high fine letting you stay. Next time please consider the position of the host, these rules are unfortunately not in place because we like them. It‚Äôs the law. Hi Louise, thanks for your nice review. For future reference, the light switch of the toilet was next to the torch ;)  The torch is for emergencies. Sorry to read your experience with your private toilet. It was not shared, because both rooms have their own. I did notice the toilet was damaged and leaked, we repaired that. Next time just tell me during your stay so I can solve the matter immediately ;-) Sorry to read you misunderstood the pictures, but I hope I made it clear in the  room description that we offer a guest fridge in the pantry hall filled with free cooled water. This review is very helpfull and I will make it more clear that there is a guest fridge and I shall offer a small private fridge in the room. We stopped doing that because of the noise in the room. Thanks for reminding me. We have two rooms in the B&C and I.m sorry to read the guests coming home were somewhat noisy.  I sleep in the same floor and did not hear anything otherwise I would have said something. Next time just tell me so I can talk to the other guests immediately ;-)  You rented the room with a shared toilet and it's shared with me only, because the second Airbnb room I offer includes a private toilet in their bathroom. Maybe that room is better suited for you on your next visit. Looking forward welcoming you again. Hey Karen, thanks for the warning. Although you did not stay in the room, that room is indeed at the street side of one of the most popular nightlife districts in Amsterdam. During your stay we experienced extremely warm summer weather after two years of covid lock down and I hope you except our apology this was celebrated that specific night in the bars and restaurants in our street maybe a bit louder then you are used to. We never had complaints from guests about noise before, because when you book a room in Amsterdam centre one expects some street noise in the evening. I'm so happy that you stayed in the en-suite shower roomroom located at the back side of the building, so I assume you enjoyed your stay because it was quiet there ;-) Wat een bijzonder en lang verhaal over 10 seconden van wat duidelijk een misverstand is. Ik zei hoi, maar jullie reageerden niet en liepen door. Waarop ik uh zei om vervolgens aan te geven dat jullie toch echt te vroeg waren om de kamer in te gaan. Jij reageerde daar erg verbaasd over en keek op je horloge. Wegens het strenge coronaprotocol moeten hosts de kamer drie uur luchten waardoor ik de kamer op het laatste moment schoonmaak. Zo voorkomen we veel ellende. Daarom kun je voor de check-in tijd niet in de kamer. Je bent daar akkoord mee gegaan als gebruiker van Airbnb. Bovendien, je had het me later ook gewoon kunnen zeggen dat je een naar gevoel had bij het inchecken, ik was thuis en ik ben best aardig volgens mij ;) Om achteraf te schrijven dat het inchecken ongemakkelijk was en dit negatief te beoordelen vind ik jammer en een beetje onterecht. En je review hierover is echt onevenredig lang. Van de laatste 950 reviews ben je de winnaar. Gelukkig was de rest van je verblijf prima en was de schone op tijd opgeleverde kamer naar je zin!  Stay calm ;) Bedankt voor je review Nienke. Vervelend om te lezen dat je last had van de andere gasten. Je had even bij me aan kunnen kloppen dan had ik ze gezegd dat ze hun eigen toilet moesten gebruiken en niet die bij jullie. Dat is niet de bedoeling. Helaas zijn gasten noodgedwongen veel binnen nu alle caf√©s gesloten zijn en gaat er wel eens wat mis. Excuses daarvoor! Glad to read you enjoyed your stay. The water cooker is the large black machine in the window, not a kettle ;) I have put a label on it now, so thanks for the feedback! Schon dass Sie Ihren Aufenthalt bei mir genossen haben. Ab Juli 2020 verfugt das Zimmer uber eine eigene Toilette! Der 'Stadt' aber ist kein 10 minuten laufen, wir sind ja im Mitte ;-) We wished you had told us during your stay, because the wifi router in your room was switched. Maybe by accident you put the plugs out. Too late to solve it now, but we‚Äôll note it in our guests book. My room description and title as well as my many positive reviews leave no doubt you booked a room with an en-suite bathroom with just a shower and a sink. Your comment that this came as a surprise comes a bit as a surprise. I/m sorry your expectations where not met, but for future reference please first read what you book, then book it and not the other way around ;-) Dear Bobbi,  at the moment of your stay you were the only guests in the house. The roof door was left open by you, this fact was filmed on our security camera. The rain was very heavy that night and water came in ruining my wooden floor and floor heating. While you were there. Doing nothing. We do expect guests to act a bit responsible. Even had you not openend the door, when it rains hard as it did and the hallway is flooded you don't do nothing. Robert was working that night and I was, as you stated, not in Amsterdam that day. Therefore I send you the mail saying I was not happy with this and requested for your responsibility.. Also we do always serve breakfast. All reviews from our guests confirm that. Breakfast is however not served all morning, but our guests can always help themselves  and have breakfast very early or late. You came outside breakfast hours and all you needed to do if this was a problem was just ask Robert to help you. He lives in the house as you knew. You did not. Lastly, when you have problems with the water in the shower please tell us so when it occurs. Not afterwards when it is too late to fix it during your stay.. We fixed it meanwhile. So sorry to hear you experienced your stay badly. You are the first in many years that had problems looking at the hundreds of positive reviews we received. There is always room for improvement and will surely take your complaints into consideration. Thanks for the good remarks nonetheless. It confirm we must do something good as well. Regards, Marcel. Thansk Luciano, it was great hosting you. Regards from Amsterdam!  Helaas was jullie ervaring niet optimaal ,  hiervoor mijn excuses,ziekte en een gebrek aan communicatie  aan beide kanten speelde ons bij de planning nogal parten. <br/>Feedback en reviews zijn zeer welkom en steken we graag wat van op maar uitgebreid en gedetailleerd klagen op de site achteraf vind ik een beetje ongepast en zelfs een beetje laf . Directe communicatie  op het moment zelf aan het juiste adres of zelfs kritiek  bij vertrek was functioneler geweest en hadden we aan jullie situatie nog wat kunnen doen .. Een gemiste kans  Thanks Daniel. Looking forward to meet you again on your next visit to Amsterdam! Dear Rayco, your review is not about us. First of all every room has windows. And we rent out rooms only, not a kitchen. We do not offer a shared kitchen either. Please adjust your review accordingly, not to confuse future Airbnb users. Thanks ;) Thank you for your lovely review and for being one of my favorite returning guests. Until we meet again;) Thanks Jena, looking forward to seeing you back! The heater was located under the table. Next time just ask, I was af home all the time ;) You are absolutely right the chemical toilet is not ideal. During covid we installed the extra toilet in your private shower-& bathroom for extra comfort, besides the permanent toilet next to your bathroom that you also could use. You did use both surely. The current plastic toilet will be replaced by a ‚Äòreal‚Äô stone one now we can finally hire construction workers again, so you are invited to try it out next visit! Es kommt jetzt ein echtes klo! Leider hatten wir wegen covid nicht die M√∂gklichkeit. Thank you for your review. Stay safe! Merci! Thanks for the feedback. The heineken was on me ;) Proost! Thank you Nathan for your nice review. I hope you are all fine back home in this strange time. Au revoir, Marcel. Seko, you are either very confused and notreasonable. You booked a room without tv and without kitchen, as you can see in the Airbnb room description, hence to complain about this absence is not very fair is it? Also my home is at the same floor as your room was and not below. You could have just knocked my door and ask if there was anything. The room comes with 6 towels, 4 of them are inside the cabinet. Lastly you were high all the time, smoked in the room and left the room very dirty behind. Your review is the first negative review I ever had, just check the reviews of guests before you. I wonder what really is the issue here. Sorry you did not contact me earlier during your stay, maybe I could have helped you with your real problems. Communication was very very complicated with this guests who did not understand any English. The bathroom is private but separate which is clearly stated in the room description. I did walk in twice to fix the boiler that is in there and tried to explain it. The mezzanine is too small for the giant suitcases they had which is not safe in case of fire emergency. When I offered to bring them down in the morning they said it was at 9:30. When I was there they had long left (?). I always try my best for my guests and believe my room descriptions are clear. We have a room with a bathroom inside and one with one outside. This review is in my opinion very unfair and based on misunderstandings due to a language barri√®re. Sorry for that. Dear AReum, we are very sorry you were not satisfied with your booking. However you booked a room in my house and not a private apartment, so your complaints it is not that private is surprising. The bathroom is private as well and is not use by other guests at all. What you refer to is the toilet in the hallway. I did ask you partner to check that specific toilet floor after he used it, because other guests complained about the wet floor he left behind. For future bookings I recommend you first check the booking specifics in Airbnb before you book it and afterwards complain it is not what you wanted. Regards, Marcel. Sorry for the hot weather, we got a fan now and we hope for more of such hot days in Amsterdam. Thanks for staying with me, it was great to get to know you a bit, good memories. Good luck with the paper bag floor ;-) <br/>Regards from Amsterdam, Marcel."

2425674,"Thank you for your kind words. It was great to host you. Welcome anyime. Thank you Katie for your warm words. Welcome back any time. Thank you Faisal for your kind words. Welcome back anytime. Thank you for kind review! Welcome back anytime. Hi Kristen, thank you for your nice note! Will have a look at an AC but with the climate and temperatures being low in The Netherlands I always take the few warm days for granted. As for for your personal note: I will mention next time were hairdryer is. I specially bought one for rentals. Hope your trip back to the states was swift. Thank you Antonio for staying at the Loft. Welcome back anytime. Thank you for your nice words Anna! Happy you enjoyed The Loft! Hi Dave, thank you for your review. As you are from Canada I think you are not used to steep stairs that are very common in Amsterdam. All apartments in the centre of Amsterdam have them. The stairs in my house are compared to other Amsterdam city houses not steep at all as the house is 19 century house and not in a 17th or 18th century building. Unfortunately this is something I can not change as the house is a city monument. I will have a look at your suggestion to install blinds on the French doors. Thank you for the tip and thank you again for booking The Loft. "
2439449,"This is exactly why the council of Amsterdam wants to forbid Airbnb because Amsterdam inhabitants  experience nuisance. I live in the house so I notice and can take responsibility on a friendly way when guests are making trouble. Fortunately it is seldom necessarily to warn. So sorry Morgan for the noise. We were  surprised by it too. Such things can happen in Amsterdam.  Teresa, Rachel and Laura, thank you so much for your nice present.So sweet from you, <br/>I am very happy with it and he has got a special place in my sitting room. Hi Miriam,<br/>Thanks for informing me about moving furniture in the apartment above. Since 2 weeks there is a new owner , she probably is still in her removal. Sorry for the noise."
2480643,"I just found your sweets, thank you, they are really nice!  Hi Tiril, I just came home and found your lovely note. I'm very glad you had a good time. It is so nice to have people in my house that enjoy it like you did! Hope your interrailtrip was  a succes! "
2504583,"Thank you very much for your kind review! It was my pleasure to have you! Thank you very much for the positive review! Hi Sean, thanks for your positive review! Regarding the stairs, actually the stairs are quite unusually spacious (and not so steep) for Amsterdam standards and you can see it as a good workout :-) Thanks for your positive review. Currently they are building a tunnel in front of the apartment which will open this summer. That means that the traffic will be reduced from daily 22.000 ""vehicle movement"" to almost nothing. Thanks Tobias & Tabea for your kind words. Happy to read you had a great time! Thank you Anna & Ekaterina for your review. Glad that all my efforts to give you the best experience worked out as planned! Hope to welcome you again! Thank you very much for your kind words and you are most welcome to visit again! Thanks Elie for your positive review and I'm happy you enjoyed yourselves. Thank you Manon for your positive review. My purpose was to make my place so attractive and enjoyable as possible and apparently I succeeded :-) I am glad you guys liked it so much and you are most welcome to visit again."

Good suggestion about the bikes! I didn't know that. Julia thank you very much. You make me blush. I think also Roels effort is partly responsible For your joy. I am happy too that you had a good time."

2541099,"Hi Rosalyn, what a shame you did not like the place. I think you missed the info about the bed, that was send by email. It is a normal bed size. I wish you would have asked for extra towels they are always available. We do care about the environment, so we don't put them down. I would suggest better communication for you next time if you find problems. That are always things to sort out. Or book a hotel. Take care We truly believe our appartment was up to par and was cleaned really well. We think Despoina double booked appartments/hotels within the group and were trying to get away with paying less in one of them, or somehting in those lines. She was really hysterical and out of touch with reality. <br/><br/>If you are interested in her 'photos' then please ask us, we have them, There is nothing really to see. The house was spotless, they just took fotos of non-relevant things like stuff on the hallway from our neighbours, a very good clean cast-iron pan (wich naturally colours by age and usagem which she saw as non-cleanness, she has obviously never cooked before with good cast-iron pans), the 2 missing knobs on our oven (these knobs are non-functional stove knobs, as there is new stove atop the oven. <br/><br/>We had left one wall with coat rack free for their use, and another wall had our things on it. So they took a photo of our wall and send it to Airbnb.<br/><br/>Then a foto of a record player. Nothing to see, maybe they were just really impressed with it :).<br/><br/>So to be clear, the fotos on our profile are our real fotos. No one is being deceived. We actually have soap in 3 different places :). I always find it ashame when guests are not happy at my place. It does not happen that often. I think it is important for these guest to see the meaning of airbnb again.  Hi Celine, <br/><br/>what a shame, the cleaner must have forgotten to take it. Sorry about that! About the hamac, shame you did not find this one, it is still there, only we keep it next to our couch inside. Really nice to use on the roofterrace!<br/>You are totally right about the TV, it broke down a few months ago and I never realised that that would be a matter for guests traveling, I never watch telly on my holidays. But thanks for giving me notice about that I will change that on the profile. At least you could have enjoyed Amsterdam a bit longer in the ciy :  ) Nayna stayed at my apartment for three nights.  Sorry to hear that they did not had the experience that they expected. Their expectation was different, shame! They had the feeling that I did not clean the apartment as I of course did. Never had trouble with guest before, maybe good for hem to discuss more in advance what they expect. Do hope they had a great time in Amsterdam!<br/><br/>ps; in Amsterdam a lot of the houses have steep stairs. I am quite luckey mine are not that bad :  ) Thank you Jonathan, the plants are growing perfect :  ) Hi Thomas, great to hear that you met TOM the house mouse. Normally he never shows himself. He only visits when there is food left out on the table sealed or unsealed.. Tom is a very smart mouse, with a great sense of smell. Like a lot of other houses in Amsterdam mice come and go. Tom really seems to like my place like most of my airbnb guests : )!"
2569931,"Dear Margie,<br/>Thanks for the very kind review, I'm happy you enjoyed it so much!<br/>And special thanks for the Bailey's (which I love:), that I can save for October, already looking forward to it!<br/>All the best to you and your family, also from Roemer,<br/>Harriet"
2574458,"Thank you Canan, hope to see you back one day! Hi Barbara, I'm sorry to read that my apartment didn't meet your expectations and it was difficult to find your way in Amsterdam."
2580855,"Thank you! Always welcome again! Thank you! You were wonderful guests! Merci, Noemie, welcome again! It was nice to have you as guests! Thank you for your remark, Cyril. But in Holland we don't have the tradition of shutters, we have curtains ;) Martine  Thank you for your nice words!"
2597146,"I'm sorry that the experience was not up to your expectations. The heating in the rooms went on and it felt very warm when I checked them (to our standards). I understand that it is very different from the tropical temperature that is common for you. Your complaint about the matrasses too soft is the first complaint I had. Of course this is a personal feeling. Staircases in Amsterdam are usely steep and often spiral. This is the case for all our staircases as our houses are small compared to that of other countries. Our weather is indeed sometimes too rainy and too cold. All in all, I'm sorry that you weren't able to make the best of it and enjoy the beautiful museums and the architecture of Amsterdam. Thanks for your great recommendation. I'm glad that your first airbnb experience was positive. I hope you'll find the opportunity to travel to all the beautiful places of our planet. I wish you all the best and see you again! Dear Simone,<br/><br/>Thank you so much for your kind words. You're welcome whenever you want to.<br/><br/>Kind regards,<br/>Mathilde Hi Dmitry,<br/><br/>Thank you so much for your positive words.

2639261,Thanks for your great review :) glad to hear you had such a great time together. Enjoy your weekend and hope to see you again in the future. Julie left our apartment in perfect condition. It was easy to communicate everything to here in advance. Hope you had a great time in Amsterdam!  Dear Steve. Wow - thank you for taking the time to write such a detailed review. It was an absolute pleasure to host you and your girlfriend and you are most welcome back any day - you were awesome guests! Please pm us if you're planning to come next time! 
2651625,"Thank you for the feedback. Pleasure to host your family. <br/><br/>I do have to note that climbing the stairs to the 4th floor is clearly mentioned in the advertisement and I did remind this also in our communication prior to the check in."
2674028,"Hi Bekir, <br/>Unfortunately you didn't like the apartment like my other guests. Next time, please try to cancel inside the free cancellation periode, that will prevent a lot of frustration on your side I guess. I'm sorry I could not grant your request for free cancellation on the day of arrival. And such a pity your flights were cancelled. I can imagine that's not a nice way to start a weekend. <br/>My cleaning lady was not charmed by the way you treated her, by the way. Please try to realise that she was just doing her job.<br/>And about all other things you said: such a pity you didn't understand my house rules, the advert and the house manual correctly. For the future I'd recommend to ask things first, before judging. Might prevent frustrations as well...<br/>Safe trip home! bedankt voor de tips. ja die slaapbank was wit en moet vervangen worden. de stoelen zijn expres allemaal verschillend dat is in de stijl van het warehouse appartement. ik wil het niet zoals thuis maken maar iets bijzonders . daarom allerlei verschillende stoelen. <br/>daarnaast wordt het appartement natuurlijk intensief gebruikt en is er soms wat kalk aanslag maar dat houden we ook regelmatig bij hoor! :)<br/>bednakt voor uw verblijf! groet Taco What a recencie. I do not know why some guests are like that. We guarantee full 100% for our cleaning. And the strange thing is that the guests do not inform us. We are available 24 hours a day. It is a shame that these guests found it so dirty now better to book a luxury hotel. there are aa lot of muskito in AMsterdam because of all the water in the canalls . please use the muskito mazes to put infront of the windows . <br/> warm regards Taco  thank you the bar is very nice and accross the water it is a very good restaurant as well. it is called 'de ceuvel' thank you so much for staying with us !! greetings Taco  thank you so  much !!<br/>taco super thanks for your stay !! and off course always welcome again!!.<br/> gr. Taco  thanxs for your advices I will do that for sure. and thanxs for staying ! hope to see you next time... taco  super thanxs for you r comment!. you are offcourse welcome again ! I hope to see you soon with a new group of friends.. cheers Taco and Tiffany  Thanks Katharina for your nice comments.<br/> thank you for staying with my warehouse. <br/> warm regards Taco  merci veaucoup! pour votre reaction et review . merci et toujour bienvenue  o.k. i will put a flatiron there good idea. and there wil be more hanger space soon. we are just opened so not everything is there. yet  als u mij even belt dan had ik de code gegeven van het sleutel kastje en had u meteen naar binnen gekund . klein foutje is menselijjk natuurlijk vind u ook niet?  Ik hoop dat u het verder wel heel leuk hebt gehad? groetjes Taco ik heb het aangepast overal in mijn advertentie. ik zie niet waar nu nog staat dat het 200 euro was . kan je aangeven waar ? <br/>1060/5000<br/>This recencie is not correct. We require ‚Ç¨ 100 extra deposit on arrival to ensure that our apartment is left tidy. From experience we can conclude that this does not always happen. The house rules state that you leave the apartment behind as soon as you find it. This means washing dishes put garbage in the container outside and putting furniture etc back. Cleaning and using the beds we do. As for the beds that were not made up. It may be if you arrive before the check-in time that the cleaning lady is not ready yet. However, the check-in is official after 3 pm. Rubbish that it takes too long to the city. By public transport you are within 10 minutes at the central station. that is where the center begins. If you want to travel further into the city, it is logical that you have to take several trams. With regard to dust, etc., we ensure that every cleaning is carried out with the utmost care. If you have any comments or concerns, we always ask you to contact Jacqueline directly.<br/>You always love disgruntled guests. we make it clean every time when people are comming . I dont know what was not clean . please let me know . there are only muskito's , they make a random patern on your skin. please use the muskito maszes in front of the windsows .  thank you for the tip . i will put blinds on the internal windows as well! . thank you for staying with us ! .<br/> Taco  thank you Ben .<br/> i think Hayat after this debacle . i have send her away. she was unbelievelbe difficult to get to do the things normal. <br/> but thank ou for your patience. now the new hostess is a relief.

But I can follow up on your suggestion on bedside lamps, never thought of it and never heard a suggestion of previous guests. Thanks for the tip. Hey Jessica! Thank you for the feedback! As of now I changed the description and the information of the apartment. I hope this will fall inline with the expectations with future guests."

Very interestingly arranged and rethought, the space gave staying in the home of Barbara and Arjan a lot of pleasure and comfort. Behind the house is a small garden equipped with benches and a table, a perfect place to spend long summer evenings. Barbara and Arjan really helped us organize our stay in Amsterdam. They provided us with detailed information on getting to their home from the airport or a list of places to visit in the area, of course, along with directions on how to reach them. It was a very accurate guidance that has saved us a lot of time. In addition, they provided us with their bikes, and welcome waiting for us was a nice gift in the form of wine and sensational Dutch cheese :)) Absolutely 10/10, recommend !!! ""<br/><br/>Very cool location, in a quieter area while still allowing you to walk to the very center within a reasonable time. Garden behind the house - a great advantage!

Spring time is lovely on the terrace! And thank you for your understanding! :-) Oh my goodness! That is the longest review ever. haha Thank you so much for your generous compliments. we are glad you had such a lovely stay in our humble home. :-) Oh, i can see how that might have happened. we had to dust a few days earlier to prep for our pending vacation and cristina came a couple days after that so the house had been idle for almost a week, which is ample time for new  dust to settle. sorry about that! glad you enjoyed for the rest. :-) Oh thank you Alson! what beautiful words. We do aim to make our house as cosy as possible! I am glad you could feel that. Thank you for being such easy going guests and loving the house as if it were your own. :-)  Hi Jessie!  <br/>I am glad you enjoyed your stay in our house. Thank you for the American goodies you left behind! :-) Yay! thank you for the lovely review. perhaps we see you next year!!! :-) "

3007402,"Dear Reem, <br/>Sorry you didn‚Äôt like the beds. <br/>Other guests ask me where to buy them because they slept like a baby. <br/>We renew them yearly so I think it‚Äôs a matter of taste. <br/>The sauna door has dark glass so nobody can see you but you‚Äôre right that people can look into the garden.  We are not that shy I think Hi Christopher, <br/>Thank you very much for your review and your stay with us.<br/>We are very sorry that the room wasn‚Äôt up to our usual standard when you arrived. That‚Äôs never happened before and it‚Äôs inexcusable when you book a stay. We completely understand how you feel.<br/>As we explained, there had been a mix up with the cleaning company. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs been a very crazy week for us which meant we didn‚Äôt have time to check in time. Still, that doesn‚Äôt excuse it: therefore we turned it around within an hour and really tried to make sure the remainder of your stay was above and beyond. On top of that, we‚Äôve offered you to take everything for free from the mini bar and a free boat trip to make up for our mix up. And we‚Äôve asked if there was anything else we could do to make up for our mistake.<br/>Therefore, your review feels a bit unfair. Although it hasn‚Äôt happened before, making a mistake is human. It‚Äôs also about how you handle the aftermath when something does happen. <br/>Again: we don‚Äôt excuse that the room wasn‚Äôt clean when you arrived. We thoroughly apologise for that again and we would have loved to be able to change that before your arrived.<br/>We‚Äôre happy to hear you‚Äôve enjoyed your stay otherwise and we would definitely love to welcome you back again. We‚Äôd happily offer you another - more pleasant - stay. If you would have considered our offers or have time for the boat trip, we‚Äôre sure that would really enhance your experience. <br/>Hope you have a great day and safe onwards journey, <br/>All the best, <br/>Diewert Thank you for your nice words!<br/>Please come back sometimes than I offer you a boattrip . Thank you for your nice words!<br/>You are always welcome in our bnb. <br/>Enjoy the summer Thank you for your nice words.<br/>You‚Äôre always welcome in our mini boatel !üòâ Thank you for your nice words!<br/>You‚Äôre always welcome! Dear Sarah, really happy to hear you had such a lovely time on our boat! It was a pleasure hosting you, will be visiting us again in the future? Dear Julia, I'm really excited to hear you had such a lovely time. Hope to be hosting you again in the future! Dear Cecile, thank you so much for taking the time to write me this amazing review.

3015785,"Hello,<br/>I am sorry you were not happy. But are you sure that there was not something else going on?<br/>Here is what you said to me during your first message:<br/>-----<br/>‚ÄúI'm Sorry, but we found the room dirty, can we ask you tuo clan it better?<br/>I'm very sad to tell you this and very sorry.<br/>The bed, the floor, plates...‚Äù<br/>-----<br/>I left work and was there 20 minutes later. I asked about the plates, but you said you had cleaned them already.<br/>I asked about the floor, and you couldn‚Äôt even show me one spot on the floor that was dirty.<br/>I asked about the bed and the supposed spot was the tag from the mattress pad that you could see through the sheet.<br/>Still, I completely cleaned the room for you again, vacuumed, mopped, cleaned every surface and changed the bed. I even bought new, big towels like you asked for.<br/>You seemed satisfied and never said a thing about dust or smells.<br/>I sent another message the next day asking if everything was ok and you didn‚Äôt respond.<br/>I am sorry, but whatever was bothering you was not the fault of the room.<br/>Erik<br/> Thanks so much! Sorry about the noise. The roof needed repairs, and I did my best to hold them off until after 9:00. Thanks for being a perfect guest! It was a pleasure to have you. Happy travels! Thanks for being great guests! It was a pleasure to have you as our guest. Wow! Thanks so much! We work hard to offer a nice welcome, and wonderful guests like yourselves make it enjoyable. Happy travels! Cheers! Glad you enjoyed it. Thanks for the kind words! Sorry about the noise. We have had double glass installed and that is really about all we can do. Thanks for your understanding. It is central Amsterdam and there are sometimes noisy people in the city.<br/>Thanks again for being wonderful guests! It was wonderful to have you as a guest. Please come back any time! Thanks to you for being wonderful guests. Well thanks very much. We certainly do appreciate it. The double glass windows are a welcome new addition, and they sure do keep the noise down.<br/>Thanks for staying with us and we hope to see you again sometime. It was great to have you. Thanks for both visits, and we look forward to many more! We love our place, and it was a pleasure to share it with you. We enjoyed having you as our guests. Thanks so much. Thanks so much! It was a pleasure to have you. Hi,<br/>Thanks for the kind words. I am sorry the paint bothered you. We are finishing our remodeling soon.<br/>Erik It was an absolute pleasure to have the two of you stay with us. We look forward to seeing you again some time. I am sorry you were not happy with our place, and I wish you would have said something to me at the time while I could have addressed your concerns.<br/>The mattress and foundation are brand new and so should be very comfortable. Also, you failed to tell me that you damaged them by spilling red wine in bed.<br/>There are extra pillows in the bedside nightstand, which you somehow overlooked. There is also a table with two chairs for hanging out- not ideal, but most people who come to Amsterdam don‚Äôt spend too much time in the room. There is also the small rooftop terrace with plants and flowers. <br/>There are many wonderful restaurants in our busy neighborhood, so maybe that is what you were smelling. Or was it the Jasmine flowers that bothered you? Or perhaps the dirty dishes you left unwashed or even rinsed? <br/>I feel you would be better served staying in a full service hotel, where they don‚Äôt mind cleaning up after your mess.<br/> Thanks so very much for the kind words! We try very hard to make a nice space for our guests, and I am very glad you enjoyed your stay. Thanks so much for staying with us. Thanks for staying with us. It was a pleasure to host you. What a cool surprise for your girlfriend! Thanks so much! It was a pleasure to have you as our guests, and we are very happy you enjoyed our place. It was great to have you as our guest, and a pleasure to provide whatever assistance we could offer. Hope to see you again sometime soon! It was fun to have you stay with us. Happy travels! It was a pleasure to have you as our guest. I am very happy that you enjoyed your stay. Thanks for joining us, and I hope the rest of your trip is great. We love this city and we love our place. Glad you enjoyed it too. It was a pleasure to have you both as guests. I am glad you liked our place. I am glad you had a good time. Please come back any time. It was an honor to have you as our guests. Sorry about the latch in bathroom. The painters left it off, and I have now replaced it."
3018316,"Thank you so much, such a joy to welcome you wonderful pair! Thank you Gail, although disappointed about your 4 stars of course. We have on purpose no AC as we try to live as sustainable as possible and the Dutch climate hardly ever reaches more than 27 degrees Celsius and even then the room is cool. So I wonder what you mean... am I missing something? Please let me know. Thank you. Thank you so much, you are so so so much welcome, any time. Enjoy the wonderful trip ahead of you.

Wishing you a wonderful trip and hope to see you coming back. üß° Sorry Eva, I am seriously disappointed in your four stars review: if anything is not good enough according to your standards , let me know right away so I can help you. For example to explain the shower and to find the flipflops and the rugs. Thank you for being our guests. Thank you so much Michael & Chris for being our wonderful guests. You are very welcome.

PS  I was lucky to be able to be flex about arrival times... only this special time;) 15 minutes? There is action anywhere here.. as also are amazing places on the corner of every street, like within 100 till 200 meter: from Ela till Festina Lente, Eland, cocktailbar Oldenhof, Parry, etc. So where did you go 15 minutes away... üò≥üòè Thank you so much Helene, it has been hectic in my professional life but you were fantastic guests. Thank you. Thank you Ryan, has been a pleasure to host you. Thank you Cory, I like the plan you buy a property in this amazing city & country... however, be prepared, real estate is costly and taxes are on income, property and expenditures... Still worth it:) Thank you so much Erica, such a joy to welcome the two of you. Most welcome any time. All the best and thank you so much... Thank you! Dear Nicelio, thank you so much for your beautiful review and thank you for being wonderful guests. The tram is closeby but important for guests: you don't hear it in the house right? Wishing you all the best, most welcome any time. Thank you. Thank you so much Stephanie, I love your specific description of the comfort. I hope it helps guests to opt for cosy autumn in Amsterdam... miserable weather sometimes but yet so much comfort and cosy venues closeby. With the lovely lights everywhere... Thank you so much Bettina, has been a pleasure. You have been mild on us. Thank you. Thank you so much Solveig, it has been a pleasure to welcome you. Most welcome any time. As for plates and cutlery: just ask next time, more than willing to provide you some to eat something in the garden of to prep a simple breakfast. Particularly as a relatively green thinking person, love providing that. Thank you so much, it has been a genuine pleasure to host you. Wishing you all the best, Corina & Emiel Thank you so much Daniel, wonderful to host you. Most welcome any time. Wishing you all the good!

Best, Corina Thank you so much John, we consider ourselves the best location since we are in the heart of the city of Amsterdam, and all the highlights are all within walking distance. You also explored way beyond and around by public transport as well. That is also part of our location, we are very well connected. Thank you so much for being wonderful guests. Thank you. Thank you so much Joan, most welcome any time. You have been wonderful guests while I was not around. Thank you. Thank you Christopher, you have been a wonderful guest while I was not around. Thank you so much. Thank you so much Amanda, most welcome always. Thank you so much Korynne, wonderful compliments!!! Hope to see you again. Thank you Kathleen, I love the idea that Amsterdam and our place was so perfect that we can only improve it by the little shelf in the garden. Wonderful compliment. However, we actually have a solution if you had told me about it... it is a magnet with a hook so we can hang the soap on the hook. Only available on request:) Thank you so much Krystle, lovely to meet you. Best, Corina Thank you so much Lori, such a pleasure to host you. Thank you. Thank you Jona, most welcome! Thank you Benedetto, such a pleasure to host you two. Most welcome next time. Thank you Ian, for your valuable feedback. It is true that we prefer to limit the heating of the room (in winter) up to 20 degrees Celsius (a bit more), due to all kind of reasons... sustainability, energy crisis, etc. Thank you for addressing that issue... Thank you so much Varadhan, most welcome any time. :) Thank you so much Karen, all the best! Thank you so much Ellie, such a pleasure to host you. Dear Tamara, what happened? During your stay all was good and you were excited about everything... and now you down me with 3 stars? What happened? Please let me know. Thank you Sofia, so lovely to host people like you. Thank you so much. Thank you so much Monique, such a pleasure to host you two. Most welcome. All the best, Corina Merci beaucoup a vous Sebastien, vous etes bienvenus. Thank you so much Arj & Annie, many thanks to you! Thank you so much Joseluis, wishing you all the best and most welcome anytime. Best, Corina Thank you so much fellow Superhost:) Dear JC, what has happened? Please let me know. Best, Corina Dear Pranav, thank you so much. Please be aware that as our guest, you need to be comfortable. So use the heaters as much as you need. Certainly did not want you to be uncomfortable or in a chilly place! The heaters heat up the room high speed: within 5 minutes it is above 20 degrees Celsius. That is why we ask guests -due to the gass crises-  to turn of the heaters when not there. Sorry if I have not been clear about this and if that has caused you inconveniences, my sincerest apologies. Thank you Colin,  great pleasure to host you. Wow, thank you so much Cassie, it has been a pleasure to host you. Thank you. Thank you so much Elise... has been a pleasure to host you. Thank you so much Cecil, such a pleasure to host you. Thank you. Thank you so much William for this wonderful feedback! Thank you so much Jessica. Such a pleasure to host you. Wonderful, thank you! Thank you Gabriel, it has been a pleasure to host you. Wishing you all the best! Wonderful, you are most welcome! Thank you Sandy! Merci Muriel:) Thank you Thomas, good to hear Amsterdam is an unforgettable and happy memory in your life. Wonderful you are so appreciative for the goodbye... it certainly was an early hour of the day:) Thank you. As Airbnb-hosts are incredibly service minded, next time just ask for more drawer space. As for furniture in a guest room there are multiple dilemma's: some prefer extra bedding and extra pillows, other prefer extra space for clothes. For me as a host it is very easy to take out the bedding and/or pillows and provide you with extra space in the drawer. The only thing difficult to manage is the ""messy"" entrance of our house: with our different shoes and coats that match all weather, the boat motor charging... and some sport utilities hanging around in the entrance hall. Sorry for that. Wow Alana, thank you so much! Toutes mes excuses pour le bruit des voisins un peu plus loin sur Stefan. Le projet de construction est presque termin√© et nous sommes de retour dans l'endroit extr√™mement calme de la ville anim√©e d'Amsterdam. Thank you Sarah! Wonderful, thank you so much. You are most welcome... such a pleasure to host you. Thank you so much Alison, you are most welcome and highly recommendable yourselves... You came in as wonderful couple and so you left, thank you so much for being wonderful guests... such a pleasure to host you. Most welcome! How wonderful, thank you so much Maria Juliette, the pleasure to meet is mutual, wonderful to host you and thank you so much for staying here. We look forward to welcome you again. All the best, stay healthy... Thank you so much, you are most, most, most welcome. All the best and hope to welcome you again. :) Thank you so much, such a pleasure to host you. Wishing you all the best and see you again! Thank you so much Rachel, such a pleasure to welcome you and your husband. Glad you have had a wonderful time in Amsterdam. Thank you so much Stephan, you are most welcome! Thank you so much Rebecca, it was a pleasure to see you both so happy! Thank you Mohammed for being our guests. Of course you can use the heaters (2 extra besides of the central heating) so that you can heat up the place easily up till 23 degrees Celsius if it is really cold outside. Something must have gone wrong in my explanation: one heater is for the longer hours, one only to speed up heating for 20 minutes or so... The up speeder is not meant for the longer hours since we are trying to live sustainable but comfort for our guests comes first comes first of course... Thank you Adiel, it has been a pleasure to host you! Wonderful Loren, you and your friend are very very welcome! Thank you. Thank you Bernhard, you safe my face here... 1000 thanks. ;) Thank you so much Khalid, you are most welcome again... and you are a very recommendable 5 star guest... Thank you soooo much, you are 100% recommendable too! Dear Carrie, what happened... I have only seen you happy and then you give me 3 stars? Thank you beautiful couple:) Thank you Oleg, see you next time? Thank you so much Debby & Nadia, you are lovely & wonderful guests! Thank you so much Samantha, you (and your travel friend!) are most welcome! Thank you Paul, it was a pleasure to host you and your wonderful girlfriend! To be clear for future guests: Anne Frank is 400 meter away, Noordermarkt is 800 meter away, Museum square is 1500 meter away, 9 shopping streets is 250 meter away, tram is also 250 meters away... So yes, you will walk a lot but tremendous rewarding walk full of highlights... Thank you so much, see you next time! Wishing you all the best in the time in between! PS Apologies from the key-specialist! Thank you so much Ramin, such a pleasure to host you! Dear Cathy, you and your husband are a wonderful couple and you were very welcome to stay in our place in the heart of the favorite area of Amsterdam the Jordaan, the city center of Amsterdam. However, I do not appreciate you valuation of your stay with the remark about ""the host does not want visitors beyond the reserved guests"". I am totally fine with your family coming over for a drink, but your whole family (5!) has slept on the bed... so I think it is/was reasonable of me to address this issue: it is a two person room only available for the two persons who book it. And as for the tv: it is not available on this moment and that is/was written in the description when you booked and during your stay. Will fix that asap. Enjoy your holiday. Wonderful, thank you so much... you are most welcome!!! Thank you so much! Great tips & suggestions, thank you. Thank you Ben! Thank yo so much Laurie, you are most welcome... My pleasure Walter, thank you. Thank you Deb for your great feedback. Thank you so much!!! Thank you Jessie, a pleasure to host happy guests like you. Thank you Granny, great inspiration you are the way you travel with your travel company. Will keep that in mind & memory. Thank you so much Nan, was lovely to host you and your daughter... love to meet happy people like you. Thank you, we love you too:) Thank you so much Terry & Nora! Merci beaucoup! Thank you Norma and Norman, such a pleasure to know you love our place too... glad to hear you love the Thai too... they love you too! All the best, Corina Thank you so much Grisan, you and your daughter, love all around. Wonderful! Thank you so much Jess & Steve, you are gold. Was so busy during your stay... glad you enjoyed our place, Amsterdam and me. Thank you for being such wonderful guests. Thank you, it was a pleasure to host you. Obrigade Cristiane! Thank you so much! You are most welcome any time! Wonderful David & Ileana,  thank you! Thank you Lewis! Thank you so much Joshua for being fantastic and easy going guests. All the best, Corina Thank you Sarah, it was a pleasure to host you. The kingsize bed is a so called lit jumeaux with he length of 2,2 meter, that is the kingsize. I have learnt that is confusing. The new bed that is already ordered and that will be installed per beginning of March 2019 will be an electronically adjustable two person bed with a two person top matras, 1,8 meter by 2 meter. Top quality mattresses again. But looking even nicer and serving even more comfort. Looking forward to it and I hope you will love that bed also. See you next time I hope! Thank you so much Sally and Mitchell, it was a pleasure to host you. Most welcome again! Wonderful Ramit, such a pleasure to host you and your beautiful wife. Have a fast & safe flight back home. All the best and hope to see you again! Thank Thank you Anna! Wow, thank you Krista, such a pleasure to host you and your friend. Most welcome again! Wonderful, such a pleasure to meet & host people like you. Thank you so much Elizabeth, such a pleasure to meet you and you are most welcome again. Thank you May for your feedback .The guest place is the ground floor of our house. We share the entrance of the house but you have your private room, private bathroom and toilet, and the private garden. All non smoking as described in the text. You have all your privacy and the house is locked with your own key. So why would you like to lock the separate room? Great Ethan, you are most welcome! Thank you Catherine, it was a pleasure to host you. The wide angle pictures (made by Airbnb) are meant to provide you with an overview of the place, certainly not to mislead you. The place is something like 28-30m2 exclusive the garden and the entrance. We will soon include a drawer so you have contributed to the convenience of our place with your remark. Thank you! thank you so much Molly, wonderful to meet you and most welcome again. Thank you for the tip to put a rug in the bathroom... on request it is now available. :) Thank you Will! Wow Lou, never heard of the word ""bubbly"" but when I looked it up, it is the greatest compliment possible for me as a host with a small company in vitality programs... THANK you. Thank you so much, you are very welcome! Thank you Christopher, most welcome! Thank you Bobbie & Sam, it was a pleasure to host you! Thank you Cat! Thank you, it was an easy pleasure to host you while we were on holiday. Thank you so much.  Thank you so much Kristin! :) Seriously John, attitudes come in varieties but in this case I have to correct you. You rented a spic & span clean room at our place in the heart of the city and that cleanliness is important for me as a host. In spite of your worries before arrival it is even nice and cool in spite of really hot temperatures in the city this summer (2018), without airco! That the garden is just a nice complementary nice green place outside, not a manicured garden, that is for sure. The entrance is the entrance of a messy household, as described but I can imagine that disappointed you if you assumed you had rented the whole castle. Sorry. Will work on that. Thank you for sharpening me.  Thank you so much Zack, you are most welcome!  Thank you! Thank you so much Marvilyn, so wonderful to meet happy couples like you.  Thank you so much, it was great to meant you!!! Thank you so much Chris, THIS is the city center:) Wonderful and you are lovely guests! Thank you Kaitlyn, my pleasure!  Wonderful Sheila & Lulu, thank you! Thank you, most welcome next time. :)  Thank you friends!  Thank you Franco & Marianne, such a pleasure to meet you. Most welcome again!! :)Thank you. Thank you Valerie!  Thank you Han, it was a pleasure to host you. Best, Corina  Thank you so much Helen, wonderful to host you and your partner. Ouch, painful feedback. True, Amsterdam is an expensive place. But how can the place be cold with three (!) heaters in the room... central heating, extra heating and the electric fireplace? In (high season) May? I am so sorry to hear this, would have preferred to hear it at the first night of your stay so that I could help you with the heating... Again, sorry.  Merci Yohan, vous √™tes bienvenus. A la prochaine.  Thank you Katie Lee, most welcome next time!  Wonderful Andy, thank you. Such a lovely pleasure to see your little family evolve to something in the middle of experienced travellers & ideal guests. Most recommendable.  Thank you! You are most welcome next time:)  Thank you so much Samuel! :)  Lovely to meet you and thank you for staying with us. Thank you Heather, I totally respect your experience. For new guests I would like to stress out that a) The place is the ground floor of our house and we (nobody1) do not walk in the room. That is total privacy, with or without key. Your belongings are totally safe without exceptions. b) As for a quiet place: right in the sparkling city center of a center of 400 years out, we cannot guarantee that you won't hear us, we live in the same house. However, with double glass, the backside of the building, with great isolation and cooperative neighbors, you won't hear any city noises. However, it was a pleasure to host you and you are most welcome again. All the best!!!  Thank you, you are most welcome!  Wonderful, thank you so much. Was such a pleasure to host you.  Thank you:)  Thank you Monika & Axel!  Thank you!:)<br/> Thank you!  Thank you Katy.  I am so sorry to hear your comments. The kingsize bed is a  lit-jumeaux of 2,2 by 1,8 meter and bed cover of 2,4 by 2,4 meter. Sorry that is not king size for you but bigger beds and covers simply do not exist in Europe. The electrical outlets need a redo right away, I am sincerely sorry for that.  Thank you, you are most welcome!  Wonderful, thank you!!!  Sorry, our place is not so suitable for turning around day and night..  Thank you so much, such a pleasure to meet and to host you! Thank you Naam and Ori, our place is in the center... this is the center. Or do you mean the central train station... ? Thank you, you are most welcome. Such a pleasure to host you.  :) Thank you. Great to meet you.  Thank you Ceres. Literally a few steps...  7 restaurants within 200 meters. :)  Wonderful, you are most welcome... and you do not have to bring champagne all the time, it was a very nice surprise. Thank you.  Wonderful, it was a pleasure to host you. All the best, Corina Thank you BettyAnn. I loved the note you left behind. Most welcome again! PS If you need more space to spread out your luggage, just ask... easy solutions available.   Thank you!  Wonderful! Good to hear you enjoyed the stretch of the city... it is all walking distance. And yes, there is always something going on in Amsterdam... glad you love it!  Wow, thank you Anna what a wonderful evaluation/feedback. Thank you.  Thank you. Love the combination: front door city center buzz, back yard nice and calm.  Merci Kader! La meme a vous!  Dank Lisa. Hope to meet you next time.  Thank you, it was a pleasure to host you. Thank you so much. We hope to welcome you again. :)  Dear Pang, thank you for your wonderful evaluation. Be aware what you write, people might think you messed up the place but you only dropped a glass of water by accident. Things like that can happen. You are a wonderful person and a great guest, most welcome again and again.  Thank you Parisa, that is the concept of you having a great place in Amsterdam from now on. Best, Corina  Thank you Mandy!  Thank you.  Thank you Sue, most welcome!  Thank you so much! Very kind of you... I think you deserve at least a reward for being nice, kind and understanding plus for your independent way of traveling. Hope to see you next time. Best, Corina  Thank you !  Thank you so much Ori, you, your friend and your family are most welcome. Such a pleasure to meet you. Wishing you all the best!  Thank you dear Laura & John, you are most welcome!

Wonderful, your parents are great people traveling together in a very nice way.  Thank you so much Kristjan! Love your feedback! As about the internet: so sorry! If I reset the router, it works again for about three days but due to the festivities I forgot to do so. Sorry. However, I am done with the procedure and will solve the trouble with the best provider in the country (xs4all) they need to fix it. Good internet is crucial for contemporary travellers... Sorry.  Wonderful, thank you so much. You are most welcome!  Dear Caroline, thank you so much. It was a pleasure to welcome you in Europe and I wish you all the best. Love, Corina  Thank you Nancy, it was such a pleasure to meet you. All the best and hope to see you again.  Great review, thank you!!! It was a pleasure to meet you. All the best!

Thank you so much for your wonderful feedback. How about the walking distance to 9 straatjes... 50 meter. Anne Frank is 350 meter. I am glad you enjoyed our place, we love to welcome you again. All the best, Corina (and Emiel) Thank you Brian, it was a pleasure to meet you. All the best for you & yours, Corina  Thank you so much Lisa, great guest and a great review. Thank you.

So sweet, too much honor... thank you so much.  Thank you Dorianne, it was a pleasure to welcome you. <br/><br/>As for shampoo: sorry, it should be there! Apologies.  Thank you so much Alicia & Bella!  Thank you so much Ben & Barry, so sorry about Brexit. Always most welcome!  :) Wow, thank you Haim, for your wonderful recension! :)  Wow, and all that in the name of a very well reputed airbnb hostess herself. Thank you, great feedback. Best, Corina  xxx Thank you Maria, it took some time to get it translated, but certainly love your evaluation. Thank you.  Thank you so much wonderful couple!

Ai, I do not speak Italian....:s Thank you so much for your wonderful feedback Ilya and Galina. One question: you mean that within a 20 minute walk all the city highlights together can be reached as we live in the heart of the city? Wow, thank you Fethisha, you two are most welcome!!! Best, Corina  Dear Cem, no idea what you say... hope you had a good time in Amsterdam at our place while we were on holiday. All the best, Corina  Thank you Sinan! :)  Thank you Gonen. <br/>Correction on the shower: of course there is a door in the bathroom but the powershower is too powerfull without an extra door or curtain so that extra towels are provided for the floor. We will correct that soon. Thank you for your feedback.  Thank you Reut, next time please tell me face to face if you are not happy about one aspect or another so that we can sort things out. The pictures are from April 2014 and made by and approved by AirBnB. The too powerfull powershower comes with a cursu but also has a manual shower too that will not run all over the floor. And yes, Amsterdam city center is more expensive than the countryside there is nothing I can do on that.  Well, I look forward to see your Golan b&b appear soon. No hard feelings. Best, Corina  Thank you for your nice and constructive feedback. Welcome anytime! Best, Corina  Thank you Sandra, we look forward to welcome you again!  Thank you Eliran!<br/> Thank you Sally, anytime. <br/>All the best, <br/>Corina "

Wij hebben hier meerdere malen al over gebeld maar helaas zetten ze de pomp niet uit waardoor de sloot droog staat. Wij kunnen hier niets aan doen. <br/>Over de verlichting, dit vinden wij een goed punt en willen we in de toekomst veranderen Hoi Hannah,<br/>Bedankt voor je mooie recensie. Het was ook een genot om jullie te mogen ontvangen. <br/>Indien een gast vegan of vega is dan mogen zij dit aangeven en houden wij er rekening mee. <br/>Groetjes en wellicht tot in de toekomst. Hi Sarah,<br/>What a nice review, we alway love and enjoy it when our guests are as happy as you guys.. We hope to see you again and that we have many of guests who enjoy there stay as much as you did. This is why we have our B&B.. Experience the 'country life' just outside of Amsterdam and see the beauty. There is a busline that stops at our front door."

3204480,"Gary Salliere and his friends were not good guests. I will explain why; in Amsterdam a very strict policy applies to Airbnb accommodations. The most important rule in Amsterdam is that a maximum of 4 persons can stay in an accommodation; this means that not more than 4 persons are allowed to sleep, sit, hang out, have fun, you name it. Officers of the Amsterdam municipality are allowed to carry out checks in accommodations in Amsterdam and they do so regularly. If they do carry out a check and determine that more than 4 persons are present in the accommodation, the accommodation is irrevocably closed and the owner will receive a very high fine of at least 20,000 euros. For various reasons, the municipality of Amsterdam carries out these types of checks regularly and exactly for these reasons I have stated very clearly, and several times, on my accommodation page of Beagle Houseboat on AirBnB that you can stay with a maximum of 4 persons. When you browse the pages about Beagle Houseboat  and decide to book Beagle Houseboat with AirBnB, you actually have to explicitly agree that you understand and will abide by these rules. You would think that this would be clear but to make sure that people understand this really well, I also inform my guests, at check-in, that there should never be more than 4 persons on the ship. For the sake of completeness, and this is important, there is also a very LARGE information board at the entrance of the ship that clearly states, in 6 languages, ‚Äã‚Äãthat it is absolutely forbidden, illegal and not allowed to stay/hang out/sleep/smoke/whatever on Beagle Houseboat with more than 4 persons. <br/><br/>Gary Salliere and his friends booked for 4 persons for 4 nights. When I checked them in and after giving them the check-in tour on my Beagle Houseboat, I explicitly informed Gary Salliere  and his friends, again, that they can not bring, invite or allow other people onto the ship. They acknowledged explicitly that they were just a group of four and had no intention of breaking or violating this rule. <br/><br/>You would think that, as the owner of an AirBnB, you can trust people (one of the basic AirbnB principles) and that, with all these explicit warnings and requests, people will adhere to this rule.<br/><br/>Sadly, with Gary Salliere and his friends, it turned out to be absolutely not the case and I will explain what happened and why Gary Salliere and his friends are so extremely disappointing.<br/>When Gary Salliere and his friends arrived and during their check in, they asked if they could check-out a few hours later on Sunday, after their stay. Since I did not have a booking for Sunday, we agreed that Gary Salliere and his friends could check out on Sunday, their last day, at around 5 p.m. So they actually had a whole day on Sunday and they went into town in the morning. Quite by chance, pure coincidence, I actually saw on Sunday morning that Gary Salliere and his friends left the ship at around 10:00 in the morning‚Ä¶..with FIVE persons. I rubbed my eyes and looked again but it was very clear that he just left the ship with definitely FIVE persons.<br/>I was completely surprised and totally dumbfounded and because I clearly saw  that they left the ship with FIVE persons, I decided to consult and watch the recordings of the security cameras (which are located outside) to see if this person had been more often aboard and if so, when, and how often, this fifth person had been on board of the ship.<br/><br/>When I watched the recordings, it turned out and showed clearly that Gary Salliere and his friends had deliberately allowed to enter  a fifth person immediately (!!!) after checking them in upon their arrival  four days earlier, just after I left to go to work. This clearly demonstrates that Gary Salliere and his friends had planned in advance to mislead me and deliberately intended to stay with five persons on my boat. Furthermore, the video recordings clearly showed that this person had a suitcase with him and also slept on my boat ALL FOUR NIGHTS. Gary Salliere and his friends, therefore, very deliberately, during the check-in, heard and indicated that they would abide by the rules and then deliberately misled me by allowing a fifth person aboard almost immediately afterwards and allowing this person  for four nights on my boat to stay and sleep.<br/><br/>I find this extremely disappointing and I feel really misled. I really do not understand why people would want to mislead me in such a way and, with all the relevant  information and legal regulations provided, deliberately expose me, as the owner of an AirBnB accommodation on which I rely, to SERIOUS problems with the Amsterdam municipality.<br/><br/>In addition to the fact that this is really underhanded, childish, mean and unfair, Gary and his friends have deliberately endangered my AirBnB and completely ignored the possible consequences of their behaviour.<br/>For these reasons, I strongly advise against Gary Salliere and his friends as guests. They are unreliable, antisocial and unfair‚Ä¶<br/><br/><br/>Gary Salliere et ses amis n'√©taient pas de bons invit√©s. Je vais expliquer pourquoi; √† Amsterdam, une politique tr√®s stricte s‚Äôapplique aux h√©bergements Airbnb. La r√®gle la plus importante √† Amsterdam est qu'un maximum de 4 personnes puisse s√©journer dans un logement. cela signifie que pas plus de 4 personnes sont autoris√©es √† dormir, s'asseoir, se promener, s'amuser, nommez-le. Les agents de la commune d‚ÄôAmsterdam sont autoris√©s √† effectuer des contr√¥les dans les √©tablissements d‚Äôh√©bergement √† Amsterdam et ce, de mani√®re r√©guli√®re. S'ils effectuent un contr√¥le et d√©terminent que plus de 4 personnes sont pr√©sentes dans le logement, celui-ci est irr√©vocablement ferm√© et le propri√©taire se verra infliger une amende tr√®s √©lev√©e d'au moins 20 000 euros. Pour diverses raisons, la commune d‚ÄôAmsterdam effectue r√©guli√®rement ce type de contr√¥le, et c‚Äôest pr√©cis√©ment pour ces raisons que j‚Äôai d√©clar√© tr√®s clairement et √† plusieurs reprises sur ma page d‚Äôh√©bergement de Beagle Houseboat sur AirBnB que vous pouvez s√©journer au maximum √† 4 personnes. Lorsque vous parcourez les pages sur Beagle Houseboat et d√©cidez de r√©server Beagle Houseboat avec AirBnB, vous devez en fait explicitement accepter que vous comprenez et respecterez ces r√®gles. Vous penseriez que cela serait clair, mais pour que les gens le comprennent bien, j‚Äôinforme √©galement mes invit√©s, lors de l‚Äôenregistrement, qu‚Äôil ne devrait jamais y avoir plus de 4 personnes √† bord du navire. Par souci d'exhaustivit√©, et c'est important, il y a aussi un tr√®s grand panneau d'information √† l'entr√©e du navire qui indique clairement, en 6 langues, qu'il est absolument interdit, ill√©gal et interdit de rester / tra√Æner / dormir / fumer / quoi que ce soit sur Beagle Houseboat avec plus de 4 personnes.<br/><br/>Gary Salliere et ses amis ont r√©serv√© pour 4 personnes pour 4 nuits. Quand je les ai enregistr√©s et apr√®s leur avoir fait le tour d'enregistrement sur ma Beagle Houseboat, j'ai explicitement inform√© Gary Salliere et ses amis qu'ils ne pouvaient pas amener, inviter ou permettre √† d'autres personnes de monter √† bord du navire. Ils ont explicitement reconnu qu'ils n'√©taient qu'un groupe de quatre et n'avaient aucune intention de violer ou de violer cette r√®gle.<br/><br/>On pourrait penser qu‚Äôen tant que propri√©taire d‚Äôun AirBnB, vous pouvez faire confiance aux gens (l‚Äôun des principes de base d‚ÄôAirbnB) et que, avec tous ces avertissements et demandes explicites, les gens adh√©reront √† cette r√®gle.<br/><br/>Malheureusement, avec Gary Salliere et ses amis, il s'est av√©r√© que ce n'√©tait absolument pas le cas et j'expliquerai ce qui s'est pass√© et pourquoi Gary Salliere et ses amis sont extr√™mement d√©cevants.<br/>Quand Gary Salliere et ses amis sont arriv√©s et lors de leur enregistrement, ils ont demand√© s'ils pouvaient quitter quelques heures plus tard dimanche, apr√®s leur s√©jour. Comme je n'avais pas de r√©servation pour dimanche, nous avons convenu que Gary Salliere et ses amis pourraient partir le dimanche, leur dernier jour, vers 17 heures. Ils ont donc pass√© toute la journ√©e dimanche et sont all√©s en ville le matin. Tout √† fait par hasard, pure co√Øncidence, j‚Äôai effectivement vu dimanche matin que Gary Salliere et ses amis avaient quitt√© le navire vers 10 heures du matin‚Ä¶ avec cinq personnes. Je me suis frott√© les yeux et ai regard√© encore mais il √©tait tr√®s clair qu'il vient de quitter le navire avec d√©finitivement CINQ personnes.<br/>J'ai √©t√© compl√®tement surpris et totalement abasourdi et, comme j'ai clairement vu qu'ils ont quitt√© le navire avec CINQ personnes, j'ai d√©cid√© de consulter et de regarder les enregistrements des cam√©ras de s√©curit√© (situ√©es √† l'ext√©rieur) pour voir si cette personne avait √©t√© plus souvent √† bord et Si oui, quand et √† quelle fr√©quence cette cinqui√®me personne √©tait √† bord du navire.<br/><br/>Lorsque j‚Äôai regard√© les enregistrements, il est apparu clairement que Gary Salliere et ses amis avaient d√©lib√©r√©ment autoris√© l‚Äôentr√©e d‚Äôune cinqui√®me personne imm√©diatement (!!!) apr√®s les avoir enregistr√©es √† leur arriv√©e quatre jours plus t√¥t, juste apr√®s que je sois all√© √† travail. Cela montre clairement que Gary Salliere et ses amis avaient pr√©vu √† l‚Äôavance de me tromper et avaient l‚Äôintention d√©lib√©r√©e de rester avec cinq personnes √† bord de mon bateau. De plus, les enregistrements vid√©o montraient clairement que cette personne avait une valise avec elle et dormait √©galement sur mon bateau les quatre nuits. Gary Salliere et ses amis ont donc d√©lib√©r√©ment, lors de l'enregistrement, indiqu√© et entendu qu'ils allaient respecter les r√®gles, puis m'avoir d√©lib√©r√©ment induit en erreur en autorisant l'embarquement d'une cinqui√®me personne et en permettant √† cette personne de passer quatre nuits au m√™me moment. bateau pour rester et dormir.<br/><br/>Je trouve cela extr√™mement d√©cevant et je me sens vraiment induit en erreur. Je ne comprends vraiment pas pourquoi les gens voudraient m'induire en erreur de cette mani√®re et, avec toutes les informations pertinentes et les r√©glementations l√©gales fournies, m'exposent d√©lib√©r√©ment, en tant que propri√©taire d'un h√©bergement AirBnB sur lequel je compte, √† de s√©rieux probl√®mes avec Amsterdam municipalit√©.<br/><br/>En plus du fait que cela est vraiment sournois, enfantin, m√©chant et injuste, Gary et ses amis ont d√©lib√©r√©ment mis en danger mon AirBnB et ont totalement ignor√© les cons√©quences possibles de leur comportement.<br/>Pour ces raisons, je d√©conseille vivement √† Gary Salli√®re et √† ses amis d‚Äô√™tre invit√©s. Ils sont peu fiables, antisociaux et nonjuste... Guillermo and his friends were not good guests. <br/>Already on the first night they decided to ignore the most important houserule, which is ""Do NOT invite or bring other people to the ship"", <br/>which is exactly what they did; they invited several friends without even asking me or informing me.<br/><br/>Then on the third night, they again invited several people to the ship and even allowed them to sleep on the ship,  which I only found out the day after. <br/><br/>The worst part is that Guillermo actually communicated pretty well about most things (like arrival time, privacy of the room, weather in Amsterdam, etc) <br/>but deliberately choose not to ask me or inform me about his friends coming over and sleep on the ship.<br/><br/>Finally, the kitchen was left pretty dirty.<br/><br/>For these reasons, I can not recommend Guillermo as a guest. Sorry for the drips from the roof. It is now fixed"

I am a very flexible host and you can always store your luggage here after check out. you decided after booking to demand to stay longer in the room. I did what I could with new check in and cleaning and you gave me a poor rating on flexibility.. I hope other bookers understand and read house rules and understand how flexible I am. Thanks so much Kasja, It was a true pleasure to host you. See you next time here or in Sweden! thanks so much Mahogany, see you on your next visit muchas gracias  y nos vemos la proxima vez muchas gracias, hasta la proxima vez Muchas gracias, hasta la proxima vez Merci bien et nous verons a la prochaine fois Muchas gracias! nos vemos la proxima vez It was such a pleasure to host you, next time and when you are fit we go for a drink in town!

See you next time Thanks Wing for your feedback, size of bathroom and shower is mentioned in the advert, please read carefully before you book. I cannot make my house bigger ;-)<br/>You also mention noise on the street (it is downtown city centre Amsterdam, what do you expect?)<br/>you also mention no kitchen, no indeed you booked a room without a kitchen, actually in Amsterdam a B&B is not allowed to have a kitchen. <br/>If you did not understand my English when explaining the shower please ask or we can use Google translate. I now feel I get feedback that I cannot improve and I do not think it is fair feedback. To all my future guests. Please read the advertisement before you book I offer a great room in city centre of Amsterdam! Merci!! Grazie Mille!!! Muchisimo gracias!! Thanks so much. yes tiny and small streets, houses and rooms in Amsterdam ;-)  Dankeschon!!! Ich kann nie warten wann du beide wieder zur√ºck kommst :-) Thanks you are great guests! A true pleasure to host!! And thanks again for the chocolate yummy!!! See you next time  thanks for the review, thats why I put a map on the voucher, thanks for the tip<br/> Thanks so much, see you next time  Muchas Gracias!! Merci bien! a la prochaine!! Aloha!! See you in Hawaii! all the best with moving there Gracias!! Nos vemos!! Muchas Gracias!! Thanks for your comment. Actually the rooms are quite spacious for Amsterdam. 5 star hotels have more storage. Please read the description careful before your book. bed size rooms size is all there. Photos are exactly as the room is. Also you mention in private comment you had issues with entering the home. please specify. You will always have your own key and can enter anytime. I do not understand the issues you mention. Was it really about your stay in Amsterdam as I do not recognize myself or my listing in your review.  Merci bien pour cette review fantastique!!! merci —Å–ø–∞—Å–∏–±–æ (spasibo) :-) thanks so much, see you next time and yes will tell Veronica! Yes indeed. No kitchen. Amsterdam B&B's are not allowed to have a kitchen. I offer a kettle and coffee and tea. And upon request a cooling box. <br/>I you need a kitchen. Please book an apartment not a room. Thanks Samantha for pointing it out so I can inform future travelers.  Wow, thanks, very sweet. See you Down Under! amazing guests! highly recommended! Muchas gracias, nos vemos la proxima ves aqui o en Buenos Aires!! Muchas gracias!! Thanks, see you again here or in Boston!! Thanks, happy to host you again in the future Thanks for your response. In your private comments you mention you miss a TV in the room. I do not offer TV on purpose. So if you like a TV you book a room with a TV.<br/>Also you mention that i am not accurate with my size of the home/bed and amenities... I do not understand. I offer you for free use, tea, coffee a great breakfast for 2, towels 2pp, soap, shampoo, body wash, bathrobes, hairdryer free unlimited wifi. I cannot imagine anything else you miss for this price. If you look for a 5***** hotel you book a hotel like that. Airbnb is homestay and I think according to all my reviews I offer a great deal with 5star service though. I am disappointed in your review<br/>Matthijs Thank you, see you next time! Thanks Radzi, I updated my house information. See you soon again boys! Merci Aurore & Greg, a la prochaine!! Thank you for your review. Yes it was very cold outside. I am happy I offer hot water all day and have central heating so the room is warm in a few minutes when you keep the windows closed. I do notice you mentioned that the size of the house/room is small. That is something I mention I know and I cannot change and it is Amsterdam. All is tiny. But I have now a bad rating because you think the house is small but not because I sold you a big house and gave you a small house. I do not agree with your accuracy rating. Thank you Dominik & Daniela! see you next time! Toda Raba!! Thank you Belen & Rogers! You were great guests! Thank you for your kind words! yes yearly painting is done all looks fresh again :-) Thank you Charlie and Amy, hope to see you again! You were great guests Dankeschon. See you soon again!

Bis n√§chste Mal! thank you for your positive review, although you rated my accuracy low. I wonder what I can do to improve that. thanks again and thanks for the sweet gift Thank you Ewart, see you again! Dankeschon, bis nachste mal! Yes Robin, it was an early renovation.

Hasta la proxima vez thanks so much, see you again! thanks so much!!! It has been a true pleasure!! Thanks Kira for your review. The pictures are taken with a normal camera and I must say don't make the bathroom look bigger, I did not use a fish-eye lense). Everywhere in the description I mention the exact size of the bathroom (shower is 70x70cm, bathroom is 189x114cm) You picked this airbnb to stay in Amsterdam City Centre in my house. I cannot make the house bigger. everything in Amsterdam is tiny and petit. The price you do not only pay for the bathroom, also for location, services and hospitality, cleaning + airbnb service charge and tourist tax. Hotels with these services charge 200-250 euros a night. My advise to future bookers, please read the description better and if you like a big bathroom you book a 5star hotel :-) thanks so much, see you next time Grazie Mille! See you next time!!! thanks so much hope to see you again here or in NZ Thanks Bret, see you again! thanks cheryl, how is your leg? Hope it healed well Thanks Abbey and Sarah, hope to see you again in Amsterdam!! Thanks Margaret for your review, Yes the steep stairs are mentioned everywhere, 23 steps indeed, That makes the house so charming ;-) I must say the shower door opens both ways but you are right, might be small for some persons The shower itself is 70x70cm Thanks Erik and Molly! enjoy the rest of your stay in Holland thanks for this great review. I really appreciate it. Take care and enjoy traveling  Dankeschon, bis n√§chste mal!! Thanks Bonny! see you again!! Dankeschon!!! Bis nachste mal!! Wow!!! Thanks so much!

Dear  Khassim,<br/><br/>Thank you for staying. I hope you enjoyed your late check out.<br/>-In order to avoid noise from the center, I told you to close the black door (that makes it silent inside and makes a huge difference). Next to that, the handyman came over to repair the other door and now its works properly again, thnx for mentioning.<br/>-If you don't know how to use the heather, ask me next time, then I am happy to help you.<br/><br/>Have a pleasant day and see you next time Thanks, will do!

Feedback is always welcome - I always take it very seriously. I recommend in future you reach out to hosts during your stay as some items could be easy to fix. There are no bed bugs - maybe you were bitten by mosquitoes, there are sometimes some in Amsterdam. I could have given you advice if asked. The photos are accurate - please let me know where you had issues. You asked for a discount before you arrived which I gave you - Amsterdam is expensive these days. Of course your I respect your opinion and wish I could have done something about it at the time. With respect, I find the review entirely unfair - by far the worst I've had from 500+ reviews on my property. Very sorry to hear this from you Julia, I understand your frustration. I am frustrated too. I had messaged a couple of times during your stay but had no idea about these issues - new cleaner - my responsibility. Feedback is always welcome. I suggest to report these issues to a host immediately so they can do something about it eg send a different cleaner, provide fresh linen. Shampoo & shower gel is provided. The listing does mention I live here and there are storage spaces indicated for guests in every room. Sorry again for the cleanliness issues - I have taken appropriate steps. Thank you for your feedback Brian, it is most welcome. Please let hosts know as soon as you discover an issue, so we can address it immediately. I'm sorry you needed to change the sheets, I would gladly do that for you next time! The issue has now been dealt with so there will be no repeat. Thanks again for taking the time to leave a thorough review. Hope you had a great stay. All the best"

We informed you specifically on our no noize policy as we are situated in a family neighborhood. When we receive complaints from 3 different neighbors in the morning who woke up at night because of you, we had no choice than to ask you to find a different place to stay, that would better suit your needs. <br/><br/>Concerning hygiene, you are the first to have ever complaint about this as we have a strict, extensive cleaning scheme, so we are sorry if you were not happy with this.<br/><br/>Kind regards<br/>Jelleke, owner of Kith & Kin Thank you, we are happy to hear you enjoyed staying with us.

3498674,"Thanks for taking the time to write your detailed feedback. I will take some points by heart: I will create some more room in the bathroom for personal stuff of my guests. I added in my description that our tap water is one of the cleanest tap waters in the world, and that we therefore don't provide any bottled water as sustainability is also important to us.  I will speak to my cleaner about the cupboards. I wasn't aware of this issue.  It's a pity this only came up in the review after you left as I could have immediately adjusted these things for you, making your stay in Amsterdam more comfortable. I hope you nonetheless have good memories of Amsterdam. Thank you for your kind words, Sergio. You and Selma were great guests. I wish lots of happy times for you and Selma in your new house and in your new city! Thank you for your great review! You and your friend were such nice guests! However, I have a small correction :-) I don't live with my mother. My mom happened to be visiting when you arrived. Hence the misunderstanding. But she lives elsewhere :-). Thanks again for staying with us and I hope you had a good trip back to Russia! Thanks for your kind review, Irmak. I enjoyed hosting you and Berkay. You were good and friendly people and I love to host people like you.  Safe travels! Thanks for your review, Rian. Embarassingly enough, the guest wifi didn't work because of a loose cable. This problem is fixed now. Happy travels! Yeah, I didn't think about the fact that you were leaving the next day when we were talking :-) Thanks for the lovely words.

I initially thought flowers were plastic until I saw the water!  <br/>Space:  Very roomy for two people.  Comfortable bed, just like home. Sufficient hangers for the roomy closet.<br/>Cleanliness:  Like new.<br/>Local tips: Karel knows the city.  We needed a EU SIM card; she recommended area close by that had many places selling SIM cards.  We found a SIM suiting our needs.  We're chocoholics, so she recommended a nearby chocolate shop.  Wow, (just like Karel's place), we'll put that shop on our A-plus list!  No kidding,  better than Bruges! Wow, wat een mooie recensie!! Erg blij mee. Dankjewel Pieter!"

3552086,"Thanks for the good review, Moritz, much appreciated! It was great to host you. Just to clarify for future travelers: our place is directly in the city center - the red light district and central station are indeed some 15-20 mins walking away, but we are on the southwest part of the center that includes the historic canal belt, Anne Frank, Jordaan and Leidseplein. Best, Dennie Hi Sebastian - thanks again for staying with us, and glad to hear you had a good time and liked staying with us. We did notice you indicated on the review that the small size of our room had slightly disappointed you. Whilst our advertisement calls out the exact size of both the room and the bed, we are ofcourse sorry to hear that; but glad it didn‚Äôt impact your stay too much. Best, Elske & Dennie Hi Rickey - glad to hear you enjoyed your time with us and in Amsterdam overall. <br/>Thanks for your clear feedback that there was some confusion on whether the kitchen in the private part of our home is considered communal space. Whilst the advertisement states only the room, bathroom and toilet are spaces available to our guests - we'll make sure going forward we explicitly mention there is no kitchen or communal space. <br/>We were very happy to host you (and the guest you introduced after booking with us), and wish you all the best.  Dankjewel Phaedra voor de mooie woorden! Jullie zijn van harte welkom - tot een volgende keer! Vielen Dank Karina f√ºr Ihre freundlichen Worte! Wir m√∂chten es auch gerne genauso wieder tun!"

Desir√©e shared  with me the Dolche de Leche  that  you  brought as a present, it was delicious! Thanks for  your nice guesture.   Hi Sylvie , Thanks for your comment.  I remember there was a   Beach vollyeball tournament in the city and therefore a lot of  partynoise from  Damsquare  and Nieuwmarkt. I am sorry for that. <br/>About  the price: I realize that  many  hosts  in France don't have  to follow certain gouvernmental rules,  like we  have in Amsterdam. we are not allowed not rent our place  if we are not registrated officially. Most rooms in  the neighborhood have higher prices and  Airbnb 's price indicator gives also a much higher price  than I ask. I  think my price is reasonable because  this is not black money and therefore  I have to pay:3% Airbnb service costs,  6% VAT and  36% income taxes. I realize that Airbnb  charges  you 12% servicecosts and 5% Tourist tax,   that's why the price is  so high! I'm sorry for that!  <br/>Thanks for being  my guest . Thanks for your nice review Prakash! Because most guests are  out during the day  and I am away to my studio,  I schedueled the central heating so that it is off between 10 am and 6 pm to save energy. However, on request I can make a different scedule, as I did for Prakash, who had homework to do that day.  I'm glad that he asked and the cold  could be taken away. Thanks  for appreciating  the bathrobe and slippers! It is a new service  that I offer and I am glad  that it is appreciated.  Hi Giulia, I'm sorry that you didn't use the electric heater in the bathroom. I should have explained that to you!  Thanks, Gina, it was very nice to have you both as my guests! Merci pour vos commentaires gentils! C'√©tait un vrai bonheur de vous accommoder.<br/>Bien venue quand vous voulez visiter Amsterdam une autre vois. Thanks  for the lovely review!

Dear Ashley, many thanks for booking my apartment and happy to hear you enjoyed your stay. Thanks for your feedback on the listing. First time that a guest mentioned that it‚Äôs written that there is 1,5 bathroom. Have no idea where to find and change that text. I did not write that myself in the add so it‚Äôs a bit of a mystery for me how it got there. I will contact Airbnb so hopefully they can help me with this. Enjoy the rest of Europe! Best regards, Sheryl Thank you so much for your positive feedback! Welcome back any time. Dear Ravindra, thanks for your feedback.

Welcome back anytime :-) Hi Genuo, I cannot read your feedback but hopefully you are satisfied? Thanks for booking with us! Thanks so much For your feedback and For booking with us!! Anne wrote a bad review about us because something went wrong with the keys. It was completely my falt and like always with Murphey's law I could not communicate with Anne because I was at an opening of a restaurant I designed in Utrecht (far from our apartment) and The battery of my phone was dead. I apologized sincerely and offered immediately to pay for The hotel that Anne and her family needed to book for The first night. The next day my boyfriend left The keys in a restaurant near to our apartment but unfortunately The person behind The bar that he gave it to left before Anne and her family came and we had to call few times before Somebody else could find it. Again... Very bad luck but no bad intentions from our side. <br/><br/>It took around half an hour but because Anne and her huisband were with their small child and we have a two Year old ourselves we can immagine it was a very stressfull situation for them. That is why we immediately let them know that they would get a 100% refund so we gave all The money that we received back The next day. <br/><br/>We are experienced hosts on Airbnb with Many Many satisfied guests - Some with baby's - and this was The very first (and last) time it happened. Especially families with kids are more than welcome and usually we do all check in's personally whenever we are able to. Thanks for your possitive feedback Erik. And many thanks for leaving our appartment as clean as you found it. Good to hear you had a great time and maybe till next time. All the best, Gaby & Sheryl"
3607736,"I'm sorry to hear this feedback. I must say I don't recognize the cleanliness part. The day before, everything has been cleaned thoroughly, including the toilet of course. The linen was washed the day before and put on fresh in the morning of the arrival.<br/>About the bikes is true, I'm sorry about that. One had a flat tyre, the other one was in front of the apartment building, but of course it's possible that Alessandra couldn't find it. That's on me. I'll  make sure that my next guests have the availability. Thanks for staying, Hande. It was a (Turkish) delight having you over :-) Thanks for the feedback, Peter! All the best for the new year for you and your family. Thanks Isabelle! Hope to see you another time. Thanks for your review, Nebo!

3694185,"After 10 years of being an Airbnb host with 37 reviews of 5 stars, and three 4 star reviews, it‚Äôs never nice when somebody gives you a 3 star review‚Ä¶ Especially not when you read things who are not true.

When someone texts you ‚Äúshow my WhatsApp picture in the grocery shop, then you will get the keys (they don‚Äôt speak English)‚Äù, starting a conversation in English is maybe not the best idea‚Ä¶<br/>2.

3703205,"I'm really sorry you were not able to enjoy your stay. There must have been a misunderstanding: this is not a hotel, or a holiday home; this is my house and the things that I use in everyday life are the things you can use during your stay. I understand most people are very happy with that.<br/>More to the point: <br/>- I have one easy chair, but also an easy couch, which sits 2. <br/>- I myself prefer rough towels (they're not cheap). <br/>- I'll look if something needs to be done about the sheets, for future guests. <br/>- It is stated verbatim on the listing that there is a TV with Chromecast, not cable television. <br/>I wish you all the best, and hope your next experience with Airbnb will be a better one. Thank you!<br/>It was a pleasure hosting you! You‚Äôre always welcome here! A pity we didn‚Äôt meet in person. Thank you, Zeynep. It was a pleasure having you. Good luck to you and your friends! I'm happy you had such a good time here! Thank you for the wonderful review! Sorry about the fridge. A pity you didn't tell me, so I could have cleared some more space.<br/>About check-out: I told you the other guests would be there by 17:00. You came back only at 17:00 while the living room was still a big mess (tobacco, cigarette butts, rolling paper, beer cans everywhere). I did not put your bags on the sidewalk, but collected them in the living room. <br/>It's a good thing most Airbnb guests have more respect for my property."

3732811,"Thank you Jessica, you and yours where great guests!"
3775786,"Well, just a small rectification.... The stairs to the sleepingrooms are normal stairs and its certainly not a ladder (???). And about the stairs to the apartment: every apartment in Amsterdam is with stairs and these are more broad then others because the building used to be a factory. But there is no elevator, so the place is not suitable for less mobile people, thats true. Well, just a small correction here... It's hard to get more central then this. Haha, great 'love action'....  Location probably.."
3788198,"Such a great couple, left my place perfect. Carsten, I'm shocked to read this review...my place is my own personal place and not a professional airbnb, like Airbnb was intended...My apartment is ALWAYS prepared in EXACTLY the same way for all my guests, and I get good reviews. <br/><br/>Since you didn't warn me during or after your stay, Im not sure what to  make better.<br/>And as you were first time airbnb users, I would suggest  you book a hotel next time. I have recognized the smoke smell as complaints from more guests and have taken action to avoid this, my sincere apology"
3788673,"Hi David,<br/>so sorry to hear about your reaction. In the 10 years we rent out the apartment we never had this kind of review. We rent out the apartment and nobody lives here in between stays. Also we have a lot of good reviews on cleaning as we think this is important.<br/>I must say that it was also not easy communicating with you as you were not reading and responding to our Airbnb messages. It's also a bit unfair writing a a review with complaints you did not inform us about during your stay. If something would be not according to expectations we would have fixed it.<br/>Nevertheless, thanks for staying and enjoy your next Airbnb stay.<br/>Kind regards,<br/>Laurens"

3877342,"The stairs are Dutch. Not big but definitely not spiral. We brought all the luggage downstairs, early check in and the guest never confirmed he was coming with more people which he did not confirm or book. Did not want to pay the extra money. Once in a 1000 visits you have guests you cannot please. Apparently this was the person not to please.  Very sorry. The dryer is working. I was a text away for any help needed. I have 3 toilets and all pictures are the way it is. Sometimes people tell me it is better than the pictures. <br/>Sorry it was such a bad experience for you. <br/>I wish it would have been different. You asked for a X mas tree and I provided a huge beautiful one for you. I did not give a discount during this high season that is correct. In the hallway is the cupboard for the jackets. The rituals toiletries line are for all guests in the bathroom to use. Only 1 bedrooms has personal items in the cupboard but does have 2 complete empty cupboards as well that can hold at least 2 suitcases. One of the 2 cupboards in the bathroom is empty for guests and it can hold your bag easily? I will make a guide for the oven/ washer good tip. Yes I do live in this houseboat and normally people love it like it is in the pictures.  I try to be the best host I can be  and even being a super host for years I cannot please everyone which is unfortunate. You arrived early in the morning way before check in time. And I had friends over. After your checkin no other people then yourself so no sorry what you mean with people in and out the unit. Suprised since my guests always like the peace and quietness here. <br/>I think only the guy window cleaner guy stopped by for his quarterly round. Dear Cedric, it is a shame you did not respond on my first short message. Right after your booking months ago. If you knew that you booked a room and not the complete houseboat. Shame you did not respond to any of my messages actually. <br/>Also it is a beautiful hotel like room.  Houseboat with 2 layers have smaller windows downstairs because part of the boat is under water. <br/>I am here. Just me and not a family that is it. I find it a shame you write a review without seeing my place. Does not feel fair. Snuggly is totally not what my other guests experience here. Space, luxurious and all exactly like the pictures or better. Thanks for your stay! If I would have known. You can turn the ventilation off. There is a knob in the bathroom. You only use it while you shower. Thank you that you recommend my beautiful houseboat. Only I think you mix up your bookings since there is no cat hair, a cat or a cat toilet at this houseboat...<br/>See you soon! Sorry to hear it was too cool downstairs. We like it like that but there is floor heating so warmer is always possible! <br/>I think you thought you smelled cats food but my partner has a Chinese herbs proces. Which is not really a nice fragrance when he cooks the herbs. He has a few weeks to go then everything is back to normal. The shower is indeed in the room like you see on the pictures. <br/>For the city you can always take the bikes as well. You are right it was a very bad timing. There was a power issue with the kabels in the street. That is why to the toilet did not grind either as well. Because it was raining so hard we had to wait untill it was dry so they could work on the electricity. Rare thing and normally is not something you had to face. Sorry if it disrupted your holiday in any possibel way. Always welcome back and I make sure you have the best stay ever!  Thank you for visiting!<br/> I am sorry for the noise this is normally such a quiet place. We had a exceptional large fotoshoot with so many people so yes noisy. This is normally never something that happens."
3879155,"Elsa maybe you should be a little more honest in your review. First of all I offered you the opportunity to bring your suitcase early in the morning while I still had other guests, checkin is after 2 o'clock, when they left you went to hang around in a notoriously unclean room and then after I asked if you wanted to come back after 2 o'clock you were extensively in my not yet cleaned kitchen. <br/><br/>Then I hear you coughing gigantically in the kitchen and when I ask which one of you is sick the answer is no, it's nothing serious, I did a test. <br/>So regardless of the fact that I did contract covid for the first time in 2 years, thank you for that, could you have had the decency after getting on a plane ""sick"" to check with your host if he or she would have a problem with you being sick.  Sorry but this is flat out rude, you don't think about the fact that you could make someone else sick and that other person, me in this case will receive other people in the house afterwards.<br/><br/>I consulted with airbnb afterwards because I found it very annoying as I had had surgery not long before and was therefore vulnerable, but also didn't want to just put you out on the street and asked what to do with this. <br/><br/>I have agreed to let you stay but with appropriate distance.  The explanation of things in the house was therefore not given, and I also indicated that I did not have time before the check-in time of 2 hours.<br/><br/>I try to help everyone to feel comfortable at all times and everyone is welcome in my house, I may at least expect someone to be a little respectful to others, after reading your review I can only think, I should have accepted the offer of airbnb to find you another accommodation. I have been sick for 2 weeks, the covid has passed, the bitter aftertaste stays. Hi Melissa I've mentioned that I painted on little wall and a door that was scrachted by suitcases not the whole room ..kitchen and bathroom where in my perspective fine but  will give it some more attention next coming days without  guests . My advertisement and me are saying my living room is private and not for common use. I will update new photos soon thanks for your feedback Hi Jill, I wished you would have told me there where to many rules. Most of my basic houserules are in my listing already. Asking my guests to be gentle to my walls and not hit their suitcase to them, getting some fresh air in in the morning and closing doors gently instead of slamming seems fair enough for me. If you didn't get lost and got there after a long wait I've could have done the check-in with you would have explained some off the guidelines ...instead of thinking of it like stricked rules. The only time the kitchen was messy was just after cooking dinner for a friend,  other times I finished my dinner I always made sure there was space for you to cook. Pans on the stove where washed not dirty. and concerning  my living that is my private space and no judgement needed for that . Since this is not a common space. Sorry you feel that way that kitchen wasn't good enough for you but I could have not clean up more then I already did. I'll be glad to host you again Brian ! Thank you Hi Emma ,<br/>There where some issues with the windows but that is unfortunately out of my hands the management company for owners will come up with a solution soon. They know it's important for me. Doing the best I can to fix stuff on the spot straight away. My house is from 1936 and things I'm working on is to make it nicer for myself and of course for my guests without bothering them to much with it. renovation is finished and you are right about the pictures of the room. For me the room feels like an upgrade but already reached out to a photographer..just waiting for some sunny day. <br/>unfortunately I did not have written you a review and I prefer not to complain about my guests, during the stay it was all fine. Except using my not cheap but fragile mirror on the wall as a clothes hanger. with the danger that it would fall of the wall?  I have hooks and when you needed more you should have asked :(  Getting home very late knowing you had to leave very early the next morning almost didn't catch your flight and leaving the room in total chaos, tabacco, paper...empty boxes..condoms..<br/>garbage everywhere...soaked towels on the sheets. it took me twice as long to clean.... You guys left it like a pigsty. Hearing from you it was a bit messy is a bit hard to put that in perspective,with the feeling you had total lack of being respectful to my stuff and towards me, to settle me up with all your garbage. My hallway was maybe bit messy with some working tools and the wall in the room..sorry for that. Sorry Velimir but you are the similar length as I am, 1.74 and there is warm water there is nothing broken in the bathroom, you could have asked how a thermostat tab is working I've could have explained it to you You are always welcome ! Ningxin, thank you for your feedback. As we speek i'm doing the last preperations for going enviroment friendly. I got an approval for this, so my heatingsystem will be totally replaced for another system, guests can also regulate their own heat :) thanks again. Cheers Sjoukje Hey I had to google translate but thank you :) You are welcome ! Thank you so much !!  Thank you Amanda and Naz says Hi !!!  Hhahahaha thanks Liam, sorry for not writing you a review ! You are welcome anytime !! :)  Hi Daniel thank you so much....hope you had a good europe trip....15-20 to downtown by foot you mean ;)  Thank you Bobby !  Thank you Lovey it was nice having you around !!!  I told you by the checkin and also it is in my house rules not to use the shower after midnight cause that will wake me up. Lying sick in bed and not respecting the only thing I told you twice and that waking me up at 4:30 in the morning was very unrespectfull. It was not by accident but just being unrespectfull. Sorry Riikkaa i'm very easy going but your friend was totally drunk.  Thank you Andis for your nice review !  Owwww Mario, I was to late to write you a review so sorry ! Thank you so much !!! Hope to see you again  Hi Ana,<br/>unfortunately rooms in Amsterdam aren't that big, that's why i have a closet you can put your stuff in, if the suitcase was in the way you could have asked me to put it in the closed basement for you ;) <br/>In your private comment you are talking about a carpet, as far is I know there's no carpet in your room. Only a wooden floor, there might be some stains in there that former guests created and it's withdrawn in the wood :( Hi Leanne, first of all it's a bit hard to reply on something that's been written in a language which is not easy to translate to English or Dutch.  The only thing I can read is that you where a bit upset by my comment of making instant noodles and spring unions at 7 in the morning. I will adjust it in my profile. When you travel I can imagine that you wake up early to get the most of the day. For me it's not travel and go to bed a bit later then most of my guests. I try to keep it quite during your rest  and hope that my guests have the same standards in the morning to give me my rest. It was cooking, using hairdryer with an open door and a lot of rumors at 7 in the morning that got my out of my sleep. Sorry for the misunderstanding. Hi Sarah sorry you didn't had the experience what you where expecting. I told your boyfriend the reason of not being in normal mode like always since we just got some bad news at work. That's the reason i'm pulling back at that time. Also it where the first very warm days of the year and  garbage containers where full  full, told you that and i'm sorry for that but not allowed to put it on the street we have to put it in the containers. My door is always locked except when i'm at home. There's no reason to lock it when i'm in the house. It might be your perception I was home lying on the couch or in bed the whole day but looking at my agenda I had a quite busy week outside ;) sorry you did not have the experience even with a lot of discount I gave you. Maybe beter luck in a hostel the next time :) Hey Clement, sorry for not having enough time to write you a public review !!! Really had a nice time hosting you...and really don't worry about the waking up thing.....glad it wasn't serious that you had to brake of your holiday :) I definitely will go to Paris someday and will give you a call so we can hang out !!! Loved the Bonbons !!! There the best !!!! Thanks for the tip about neighborhood pictures..will do :)  Thank you Kaman.....once again sorry for waking you up :) Thank you Alberto, it was so nice hosting you...full of energy and cheerful, Naz loved you guys as well !!! Thank you again for your present. Really enjoyed it :)   Hi Eden thanks for the feedback that it disturb you that there was no lock for the bathroom door. Nobody ever seemed to have a problem with it i was struggling what kind of solution I could create but since nobody talked about it I thought it was ok for now ! Lucky for you we where gone a couple of days and you had the place for yourself :) LOCK PROBLEM IS FIXED I have a lock now....I don't want people to feel unpleasant about staying here...so if you come back you can lock the door :) Thank you Annie for your nice review !!! Thank you for your nice review Thank you sweetheart was nice hosting you :) Hi Matt thank you so much !! And thanks again for the stuff you brought me from the states :)  Thank you Friederike it was nice hosting you :)  Thank you Gerald ! Hope you had a good stay in Amsterdam :) Hi Erica, thank you for your review, hope you had a good stay !  Hi Anders, first of all, starting your review with host won't get in your way ?  That sounds a bit negative don't you think ? First of all i'm renting out a room in the house I live...You guys woke me up couple of times running of to the toilet in the morning cause of hangover and also by coming home in the middle of the night loud talking and not respecting that i was sleeping? Second of all you are the first in all those years that's complaining about cat smell....And trust me I hosted enough people to know if that its a fact that it's not smelling of cat..you are complaining about nothing....the room didn't smell nice after you guys have left and also the sheets (brand new) I had to wash 2 times before they got clean again. Also your friend going to the bathroom before leaving didn't smell nice...So I think the feeling is mutual. I told you when you came in I did not had the time to do  the kitchen before you came and like you said it was clean the next day so whats the problem to complain about it....i'm redecorating also the kitchen and like i told you i'm having guest of and I asked the construction market for paint that won't smell...I couldn't wait for the new guests since I only had a couple of days of and want people to sleep in a nice room ! Next time you should book an expensive hotel where they don't have cat's and where you can't keep people awake and people won't be in your way !  Like I said before feeling is unfortunately mutual.... Hi Sabina, thank you so much for your review, sorry about the kitchen, sometimes I have to cook myself and when i'm working i might not clean it up right away sorry for that. Hope you had a good stay after all :) Hi Troels, thank you for your kind words !! Welcome anytime !  Hi Sergey, thank you so much for your review and sorry for not being in time writing a nice one for you !!! You where nice guests ! Thank you  Hi Maria, i'm sorry that you felt like room and bathroom weren't very clean. I try to do my best and was little bit upset my cleaninglady doesn't do what i expect her to do :( Hope you had a good stay overall.... Thank you so much for giving him lot's of hugs....he loved you guys so much he did not even want to sleep in my bed when I got home after the trip !!! Come back when ever you want ! You are more then welcome !! Thank you so much Tom and Shannon !!!! Hope you have a great Europe Trip and lots of sun....Naz is missing your Belly Rubs :)  Hi Giovanni, sorry for the bathroom I clean it everyday but it's an old house so it might not look clean and Naz also loves to play in there :( Hope you had a good stay overall.  Hi Natalie, sorry it was not as tidy and clean as you expected. We cleaned the house with the 2 off us and still wondering what could we could have done more since we had to wait for you to arrive and already running late for our day off. I was having a couple of days off with my friend from Spain and we did all the best to clean your bedroom as good as possible and keep up with the bathroom. Kitchen well is also live and cook sorry for that..:( Hi Sweetheart,<br/>Thank you for your review...hope it turned out good for you at the and. Sorry for not having any space to get you through the waiting days ! Hugs Sjoukje  Thank you Jessica...just of couple of weeks....then i'm starting the program to stop smoking :)  Hi Margit....sorry that you didn't feel welcome when you arrived...did not forget but also told you monday is sunday and then I sleep inn...morning time is not my brightest moment of the day....I want to be flexible with checkin times what can mean I have to stay up or need to get up early..but once again sorry for not feeling welcome in the beginning....and also sorry for the mixup with smoking...I'm learning from that I have to inform guests up front if it's a problem to smoke in my livingroom....normally the cleaning lady is coming but it was her holiday and got sick afterwards....and it's also for making sure you have clean sheet and towels. I try to keep it as clean as possible but it's an old house..you should have talked to me about it when you where here :( <br/> Hi Juliet,<br/>Thank you for your review....the pleasure was all mine hosting you guys...you are both very warm and nice....! Hope to see you again.<br/><br/>Cheers Sjoukje  Come back in the summer Alex !!! Really had a nice time hosting you guys !!!

And thank you so much looking after Naz !!!  Thanks Julie, had a good time hosting you !! Thanks Matt !! Hope you are having a good interrail trip with your girl !!! And that the weather is getting beter in Croatia !!!  Hi Brigitte, thank you for your review<br/>Cleaningcost are more for all the other costs i'm having to host people.... :) I think it's more fair to charge one price for 15 euro's in stead of putting the price per night up :) about the living room I always say to my guest feel free to hop in in the living room and offcourse to have breakfast or some dinner, but it's also my working/living space and sometimes I just have to adjust ;) hope you understand that....hope you had a good time after all.... Hi Holly sorry to hear, I told you that something went wrong with my email I send you the day before with instructions how to get into my place since my neighbor wasn't back from a holiday yet. Your writing it now if as your room wasn't clean and I can tell for sure it was...about livingroom, i just got back from my holiday....and with bathroom light i'm sorry it broke down the minute you guys came in and told you that I had problems fixing it. Your friend was telling me it wasn't a problem....I didn't had any friends over I left that night to leave you guys alone and have a decent sleep....i'm sorry for the phonecall in the middle of the night and that i didn't put my phone on the buzz...... Hi Sophie.....good to hear that you had a good time and sorry that I didn't had the chance to meet you guys.....!!! And thanks again for cat sitting......I figured out how the little monster got on the balcony......so really not to worry about that ;)  Hi John good to hear !!! Hope you will find a place for yourself pretty soon and enjoy to full dutchie life !!! Hope everything is good on the job !!! Really sorry to hear that you didn't had a good time....told you that guest just left and that the sheets where drying outside...since I try to do all the best for my guests not being to strictly about checkin en checkout times....and they can sleep in if they want...try that at a hostel for this price...I've put up enough hangers where you can put your wet towels on and it's not even a problem to put them in the bathtub the next day and get fresh ones if you want to....just ask...I try to do the best with the space I have in the apartment and asking can fix a lot of things....telling me afterwards and complain with a bad review not...that's a shame....cause I really like it that my guests will have a good stay as you can read on the other reviews ! Hope the next time you go to Amsterdam you will find a Hostel for a decent price that will suit you  Belisa !!! Had a good time with you an your ant too.....hope you had a good trip down Europe !!! Really hope meeting up with you guys sometime in Brasil......x"
3970753,"Hi Kimbery,<br/><br/>Sorry to hear that your husband felt this way.<br/>We are really surprised by this since we always do the check-in the same way.<br/><br/>About your comments:<br/>1) We used to have a lock (and have our own a spare key like any hotel) but regulations by the municipality don't allow that anymore.<br/>2) We tell guests that it is an old house and that we sleep below the bedroom so we ask them to keep any noise in the living room.<br/>3) It is a non smoking apartment so we ask our guests to smoke outside and not directly in front of the house. We can't ask people walking by :) Hi Toby,<br/><br/>Thanks for your nice words.<br/>Two things:<br/>- We gave you 2 sets of keys as we always do<br/>- There is a range extender for the bedroom wifi that needed to be reset<br/><br/>Thanks again!<br/>Eline & Take"

4012448,"Thank you Robin for your positive review. It was a pleasure to have. The google translation from French to English is wrong. It should say person (host) available (to support and answer questions) üòä You are welcome! Thank you for the review. Hope you are enjoying your time with your family. Happy that you enjoyed your stay in Amsterdam. Thank you for the review. You're welcome Anna, it was a pleasure."
4013546,"Information correction: in the weekend (Friday - Sunday) there is night bus between central station and our building. Unfortunately, the cleaning was not always optimal this summer due to circumstances. Ventilation has my constant attention, but I also depend on my guests for this. The room is decorated neutrally, I don't understand what can hurt the eyes. Iago was a kind guy and we had really nice conversations.<br/>It seems that Iago didn't read my listing well. It's clearly mentioned in my listing of renting a private room. All the pics on my listing are exactly the same as the reality. Smoking only allowed at the balcony is mentioned too in the listing. <br/>Pity that Iago didn't tell me this during his stay. Feel sorry that I didn't get the chance to help him to make his visit even more enjoyable. My apartment has two bedrooms, both to rent during my absence. It's possible that another bedroom has been taken by your booking, sometimes not, in this case the whole apartment is yours. No one guest before complained the cleanness, in contrast, the cleanness has been highly rewarded. Concerning to the shower you should not to turn it higher than 45 degrees to avoid the fire of the geyser from switching out automatically due to protection of itself. This is to read from the house guidance. <br/>It's my wish and pleasure to bring every guest the best and make you happy. Clearly Greg had some different ideas and expections about airbnb.<br/><br/>Some matters at home can always happen as any family, such as the bathtub.<br/>The shower system has protection by itsself, the fire could turn off automatically once it's getting too hot (around 45 degress). by safety reason.<br/>It's possible that the another bedroom is taken by someone else at my absence (I was not at home during Greg's stay) as by airbnb you rent one bedroom, not the whole apartment in general.<br/><br/>Despite those I still feel sorry for Greg. I do hope Greg enjoyed Amsterdam. Thanks Jordan for sharing your thoughts openly and honestly. <br/>It happened that guests brought damages by ironing. Fortunately I discovered it in time. Otherwise it could become a big probem even a disaster. That's why when I'm not at home during guest's stay(dur to my work I'm often in abroad), there will be no ironing provided to avoid the danger from happening, just for safety reason.<br/>Sorry Joran, if there was misunderstanding or it was unclear. In my listing it's written my apartment is in a quiet and green residential area for a good rest after a busy tourist day. It's 4 minutes bus plus 3 minutes metro to Amsterdam central station where is the absolute center. There is floor heating in the bathroom. The queen size bed is with two separate mattresses. Oscar got 40% discount, sadly he had unrealistic high demanding. After check-out, he told certain negative things, I explained and clarified to him with patience and facts. Unfortunately he totally ignored my efforts, continued expressing it in a threatening way. I sensed what Oscar really tried and refused to give what he wanted. It just felt not right to pay someone for high rating in return.  Sorry, Oscar. It's a pity that Donnie didn't share his concerns with me directly, as it's a misunderstanding. As mentioned on my listing: by payment I can wash the clothes for guest, guest is not allowed to use the washing machine by themselves due to two times broken by guests. I always told guests that mutual trust is the most important thing to me. It's my home, therefore I need to go home for my posts, giving plans water, getting fresh air in rooms when necessary etc. If a guest doesn't have trust in me, you can beter not to book the private rooms at my apartment. Hopefully Donnie still enjoyed his stay. Regrettably that Gautam felt the apartment too expensive and with too many restrictions. Unfortunately Amsterdam is an expensive city, my apartment is reasonably priced, even cheap in comparison with most Airbnbs in Amsterdam. To keep surroundings and environment nice, we need certain regulations so that everyone can benefit and enjoy the life most. I feel its really difficult to satisfy the needs of most guests from India, probably due to cultural differences? When 90% guests are satisfied and happy with my apartment, I feel I've done it good and right. It's really upset that a very few guests who have unrealistic requirements, with unlawful intention, wrote down untrue things. In Hannah her case, just because she didn't get refunding (following Airbnb policy) as she got a free place to stay. I do hope Hannah had enjoyed Amsterdam with her friend. I must say her friend DongPei is a very nice guest. Thanks DongPei. Eva is friendly and showed her respect to the house rules. Unfortunately there were clearly misunderstandings. The booking was for a PRIVATE ROOM, not the entire apartment, which means the living room (40 m2) is accessible for guest, but not used as the basic area for guest. You can shower as long as you like, just good to know that the hot-water geyser could switch out automatically to protect itself, when the geyser gets too hot, to avoid safety issue.<br/>Due to the current energy situation in Europe, it's common in The Netherlands that most households limit the use of energy as otherwise simply impossible to pay the energy bill. Therefor a maximum use of heating (based on the average/normal use) in the bedroom is appreciated. Since we all have our own habits and expectations, more needs of heating use is surely possible in consulting with me. If I would knew Eva's needs during her stay, things could be different and beter. At least, I'm glad for you, as you wrote in your messages to me, that you had a good time. At the moment, from central station to my apartment, the last public transportation is around 00:30.  Before COVID, it was 24 hours reachable. Thanks Dominic.<br/>A little clarification: Domonic meant you need 20 minutes walk to catch the metro station. From there its 3 minutes to central station where is the absolute centre of the city. If you take bus, you need 5 minutes walk to the bus stop, then 4 minutes to the metro station. Big surprise to me as Romain told me verything was good during his stay. <br/>It's always mentioned in the listing ""Private room"", never ""Private apartment"". Since it's a big building with many apartments, we all try not to take a shower after midnight to show our respect to neighbours and possible housemate, so that we all can have a good sleep and enjoy our life more. I'm sorry if Romain didn't read it properly and became upset. I think you can never be friends with everyone, nor satisfy everyone in our life. Let other guests tell the truth is my response to Tizz.<br/>Hopefully Tizz found a more suitable place for her and enjoy her stay. normally 18 minutes, rush hour 25 minutes to the absolute centre of Amsterdam is not very far for a big city I think.

4077707,"It was super nice to host you. I‚Äôm really glad you had a great time here Thanks so much Robert. I hope you got inspired for your project.

4091515,"Hi Holly <br/>Bedankt voor je review <br/>Jammer dat je ons niks hebt gezegd. Nu kunnen we je natuurlijk niet meer helpen. Maar we waren er wel voor je om te helpen. <br/>We hebben het zelfs gevraagd of alles naar wens was. <br/>Laat het een tip zijn voor je volgende verblijf. Wij gaan kijken wat er met het toilet is. <br/>Hartelijk dank Beste Jean, <br/>we vinden het erg jammer om je 3* recentie te lezen. We hebben u nog gevraagd of alles naar wens was en op geluid na waar we helaas niet zoveel aan kunnen doen binnen de stad met een woning uit 1600 <br/>hebben we je andere punten niet vernomen.

4142666,"Dear Vivid, <br/>to inform us 3hours before your arrival time that you will have 4-5h delay made it complicated for us to do personal check in. So we had to deposit the key for you, which would be easy to pick it up as you arrived by car. <br/>We sent you the pick up address 1 1/2h before your arrival. You reacted to this massage 1h later after your parked your car.  That is not our fault here.<br/>You couldn‚Äôt reached Fernando (airbnb manager) as he told you he is in the plane not reachable. <br/>I agree, it was not the ideal check in experience but we did our most to give you a pleasant check in. It is out of our hands if you don‚Äôt read the messages in time. <br/>The apartment itself is in top condition and nothing is wrong it nor with the bed - everyone can see this with all the 5 star ‚≠êÔ∏è previous reviews. <br/>BTW there hair dryer was in the apartment and you didn‚Äôt see it. <br/>Regarding the noise, its facing the backyard where its quiet. <br/>Overall, nothing was wrong with the apartment - it my first time I am having a bad experience with a guest and I don‚Äôt see we did anything wrong here. Hi Iris, I am so glad to hear that you had such an amazing time. <br/>Wish you a great rest of the year! <br/>Take care! <br/>Florian "

Thank you for sharing your Travelstory and being so respectful :-) Thank you...! Fpr ou english speaking guests: Indescribable. Viola and Daniel are excellent hosts and welcomed us with great care and attention. The apartment is beautiful, complete, well decorated, comfortable (especially the bed, after long days of walking ... rsrs), clean and has a beautiful view. The location is very good. Away from the noise of the city center, yet within easy reach of everywhere, whether on foot, by bus or by Tram (# 3). Just below the apartment is Mad's Caf√©, a delicious place with an excellent service that is worth knowing. I stayed with my girlfriend and we loved the experience, we recommend it to all who want to live Amsterdam. We will be back! Thank you so much again, we'd be very happy to welcome you back :-) Oh wow jose.. how nice to read al this.... We'd like to thank you once more & welcome you back any other time...

Yours Ghislaine and Jean-Pierre Oh wow, thank you once again... we feel so humbled.. we loved hosting you both! Maybe we'll see eachother again in Minneapolis, that'd be lovely :-) We were greeted by Viola & Daniel very accommodating and friendly. The apartment is as described very sunny and bright. It is equipped with all the necessities. The area is quiet and fairly central. We felt very well.... | Thank you so much Susanne; we'd love t welcome you back any day! Merci Beaucoup! Thank you so much!!!  For our English- speaking guests: <br/><br/>We enjoyed the time in Amsterdam very much. Viola and Daniel have greeted both of us at the check in and given helpful tips regarding the apartment and respect Amsterdam. In addition, we were able to see many information material to fall back upon (including a guide which we unfortunately have  forgotten in our pocket; it is on its way back to you =)) The apartment is as described and shown in the photos, we felt very comfortable in our temporary home. Viola and Daniel were always available for us. We would be very happy to welcome you back! So nice to read your review :-) We'd love to see you guys again! Thank you so much again! | For our English speaking guests: ""Daniel and Viola were perfect hosts. We were really well received and got all the help and guidance we needed.<br/><br/>The property has a great location overlooking the canals. The residence is perfect for a couple and the location up to Jordaan is super."" Merci Beaccoup!!! For our English speaking guests.. ""We were very well received by Viola! Daniel and she had prepared us all the information to discover Amsterdam! The apartment is very nice and well located! It feels like home! So we had a great time: thank you!"" Thank you so much again! <br/>-----------------------<br/>Viola and Daniel really have a wonderful room - the photos do not lie! One has direct view of two canals and the small square outside the front door. In the basement of a building is more directly a caf√©. The apartment is not overly large (as is the staircase that leads to the top - which is Amsterdam-typical very narrow) but very comfortable and stylish. The bathroom is not separated by a door from the rest of the apartment, which one should note, if you are traveling as a couple :) Viola we have not met, but has given us a detailed briefing and Daniel in with tips on Amsterdam and lockers @ Central station.. All in all, I can only say: We would love to come back! :-) We wouldn't hesitate to welcome you back.. anytime! Thank you too once more, you're welcome back any time!  Oh wow.. we loved hosting you as well.. and thank you once more! Thank you so much too :-) Oh my, we feel truly humbled.. thank you once more! Feel free to come bye any time .... A very hospitable and welcoming apartment, nicely decorated and comfortable, in a corner of the city with an authentic neighborhood life both peaceful, simple, quiet and well local. It is in the city center quickly and easily by tram 3 that passes close to the apartment. Nice view of the canals. Very friendly, attentive and caring hosts. So nice to hear... we feel really thankful for your stay! Thank you too so much; we loved to host you both :-)<br/>---------------------------------------------<br/>We are extremely pleased that we Viola & Daniel were allowed to rent their apartment! It was very cozy, clean and fresh, with many light and it had a great view of the neighborhood. You sit close to the Haarlemmerplein, of which you are a seesaw at the station by bus and tram, and from which you can explore very Amsterdam (tram and bus). Also on foot provides the Haarlemmerdijk and - street a good base, whether you are so in the Jordan River or along the canals and even Dam is best to do on foot. Want to go to Amsterdam Noord: stab you with the pound around easily on the IJ. Be sure to check it with free wifi provided Westerpark 5 min. Walking distance, where you can eat in peace or drink without having to walk on the many tourists head :-). Also a big 'thumbs up' for Viola and Daniel who assist you in word and deed. Thank you so much & we'd like to welcome you back any time! For those who prefer an english translation:<br/><br/>Viola was very welcomed us that far from Amsterdam, she has managed so we can get the keys to her charming apartment at the corner cafe. The apartment is located 20 minutes walk from the central guard in a very quiet and nice neighborhood. It is exactly like the pictures on the site. Thank you Viola! Even thought Viola Was not in Amsterdam When we arrived, she let appartment 'keys in a coffee for us. His apartment is well up in a calm and beautiful quarter at 20min from the station. He is Exactly like pictures. Thanks a lot Viola."
4215174,"It was a pleasure hosting Sam and Lara in our apartment and to help them out when needed, which I consider a natural thing to do it with special attention.<br/>We would definately be very happy to host Sam and Lara again, and hopefully meet as well."
4221960,"Thanks for the nice review Angela. I even build the b&b for people upto 1,95 like myself. So I never have to bend down. Hi Noushin, <br/>It was nice to have you. There is no bathroom refresher in the bathroom.  What you smel is the luxerous Italian washperfume Lotus Diamant. I'm sorry if you don't like the smell... Hi Hilal, thanks for liking the boat. The machine next to the coffeemaker is a hot water dispenser. Dear Ron, I'm sorry to hear that it was too cold in the wheelhouse. We had such a nice conversation when you arrived,  If you told me this I could provide you an extra heater. In the advertisment I put in the square meters and it says  little,  so I'm sorry that you still were expecting something bigger.<br/>Grtz. Peter Hi Melissa,<br/>It was nice having you. As you can read in the advertisment; the whole boat is renewed not only the bathroom. There are pictures of the ladder and it says not handicap accessible. So I don't understand your comment about that. And next time please show me the stains as I couldn't find them, and I'm pretty uptight about stains and ironing ;-). So you didn't have to feel unclean.<br/>Grtz. Peter Thanks for the great review. To be accurate, the boat is in the middle of the centre. So it depends where your heading for how long your walk will be ;-) Hi Joshua, thanks for the great review. And just to be clear: The boat is in the middle of the centre of Amsterdam. There are even two more canals to go before central Amsterdam ends... Hi Ann,<br/>Thanks for the great review. I think people are aware that they don't get the whole boat. The title is: Private room on a boat, that's not the whole boat. It says that the owner also lives on the boat in the cargo space. And even the m2 are mentioned, which are 1/4th of the boat. So I think that won't happen.<br/>Grtz. Peter I think you didn't get the water tap. On both handles is a safety nob for more and hotter water ;-) Hi Scott, thanks for the nice review. There is a special shower matt and a bathmat for in the bathroom in the cupboard ;-)<br/>Grtz. Peter Thnx for the nice revieuw. The waterkettle is the black machine next to the coffeemachine, and there is an dustpan and tin next to the fire extinguisher ;-)<br/>Grtz. Peter You can make it as warm as you like by turning the thermostat as high as you want. Thanks Carla, about the kitchen these are the rules in Amsterdam for b&b's. But there was still the coffeemaker, theamaker, microwave, toaster, and the little oven. Hope to see you a next time.<br/>Grtz. Peter. It was nice having you and thanks for the bottle of wine. Jon is a very special person. In his former airbnb experience he had also problems as you can read in the reviews. He is very shy and doesn't look at you when you're trying to talk with him. He only uses cash money and doesn't have a telephone. I gave him the benifit of the doubt but I only can say refuse this man as he wants to book your accomodation.  My accomodation is what you read in all the reviews: 5 stars, clean and better then the foto's. So be warned if you except this man in your accomodation.<br/> Dear Vera, <br/>Thanks for the nice review. You felt little wind because you didn't close the skylight haha. The ship is in the centre of the city so I don't understand  from what we are far away? Hope to see you a next time.<br/>Grtz. Peter. Haha, this is wat Valerie wrote. She mixed up the private and public text.<br/>Wonderful host who offered to come and pick us 2 60+ year olds when we couldn't quite find the streets as our first time from Canada to this gorgeous city of Amsterdam. We soon were able to figure the ways of the Dutch who are the most accommodating in giving directions to tourists! We would love to have spent more time with Peter simply chatting but we were gone early in the morn and home late 9-10 pm and tired. The time went way too fast! Would recommend that people talk to Peter if they have any mobility challenges as the ladder from the glass top lounge area to the suite below is about 8 steps. Other than that, the heated floors, the modern bathroom, and most importantly the comfortable bed were simply awesome. Peter has a unique Airbnb sleeping ship that I would definitely love to come back too - a lovely park on the other side of the canal with flowering trees and tulips and weeping willow trees. Perfect! Thank you Peter - you are simply the best!‚Äù In the description you can read that the appartment is just 20m2.  You can also read that you will have your own private entrance. The pics show you also how little it is, there are no pics of big living space, bedroom, kitchen, etc.  In my profile you can read that we live in the other part of the boat. I don't know what i did to get this mean review. You even said goodbeye with a smile and friendly handshake?????  If you read the add you would have known that it is a part of the boat and 20 square metres. So if you expected to rent the whole ship that's your own fault not mine! Check out time is 1200 and you knew we had to go away ourselves and still you managed to be one hour late!!!! We put your things nicely in the wheel house so we could start to clean the lowerpart for the new guests. As you can read in all other reviews the b&b is always very clean, so also this time! I think you say that it's dusty just to be mean and I don't know why.  And although you were an hour late I still gave you a good review. The only thing I can think of is that you don't like gay people. The supermarket is less then 200 metres from the boat. It's also pointed out in the welcome brochure in the wheelhouse.  Next time when you are here I wil guide you to it ;-)<br/>Grtz. Peter. Thanks for telling me about the shower door. I will fix it today! <br/>Grtz. Peter. I know that downstairs the signal is weak because you are surrounded by the steel of the ship. But upstairs in the wheelhouse the signal should be ok.  I'm going to check it rightaway, thanks for telling me.<br/>Grtz. Peter. Nice and friendly guests!"

4355186,"To be honest, what do you mean bedroom not really with curtains? There are curtains. You cannot look through them. There is a narrow slot where you can look through. But I don't think you mean that? In the front of the appartement there are curtains where you can look trough, but if you want you can also put extra curtains down, where you cannot look through. I have send 2 emails about the check in time. I text here on her mobile phone. I left a voice mail. Still air bnb kept on calling about communcation proplems. I have had many contacts with air bnb. After many calls with air bnb, over a period of 5 days,  it seems that there was a technical problem. We think Diane did not get the email with I have send.  We (air bnb and me) should have recognised the thecnical problem earlier. It would have saved a lot off problems. Air bnb can not deleted the review with is a true review, but not for the fact of the communication. "

Hope you had a great time in Norway too.<br/> Hello Al,<br/>Bit of a late reaction, but I've been very busy with my son and doctors.<br/>Thanks for your nice comment.<br/>Yes for the windows I know. But as it is a ground floor apartment immediately at the street, it is no good idea to have open windows. (before the renovations I've been burgled that way). You are always welcome when you come back to Amsterdam.<br/>Best wishes<br/>Margot<br/>"

4415881,"Hi Margareda, the Amsterdam counsel doesn't allow us to have a private entrance, a private bathroom and cooking facilities. Otherwise it would have to be rented out as an independent home.  2 out of 3 is approved, as in my case private entrance and private bathroom.

X Hi Sacha, so sorry, I was too late for a review:-(<br/>It was great having you as a guest! Thanks for leaving the place behind  tidy. You're gladly welcome back any time!   Dear Rocio and Juan, it was a delight hosting you both. Hope to see you again! Hallo Peter und Brigitte, sch√∂n dass ihr da wart. Ihr seid immer wilkommen! Hi Hedy and Jeff, it was lovely  having you both! If I ever visit Texas I will remember your offer. And of course you are always welcome back!  Thank you Anett, it was lovely having you both. Hi Leara, I am very sorry to hear that you were not happy with the room. I was just wondering what amenities you were missing. There is an electrical outlet in the bathroom, because of Dutch legislation there is a lid on the outlet to protect it from water and damp. Many thanks Carlos and Martine, it was really lovely meeting you both! Come back any time! Thank you Matt & Helen, it was lovely having you both. Always welcome back! Thanks Eileen and Tim, it was great having you both. Always welcome back! Thanks Janice and Lindsay, hope to see you again! Hi Stoyan and Larissa, it was a pleasure to be your host. Thanks! Hi Anita, thank you. It was a pleasure hosting you both! Always welcome back. Thank you Valeria, it was great having you! Sorry I was too late for my review. Hi Alison, thanks, it was lovely having you both! Hi Nick, thank you. It was great having you both! Always welcome back! Thank you Alexandre, it was lovely having you!<br/> Hello Florence, I am very sorry to hear that you did not enjoy your stay. Your arrival was indeed a bit chaotic, but I do not think you can blame me for that. I had already checked in your husband and you arrived two hours later. Your husband had said he would let you in, because he was already in the room and had a key. When you rang the doorbell for the second time I went to the room to open the door (in case your husband had gone out) but your husband was in the room and was in bed listening to music with his headphones on. I was embarrassed by this and felt uncomfortable and that is why I quickly opened the door for you and left.<br/><br/>About the heating: I was in your room to bring clean towels and it was very warm in the room. You had turned on the extra heater I gave you so I do not understand this criticism either. And about the price: I do not think you can find a room in Amsterdam in such a location and with such facilities for this amount.<br/><br/>Again I am sorry that you were not happy with your stay but I think your criticicm is unjustified.<br/> Hi Freya and Charlotte, it was lovely to have you both. Hope to see you again! Thanks, Vera Hi Tyler, great to hear that you enjoyed your stay. It was lovely having you both! Thank you Uladzimir, it was great having you both! Hi Katie, thanks for the great review! Good to hear that you enjoyed your stay. Nurulfathiya and her friend left behind two yummie presents from there home country. Thank you very much, it is delicious!"
4443833,"We have a very strict cleaning policy. After every guest 2 cleaners make the place spotless. Many previous guests mention that. No mold whatsoever in the houseboat. The stairs are tiny but solid. You can easily access the beautiful roof terrace and enjoy the sun. Have a nice day. Thanks for your stay Kelvin. We have very cosy floor heating upstairs and radiators downstairs. The cleaning is always really well done and we refurbished the whole place one year ago. Hi Lynne, the text by the first photo clearly says that it is the surroundings of the houseboat. Hope you had a great time in Amsterdam. Cheers Nova Team Hi Fahrad, like in every big city in Europe parking is paid. We have a cheap private parking closeby and that is in the information we send every guest. The fridge works just fine. The only thing you had to do is turn it up from 3 to 6. We gave you the info for that. Sorry for that inconvenience. Hope you had a great stay in our beautiful houseboat. Cheers. hi Sharon, thanks for your kind words and your stay. Hope to see you again. Greetings Nova team Thanks for your stay and kind words. Hope to see you again in the future. üëçüèª Check in time is 14h and than there is always somebody there for the welcoming of our guests. This guest sent us a message that they decided to spent the day first in the city. We sent a message back that that was totally fine and we did send the check in details again. The guest arrived at around 19h. That is possible because we have self check in with a key box which is really appreciated by all of our guests. But obviously we cannot wait the whole day in house for a guest to arrive and that is also not necessary with our self check in. We responded at every message that this guest send us. Normally we go take a look the day after the arrival but this guest was only here for one night and checked out at 11am. There we‚Äôre no issues with this guest and everything went fine. You probably did not get the Amsterdam sense of humor Alexus. These hosts are the most fun and friendly people you can ever meet. Hope to see you next time. Hi Phillipe, we are happy that you like our houseboat. We have a private parking close by for only 10 euro per night. Our bikes are no sport bikes but solid city bikes and run perfectly well.  Thanks for your stay. There is a great view over the water especially if the swans swim by. All the info with the photos is in the listing. The first restaurant is literally at a five minute walk. There is a big supermarket at a 5 minutes bike ride. A car is totally useless in the Amsterdam center. We provide bikes to go into the city center and you can get there in 15 minutes. The bus is ‚Ç¨3 and a taxi will be around ‚Ç¨ 20. 99% of the houses in The Netherlands do not have air conditioning. No need, especially in a cool houseboat. The small spiders keep the few bugs away and they make a web in 5 minutes. We clean them every day in the summer season. These nice guests we're in Amsterdam on one of those rare days where  it was over 30 degrees celsius. Normally the houseboat is really cool, especially in the bedrooms downstairs where you sleep on the water level. Thanks for your stay. We try to be as clear as possible in our description of all the details in our listing. We realize it is a lot of information but still as a Airbnb guest you should read these details, especially the ones that are important to you. Unfortunately this guest was expecting some details to be different and we feel sorry for that. We have tried to be as helpful as we can and this guest stayed the whole period. Thanks Lotty, you are welcome any time. Nous sommes d√©sol√©s que cet invit√© ait des choses qu'il n'aimait pas dans notre appartement. Mais certains points sont tout simplement faux. Ce sont nos r√©ponses:<br/>- avec les v√©los, il faut environ 15 √† 20 minutes pour entrer dans le vieux centre √† un rythme normal.<br/>- Les salles de bain sont parfaitement adapt√©es pour deux personnes chacune.<br/>- Nous n'avons pas de probl√®mes avec trop de moustiques.<br/>- Nos fen√™tres √† double vitrage laisseront tout bruit √† l'ext√©rieur. Et nous sommes situ√©s dans un quartier tr√®s calme.<br/>- Nous sommes tr√®s fiers de notre hygi√®ne et dans presque tous les avis, nous recevons des compliments pour cela.<br/>- Dire que nous devons acheter des produits √† certains endroits est √©trange.<br/>- Notre maison est aliment√©e par des panneaux solaires et pour l'environnement, il n'est pas bon et pas n√©cessaire de laisser les lumi√®res allum√©es quand vous partez. Peu importe combien vous payez.<br/>- Il n'y a pas de panneau indiquant que vous ne pouvez pas parler aux voisins mais il y a un panneau qui dit que vous devez √™tre silencieux √† l'ext√©rieur et respecter nos voisins surtout la nuit.<br/>- Ao√ªt est la haute saison, donc les prix sont plus √©lev√©s.<br/>- Notre h√¥te a eu une bonne conversation de bienvenue avec cet invit√©. Hi Karen. Thanks for your stay. I was on a AirBnb trip myself but if you  had checked in at the time that was given (14h) you would have met my host.  We love to meet other hosts too.  The houseboat is heated just like a normal house. upstairs and also downstairs just turn on the heating system. Smoking is only allowed on the street side  ass dutch smoking laws are becoming more and more strict.   There are trams until midnight and buses run all night to and from the old center.  But off course in Amsterdam the bikes are more usefull.  thanks for your stay and hope to see you again. Greetings from Amsterdam  Our houseboat is very easy to find when you use Google maps or the very clear explanation we send to all guests.  We are happy they liked the place. We have bicycles and with a bike it is only 8 minutes to the RAI. Greetings and Thanks for your stay.  The tram is at maximum 10 minutes if you walk really slow. Restaurants and shops are in 5 minutes by bike which we provide for free. There is an information bulletin right at the entrance. The heating is very simple. The house is already pre-heated so you don't have to change a thing. About the door, it is a houseboat. Off course there is water besides the boat. There is fast wifi to sort out where you are and where you wanna go. There is also a large city map of Amsterdam in the houseboat and also guide books with directions. Please read all the info before you get to the Nova Houseboat.  Thanks for your comments Rafael. We we're not there because we really enjoy doing Airbnb trips ourselves, but we always leave the house in the safe hands of my mother. If you are on a trip you always have to do local calls if you want to ararange things. That comes with the travel. Rafael notified me that the wifi was not working and we arranged that within an hour somebody fixed that. Our bathroom is really spacious with a larga bathtub and a walk in shower and all of our walls are very good isolated according to the latest building technologies since the houseboat is only 2 years old.  Merci beacoup Claude. Au revoir. Harry & Anna We asked the 'old lady' (our next guest) if it was no problem that the previous guests (Ezequiel) could pick up their luggage later in the day and she said that it was no problem. I guess she changed her mind. I'm sorry about that.  * Nous essayons toujours d'accueillir tout le monde, mais nous ne sommes pas √† la maison toute la journ√©e. Par cons√©quent, nous avons un coffre-fort cl√©. Les informations sur les cl√©s que nous avons envoy√©s comme toujours par e-mail. <br/>* Nous avons eu un appel manqu√©. Nous avons √©galement rappel√©. Notre client n'a pas r√©pondu. Il a envoy√© un message texte qu'il √©tait occup√©. Lorsque nous avons un message texte envoy√© si tout allait bien, que le client n'a pas r√©pondu. <br/>* La route est √† quelques centaines de m√®tres et il ya un grand mur contre le bruit. Il ne provoque jamais de probl√®mes. With the bikes it is a 10 minute trip to the city centre. Closest big supermarket is at a 5 minute bike ride and there is a gas station with basic supplies in a 5 minute walk. Several bars and restaurants are within a 10 minute walk. The bathtub is pretty big so you have to be a little patient and just put hot water in there. There is definitely not a lot of houseboats in Amsterdam with better value. Just come and convince yourself.  Er staat een foto van het dakterras bij de advertentie.  Thanks Annika. You guys are always welcome. Greets No problem. Hope to see you again in the future. Greets Always say to the taxi driver that our houseboat is on the part of the Jachthavenweg that is within the roundway of Amsterdam. Don't let the taxi driver just drop you off without verifying if you have reached the houseboat.  The bed in the smaller bedroom is 150x200cm and if this is too small we have got a big airbed available from 160x200cm and 50cm thick. We have also got a comfortable sofa.<br/>With the bikes it is a 10 minute ride to the old centre. If you take a taxi it is also 10 minutes and the bus and the tram takes you there in 15 minutes. "

4473576,"Hi Bohdan,<br/>We are sorry that you had some wifi problems. We didn't know. In the front of the apartment it always works.  We have a spare wifi connection we would have provided if we had known. Any way we are happy that you had a good time. For the first time in all the years that we have been renting out this apartment we get a review like this. For the first time in years that I filled in on the hidden review that I would NOT recommend these people. Its very demanding and nagging people like this that make you want  to stop working with AirBnb or renting out the apartment at all. Dear Suzanne and Arno,<br/><br/>I think we can all agree this was not a perfect match. We usually really enjoy renting out our apartment and always try to make the experience as rich as possible for our guests. We always leave a bottle of wine, oil, vinegar, salt and pepper, teabags, binbags and shampoo for the first couple of days, to make the welcome more warm. As for the pictures, these are taken by Airbnb and I can assure you no extra lamps were used. The apartment used to be a part of our own home until the children grew up. Humidity has never been an issue and there are four large windows and a door to the patio that can be fully opened for fresh air. Our beds are standard sized (two boxsprings joined together, each 90x200 so effectively we are talking king sized 180x200). <br/>What happened with the tub is a very unfortunate event. Our house was built in 1655, therefore we need a special pump for the toilet in our apartment. Whenever we have guests we always tell them two things:<br/><br/>1)We live upstairs, please call us or ring our doorbell if you have any questions at all. We are always happy to help.<br/>2)The toilet works with a pump, so please do not throw any bandages, q-tips or plastics in the toilet because this can cause problems.<br/><br/>The second day of your stay you invited family over to spend the night. The next day the tub was flooded and you disappeared. We cannot be sure what happened exactly. We replaced the pump that same day. If you would have simply called us we would have done anything to make sure you could‚Äôve had a shower and would have fixed the problem immediately. Unfortunately you left right away, although we think it was probably for the best. We are glad you ended up having a nice time in Amsterdam at the hotel.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Hans en Nanette<br/> Thank you Dominik for your comments. It‚Äôs a pity we didn‚Äôt meet. About locking the door you can lock it and from the inside you can always open it! We were not aware that that was not clear. We shall add this information!<br/>Thank you for your stay, best regards Hans &Hans Hi Jean, thanks for your feedback. We had a check on the central heating and bought a new TV. Best regards Hans & Nanette Merci perfect friendly people, always welcome Thanks for your kind words Melanie! We hope to host you again in the future."
4512372,"Dear Mette, thank you for your review! I would just like to mention that basically all the windows, except for the front window, can just open. There are 4 skylights and the big sliding window in the back can just be opened. I probably should have explained that better, sorry about that. And regarding the fire escape we indeed want to put a staircase at the back near the sliding window. Thanks again for visiting! We trust our guests to comply with our house rules. If we feel that there has been a visit without permission, then we will ask in a correct manner. Whether this happens during a check out or afterwards should not matter. Hello Mick, thank you for your good review. Most old Amsterdam houses all have wooden floors. The sounds that come through are only the 'stamp / run' sounds. We hardly hear any voice or other sounds. We are happy to hear that everything else was good. Hi Sandra, Thanks for your review. You are right it was very very hot this July. We are not used to this kind of tempartures so we are also not really prepared for this but it looks that this kind of weather is going to be normal. So we really are going to invest in some professional fans/airco. The street noises are unfortunately typical city noises  and in these hot summer nights people do sleep with open windows so that doesn't really help. But we are always try to reduce this as much as possible. But again thanks for your observations we will work on this. And we hope to meet you again! Thanks for your nice review. And yes it was a little party in amsterdam when Ajax won from Juventus! Danke f√ºr die sch√∂nen Worte, wir freuen uns auf ein Wiedersehen!

We do have four sleeping places (1 double bed and two singles) .  And we do have a bedsofa if needed. But then you will have to ask for the sheets because it can happen that a fifth person will sleepover and that's not allowed in Amsterdam. But we will see if we can clearify this in the description of the place. <br/><br/>Kind regards,<br/>Lidia & Jean-Paul Thanks jacqueline, we hope to meet you again. Thanks for staying! Thanks Andrew, it was our pleasure. If you decide to come again you are very welcome!<br/>And.. we can get almost all kind of tours & tickets before arrival. Thanks so much!

And don't worry about checkout instructions, you were my guests and should enjoy your holiday. No instructions therefore and you left the apartment in great shape. Its so good to hear that you and your daughters felt at home. We really like it when people enjoy the house. Thank you so much for your kind words. So sorry for the misunderstanding on both sides. It also had to do with the change of booking in persons twice. I will pay more attention after this experience. Thank you Jennifer and your family. It was so nice meeting you and talking to you.

4663170,"üß° Echt een super mooie, persoonlijke en waardevolle review. Wij zijn blij dat jullie onze plek zo hebben gewaardeerd. De juiste match üß°. Ik had jullie graag live ontmoet! Thanks for your review. Really glad you appreciated our home and neighbourhood. Always welcome Thanks for your additional feedback. I will discuss with our cleaner. Bye bye Thank you for everything, Robin. I hope your online products also arrived in time. Have a good flight back. Will you visit other European cities? Thank so much for wonderful review üôèüèª Merci beaucoup, Thierry et famille Hi Melanie, I am actually surprised by your remark. In the first line of the add I tell the appartment is on the third floor. Also in the address/location which you received through airbnb it says the civic number including the floor. We even mention we don't accept small kids anymore (because of bad experience with kid who damaged many things + it is exhausting for the stairs. Add says Kids > 6 years... Anyway, thanks for taking good care of everything. Thanks, Juliette. If I understand well, the thing with the cats happened upon your arrival. As you know, people at airbnb are ordinary people with ordinary lives and ordinary animals. So this can happen. I think we overcompensated by being flexible with arrival date and departure time, also when you accidentally woke our neighbours at 24.00 o'clock and we helped you out when you locked yourself out. Enjoy your next airbnb stays, but maybe not mention the cats? Things like that can happen everywhere at airbnb. What a great testimonial. Thanks so much, Brenda, family and cats! Thanks so much, Finn. And I'll work on recommendation! Bye bye, Brenda Thanks so much, Amy. You were great guests as well!!  Dear Christina & Micke, thanks so much x"
4722235,"I am happy with the compliment about the pleasant contact, but a little surprised about the comments about the cleanliness; although quite minor, I think they are a bit unfair.<br/>About the cleaning fee: maybe something went wrong in translation Dutch to English to French. In the house information I ask to please leave the apartment tidy and take out the trash. This does not mean: clean the apartment, since this is indeed covered by the fee. I will rephrase so hopefully there will be no misinterpretation in the future."

Always welcome again Hallo Michael, dank voor je mooie recensie. Het lijkt erop dat jullie voor het eerst in een echte woning verbleven, dat inderdaad mijn eigen huis is.

4817958,"Hi Fanta, great that you liked the apartment as many guests before you. Regarding the shower, it has never been blocked before so I am really sorry that you experienced this problem and I gave you a refund for that of course. Also sorry that you did not respond to my help offer or that from a professional. It was fixed within 1 minute the day you left. So my advise if you experience any problem during your stay at an airbnb apartment please accept help offered if any problem should arise. All the best, regards Bastian Thanks Max was a pleasure having you guys over! Hi Steve thanks for the great review, much appreciated! Sorry to hear that you did not know towels, soap and hairdryer were available. It is ticked in the airbnb boxes so you should be able to sea that. I'll contact airbnb for that. Best, Bastian Thanks for your nice review and feedback Maria, yeah i have to think of something for the shower...thanks!"

Welcome back anytime!"
4865219,"Hi Hyun, thank you for your compliments on the apartment. Though, I think there is a difference in agreement about the distance between my house and Central Station. 15 minutes really is not very far away unless you wanted to be located next to the station. But the apartment is located perfectly in the centre of Amsterdam, and yes a 10 to 15 minute walk from central station. Hope the rest of your trip went well! <br/>Francesca"
4878850,"Hi Joseph, thank you for your feedback! It was a pleasure to have you and your mother as guests. I am sorry to hear that you missed a TV. I do indeed not have one, but that's mentioned in the list of not included facilities. The water pressure in the shower could indeed be better. I have an environmentally friendly, water saving boiler, which is good for the environment, but a bit at the expense of the showering experience. It‚Äôs a choice that I made, but I will look into the possibilities to improve the pressure without giving in on the water saving. Thank you again for your feedback!  Hi Anni, Thank you very much for your kind words. It was a pleasure to have you as guests. Regarding the tram to the centre, you might have taken the wrong tram. It will take you approximately 10 to 13 minutes with the tram from our place to Dam square in the centre. "
4883501,"Hoi Chris<br/><br/>We zijn nu pas terug van vakantie, vandaar de late reactie. Goed om te lezen dat jullie het leuk hebben gehad en goed gebruik hebben gemaakt van wat er in huis te vinden is. Dank jullie wel voor de recensie. Onze eerste :)!<br/><br/>Wat betreft dat geld, dat klopt inderdaad. Dat waren we vergeten weg te halen, mijn zus zou het z.s.m. ophalen, wij dachten dat het gebeurd was voor jullie aan waren gekomen, maar dat is niet het geval dus. Bedankt voor de tip in ieder geval, een seintje is nooit verkeerd. De lamp is inderdaad kapot gegaan net voor we gingen, hebben hem nog proberen te repareren, maar dat is niet gelukt. Mochten jullie in de toekomst weer op bezoek komen bij Seppe, laat het ons weten, misschien kunnen we wat regelen!<br/><br/>Groetjes Guus en Ilse"

Dear Sara, heart heart your review! thanks. thanks Diego! Enjoy! Hi Jorge..  Did you not realise you and the other guest were sharing the bnb? That is clearly stated in the advertisement. Yes, sometimes someone else comes in late or loud, that has probably not been on purpose by guest C. Im sorry you have to tell this in a review, with a low star number as a review too, instead of talking about it with me. You left without a goodbye, and now i realise why. I do remember you told me you had to be out on an early train to Rotterdam that morning. You had a very busy schedule. I hope you still enjoyed you time in this part of Europe. All the best to you. haha, thanks for the nice words. About the location: did you not look at googlemps to see where you were going to stay? In 25 minutes walking you are in the old city centre, and this neighbourhood is next to centre. Can be that airbnb is ""selling"" the place for something it is not, but i am not going to move my house :) So for me our Casa Vrolik is still a 5 for location, and i do hope for future guests too! Thank youououou! Enjoy the travels! oh, thats nice to read and hear, thanks Kayla! Loved having you..! Dear Julia, thank you thank you thanks! It was good having you! Enjoy the next part of travels! thanks! it takes two, so thank you for being who you are!  it was a pleasure to have you here and meet you. ohww, thanks! same! thank you, lovely kind words..! thanks!

Thank you Fan, for your great review! owww, i love reading this, THANKS! xxx T Thank you dear Maria! Id say we are close to the city, but deff in the second ring on the east side. When travelling by train to Amsterdam, its great to train on to Amsterdam Muiderpoort, the small train station on the way to Amstel Station, as it is 11 minutes walk to the house from there (and the most scenic route, i think). From our house walking to the old city its appr 25 minutes zig zag towards the amstel river and to the centre.. Love, Toetsie Yeahy! dear! Im happy you had such a good time, and thank you for your kind words! See you next time! Thank you Derek! Loved having you stay at the Casa V.! thanks for staying, Jon Thanks Anwei! it was a short but fun interaction, dear Heini! Enjoy the summer..! ""El espacio es suficiente.

Toetsie hahahaaa.. hurray for googletranslate! Thanks :D Yeahy! Thanks :) Although i think Centraal Station on a bike is around 15 minutes from our house, and with the tram/metro around 25 minutes... Still.. it's a nice secret to know that Oosterpark neighbourhood is this close to the city centre :) See you another time, Anis! Yeahy, thanks Harriet! Love your review and loved having you come stay in Casa Vrolik! &lt;3 thanks! Thank you for staying Richardson! Enjoy your travels! Toetsie Not shown is the word flat mates ;) <br/><br/>Thanks Josh, LOVE the review ;) Yes, that's how it pretty much is! <br/><br/>Hope to see you one day with your darling here in Amsterdam!<br/><br/>Toetsie and you are very welcome! Greetings, Toetsie Thank you, Leandro! Hope to see you again, Kristina!! Wonderful you loved it so much! That's making me happy. Lets make sure you get your shawl back soon through your friend! Yes, the city centre is about 25 minutes to the old centre, and about an hour to Jordaan-area. 10 minutes from the Amstel river. Dear Tudor!<br/><br/>As you and i concluded: In the end we didn't get along very well, and you are not a typical Airbnb user. I am sorry you had expectations that were not met: next time its a good idea to look at the pictures and read the info on the advertisement before booking a room. Especially if you pay 69 euro's a night.<br/><br/>One thing i want to right: I told you before entering the room that i needed to vacuum as that didn't happen yet, and you told me that was okay. When i came back from work i vacuumed the living room and not in your room as your things were spread out there. Your choice, darling. The vacuum cleaner was there to grab afterwards. <br/><br/>You didn't keep the place clean at all, and did stain the tea towel and trow out my spoon. And overall you were grumpy and not precise in your communication. When i informed before writing a review what was happening, your appeared to not be able to handle feedback. Im sorry you have to live like this. <br/><br/>Surprise: YES, you were staying with me in my house, and yes, the cat hair won't go away without some work, that you made impossible. All is exactly as in the pictures and in the text. Like: breakfast for the first morning. You expected miraculously food for all mornings. The kitchenette is a kitchenette. As shown on the pictures. All in all: Do more work if you want the deal. Amsterdam hotels cost around 195,00 to 350,00 per night. I suggest you do that next time! <br/>Greetings, Toetsie super! welcome whenever you pass bye Amsterdam! Thanks for staying Pedro!! Thanks Ashley! See you next time!  thanks! Thank you for staying and your great review, Anna: i love it that you described the Amsterdam Stairs as they are! I can't underline enough: travel light to medium to stay healthy yourself and pay for the environmental costs extra yourselves in compensating CO2 emissions when using cars, planes or boats during your travels!  :D Greetings, Toetsie Thank you!! Thilina, thank you for your review and it was a great week, see you next time! Thanks! super! Thanks, Patrick! Super thanks! :) super good to hear! enjoy!  Merci bien! Thanks! Merci Francoise! Oui, the kitchenette is really a kitchenette, and not a kitchen: you can make your tea there and keep you own beverages in the fridge. It's just there to prepare you breakfast. Im happy to hear the pictures are a good indicator of what one gets, and thank you for staying!! Toetsie It was my pleasure to host you! Welcome back next time! Thanks dear!! thanks Jordan! ah, good one about the bike rental place: i'll look that one up for other guests too. thanks dear Corli! until we meet again! Hurray! Looking forward to it! Toetsie whooooot!! Thank you dear :D blush blush ;) THANKS! Toetsie thanks!! :D Thanks Melody! Thanks!! Jeahy! Good to hear in these cold winter times :D  haha.. thanks! It was a pleasure having you! Oh, good to hear! Thanks! oh, thanks Daniel! Come stay again whenever you are in the neighbourhood! very welcome! :D :D Super! thanks! about the feature temperature: every room has its own radiator and guests can turn it on or off themselves, but.. i do have the heath on a system that makes the heat go low at night, and during the day hours. Its the Netherlands, so.. bring warm socks and a sweater and scarf when visiting :) Im happy it worked for you. <br/>Will see what i can do with the bathroom ;)  thanks! Very welcome! thanks! thanks for this nice review Lior! happy to have you! You are very very welcome, Gerry, as you know! Thanks. super! thanks for the great review, and see you again!

Thanks!  thanks!  thanks! super thanks! :D thanks :D I loved having you around, and the encouragement on getting the couch into the bnb really helpt in planning it!  yeahy, thanks for the review and greetings from me and Roky! thanks for the review and see you again! ha! thanks! jippie! Thanks! And good idea about the kitchenette! Thanks Paula! The cats made me mellow ;) Thank you for your kind words.. merci!  Thank you Andreina! Merci! jippie, dat vinden wij fijn! thanks! I love it that you had a great stay!! Thanks! It was nice having you as my guest. Although i really like it if my guests are genuine Airbnbers, who read up on their cities themselves. I am not a tourist guide at all..! I love it that you liked the stay in the little cozy and warm room :) thanks dear! Have fun on your adventures!  Thanks! Thank you Adriana! thanks tom!!  Super!!

4906957,"Thank you, Julie,  for your review. A few points to clarify: clearly you did not read and understand the listing, making it clear the studio is located in a house build in the 1800's situated is the historical part of Amsterdam. Clearly you also did not follow the detailed instructions by missing an orange door vs a green door. Amsterdam stairways are renowned by seasoned travelers as interesting and characteristic,  pity you did not enjoy  it. Like in any big inner city, the  variety of the cosmopolitan makeup of  people comes with noise and sometimes groups hanging around. None that has been a threat for the many  that have come and gone;  by design this is a safe area.  By ""miracle"" our green street is rather quiet. Your other minor complaints were made halfway your stay & resolved immediately. Sadly you moved all furniture around and left a huge mess, not very charming. You were loud and noisy stumbling up the stairs as you remember, which was no different to our street guests. Thank you Joey for your valuable review. Unfortunately, your last weekend was during the Formula 1 race, which is one of the worst weekends in the year - in terms of noise...In addition, as you point out, the inner city just around the corner from the red light district attracts some types of tourism that we would happy to get rid off. Too bad not everybody is like yourself and all the guests we have! :) Thank you Kathleen for your review and nice words. You were absolutely great guests, taking such good care of the apartment. I enjoyed talking to you and getting to know you. Welcome back any time!<br/>I just discovered that somehow I managed to let 14 days pass and am no longer able to write you a review. My apologies! Muchas Gracias, Juan! Muy amable. Thank you so much, Mike, for your review. Really appreciate it. Wish all guests were like you guys!<br/>I would like to leave a note here to tell anybody checking my review of you: Mike and Mary were exemplary guests; due to a mix up I indicated they did not follow all house rules. BUT THEY DID! :) Thank you for your feedback. I would love to have a real kitchen for our guests, but unfortunately the city council does not allow that. Richard, thank you for your review and all your kind words. It was fabulous to have you and your wife stay with us. You were great guests and even greater visitors.<br/>I just realized I have missed the opportunity to write you a review, my apologies. Danke Sch√∂n/Merci beaucoup!<br/>It was lovely having you, Inge, and thank you for your kind words. Merci Jane pour vos sugestions. Juste pour dire que c'est indiqu√© dans les 'amenities' qu'il n'y a pas de cuisine. Je vais inclur l'information encore une fois dans la description aussi pour que √ßa soit clair.<br/><br/>Thank you Jane for your sugestions. May I point out that it is mentioned in the amenities that there is in fact no kitchen. I suppose I should add the same information in the description as well.<br/><br/>Cordialement<br/>Kind Regards<br/>Regina"
4909610,"Proud to present the rest of Cheryls recommendation:<br/><br/>""This was a perfect location and gorgeous apartment. We loved staying here as we were in Amsterdam to visit our nephew who stayed with us. We really enjoyed the neighbourhood as it was easy walk to the attractions we wanted to see and very relaxing place at the end of the day to go out and have a drink or dinner from."" "

4917532,"Thanks so much and glad you liked the books :) Yes the toaster is a thing! I also miss it, it broke down recently, sorry you had to do without...<br/><br/>Thanks for the feedback and great you had a good experience overall!<br/><br/>Till soon somwhere :) Dear Wendy wow, thank you so much! It was such a pleasure to host you, hope to cross paths next time :) Thanks Terry, Amsterdam awaits you anytime :) Merci beaucoup Julien, avec tout grand plaisir! Dankjewel Pajaree, it was a pleasure to host you!  Thank you Conchi for your super nice comments!!  ( or at least I hope I understood them well with my poor Spanish :))) Gracias Alejandro! Si, no hay monta√±as en Amsterdam pero empinadas escaleras :) Thanks for your feedback Joao, we were so glad to host you! Grazie altrettanto Federica! A la prossima volta  :) Thanks so much Carly it was a real pleasure to host you!! Thanks so much Amy, so glad you enjoyed your stay, it was a treat to have you! Thanks Ed, come bsck 'home' anytime! Thanks, glad to host you! Thanks so much Alessandro, you were a great and gracious guest indeed  (-:. Till next time! Thank you Natasah,<br/>You have been great guests. I do hope your journey back home was good.<br/>Best regards,<br/>Nathalie Thanks for your good comments, yes we've had some quick changovers and exceptionally wet weather which did not always allow laundry to dry as quick as we wanted to (-: but we will make sure to do this differently in the future. We hope you enjoy your stay anyway, thanks for helping us to take care of the details! I am sorry that you did't realise that the stairs are so steep... It is always so in the older Dutch houses. I will make a notice (clearlyer) that the second bed is smaller than usual. You did't find the extra matras which has been more convenient for one child. Next time please phone...<br/>Best regards<br/>Nathalie"
4937229,"Dear Marie-Anne, Thanks for your feedback! We will replace the mattress you mentioned. Mice are unfortunately a common problem in Amsterdam, but our cat normally scares them away. Since we send him away during our holidays, they seem to prove their luck coming in from the neighbours. We will warn future guests to stow away any food during the night. Cordialement, Guido Vielen Dank f√ºr die R√ºckmeldungen, es war eine Freude, Sie und Ihre Familie und Freunde kennen zu lernen."
4994590,"Ik begrijp niet dat de aankomst zo laag heeft gescoord. <br/>De aankomst was laat, ik was persoonlijk thuis voor de ontvangst en de gasten wegwijs te maken, ik heb de zware koffer naar de kamer getild, er stonden twee oranje Koningsdag tompoucen klaar. Er was koffie en thee en in de koelkast twee pilsjes.<br/>Helaas had het airbnb platform<br/>storingen, mijn berichten werden niet ontvangen. Yes, we understand. We are a non-smoking and no drugs accommodationüòä Thanks for your nice review Oscar. To make it clear for other people: cellar means souterrain. At street level you take stairs down but at the back of the house you are at garden level.  It has windows, and double doors opening up to our small garden. So, enough daylight :-) Thanks for your review. The room is indeed in our house and to clearify it to others, space means corridor. In our reservation details we wrote a very detailed description about how to get to our house, which is - by the way - very easy as all public transport is near. A few days before arrival, we send our guests  the route from the metro to our house. This is hardly a 5-minutes walk. Apart from that, there is a picture of our house on the website. This all to make it as conveniant as possible for our guests. Thanks for your review, we are at 100 meters away of the official city center.<br/>But the good thing about our place is that it is in a quiet though lifely street  along the Amstel riverside and not in the hustle and buzzle of the hardcore center.<br/> Dear Franziska,<br/>Thank you so much for your kind review.<br/>We would love to meet you. Maybe another time?<br/>All best,<br/>Edith & Harald The accomodation is not big , including bathroom, kitchenette and privat toilet the privat space is 20 m2, that is what is written in our description. <br/>And outside our guests have a garden terrace. Thanks for your review Araminta. In 19th century houses in Amsterdam, all stairs are like this. In more ordinary houses they are even 20 cm's smaller. But with heavy luggage, stairs are always a challenge :) Dear Pamela, Thanks for your nice words. As you arrived late and your friend was already waiting for you, we offered you both some cups of tea to make you arrival more comfortable and gave suggestions about the city. As you forgot your cheese, Harald especially came back home in between appointments for you. Usually we are very flexible with early arrivals and luggage to stay, but sometimes it is just not possible. <br/>We have tried to be as accurate as possible in the description of our house with photos and in writing also mentioning some steps. For that reason we wrote that our house is not convenient for guests with a handicap. I think it is a good idea to underline steps in our description.<br/> Hi Lucy, <br/>We did not hear you coming home. If we had any trouble by walking of our guests through the house we would not started the BnB. That is not a problem, the house has enough space. You were nice guests. And thanks for the bottle wine!!<br/>See you or your friends again, all best, Edith & Harald Dank je Victor. en wat het gordijn betreft:  wij gaan de gordijnen binnenkort vervangen door verduisteringsgordijnen.  We were also very happy having you as guests.  Thanks Maria, We improved our WiFi system with a booster and a extra access point.  Thanks Naomi and Charly, We improved our WiFi system with a booster and a extra access point. It is now working fast and well."
5004150,"It was unfortunate that the washing machine broke and I will definitely get that fixed! Thanks for staying. about the smoking part I just do not want my one room apartment to smell after weed. Sorry to say but I allow regular cigarets not marihuana or other drugs. Even though this is Amsterdam it is still my house and I do not want anyone using drugs in my house. About the balcony it is small. I will make that rule more clear in my house rules. So that you could book a other house the next time. About the plates I am just offended. My house is very clean and I always make sure the guest have some breakfast. About the stove, there was an issue with this. I got a handyman to get it fixed before they stayed. I always tell my guests they can reach me for anything. So about the stove if they just told me anything was wrong I would have immediately got some one over there to get it fixed. <br/>"

You are very welcome to  come back. Thank  you for your wonderful review, we are very happy  that you enjoyed our accommodation. There is no cooking plate in the kitchen, since this is not allowed by the local municipality of Amsterdam. We offer a combi microwave oven that you can use to heat up food. Moreover we offer an egg cooker, coffee and tea  facilities and a milk frother to prepare a breakfast.  We hope to welcome you again! Thank you,  and we are happy that you and your family enjoyed our accommodation. We hope that your little boy enjoyed the ducks and the swans. Muchas gracias por esta bonita rese√±a.

5037506,"Beste Michael,<br/>Wij weigeren vrijgezellenfeesten, dat was heel duidelijk gecommuniceerd!<br/>Je bent daarin niet eerlijk geweest en kun je deze ontvangst verwachten.<br/>Ik als eigenaar had jullie geweigerd dus dankzij Erik is jullie feestje gered! Ik zal hier melding van maken bij Airbnb. Hello Ian,<br/>Excuses voor de late reactie, ik (de eigenaar) was in het buitenland.<br/>Het adres klopt maar is de ingang van het terrein aan de andere kant.<br/>Sorry voor de lekkage problemen en het verstoren van privacy, Erik probeerde deze te herstellen in jullie afwezigheid, hij verwachtte niet dat er zo laat in de middag nog mensen in bed lagen. Maar bij problematiek trachten we meteen op te lossen.<br/>Het schip is geen hotel maar een gedeelde accommodatie en is er juist personeel aanwezig om overlast te voorkomen en acteren we ook als er overlast is. Het was duidelijk gecommuniceerd dat we geen feestlocatie zijn. Onze ervaring is dat groepen niet alleen gelaten kunnen worden ten aanzien van de omgeving en veiligheid<br/>Met vriendelijke groet,<br/>Olaf Hi Sam, What a shame you felt this way about our ship. We don't recognise what you say nor have any of our previous guests mentioned this. Thank you for your blunt honest opinion, we truly hope you enjoyed Amsterdam! Merci Maxime! Danke Dejvid! Thank you Flore, it was a pleasure hosting you! Thank you Michael, it was a pleasure hosting you! Thank you Max, it was a joy hosting you guys! Merci beaucoup Alize, you were wonderful guests! Thank you Adam, we don‚Äôt have Wifi, we don‚Äôt advert we have and we certainly didn‚Äôt promiss you there would be. We hope you enjoyed your stay. Thank you Jenny, it was great hosting you! Danke Doreen, Die Informationen √ºber den Host an Bord (eine obligatorische Sicherheitsanforderung auf Schiffen) sind ausf√ºhrlich in unserer Airbnb Anzeige enthalten. Thank you for your lovely words, very kind! Merci Philippe! Thank you Lucille, it was a pleasure having you! Thanks! You were great guests. Danke Daniel! Thank you, it was a pleasure hosting you guys! Thank you Neill, it was great having you guys, wishing you a Beautiful wedding and lots of hapiness! Thank you for your kind words and fantastic review. It was a pleasure having you and we truly hope youcan make it out hete for the summer and sail with us around Unesco‚Äôs Waddenarea! Thank you Alex! Thank you Reshma, it was great having you as our guests! We hope you got the things you forgot, we send it to you!  Thank you Dennis, it was great having you guys!  Hi Kate, Sorry to read it wasn‚Äôt to your complete satisfaction! We wished you hd told us about it before or during your stay, so we had a chance to look for ways to help you!<br/>You were great guests to have and we wish the bride to be an amazing wedding!  Alex, Vielen dank, bis in sommer? :-) Danke Charlotte! Thank you Olga, it was a pleasure having you as our guests! Thank you Sue, it was great to have you as our guests! Thanks Calum, welcome back anytime! Thanks Steve, it was great having you guys! We were hapy to be part of the surprise plan and do a late personal check in for you. <br/>The location of the ship is a 20 minute walk downtown or 6 stops by either tram or bus, which stop right oposide the ship. The gas ran out, that can happen and is hard to predict, we always have new  bottles on board and are on board 24/7 for any assistance as we also told you more then once, a bit of an unfortunate situation you took  a new keg without notifying us! We hope you had a nice weekend over all! Dear Sabine, thank you for your review, it's unfortunate to read your stay wasn't  completly as you had wanted it to be, we wished you had told us so when you were here with us, so we could've cleared some of it up and helped you sooner or perhaps more to your sattisfaction.<br/><br/>I will  try to answer some of the points you mention, hoping it will clear some misunderstanding or miscommunication up.<br/>As for your acces to the boat there is always a staff member of the boat (or the one next to it) on board to make sure no unwanted guest are able to come in, due to safety regulation on the ship it's not allowed to completly lock the doors, we have never had unwanted guest in the past, the owners and staff of the boats here keep an eye out for everybodies wellbeing. <br/><br/>About getting on the boat, Boats need to lign up the way they do to all be able to lie close to the pier, hence the stepping onto other boats, we like to think it's part of the charm of staying on a boat instead of in a normal hotelroom! But we are always willing to help with luggage, children etc. By making the acces easier if we can.<br/>On ships we use gas and water tanks, when they run out there's always somebody on the boat to fix that straight away and within minutes.<br/><br/>As for the internet, due to the bad weather the network was down but we offered you and in the unlikely event it happens,our personal hotspot for emergency use, luckily now we have a more stable wifi connection.<br/><br/>The distance to town varies depending where you want to go to in the city center, the Spaarndammerstraat is right opposide the boat and that will bring you to the some parts of the city center like ' de Jordaan' in minutes walking distance, also there's a busstop near the Boat as well, we also provide maps and information about public transport or bike rental.<br/><br/>For you and all future guests please let us know straight away when there is a problem or an issue you like us to help you with, we are more then happy to assist and make your stay as comfortable as possible. Thanks! It was a pleasure having you on board!"
5043918,"Wow Alen, we did communicate with you prior and ask you when would be the best time. We let you on early check in and when my husband needed to be in and out you guys in afternoon on your early check in you were absolutely waisted. I think you may have forgotten we politely asked. You answered you might be out late afternoon and it was fine. Please check your communication. Thank you Ludovic & friends!  Thank you Georg, great to hear you had a good time. Dear Yaov, unfortunately the toilet on the second floor was broken just before you arrived. I tried to get it fixed immediately, but since a particular element needed to be ordered, I could not fix this in time. Sorry about the inconenience this caused."

Dankje ,üôèvoor je prachtig recensies, maybe next time üòÑ Hoi , wat fantastisch om je recensie te lezen , een waar genot, üôè Flo, jij bent ook een geweldige, aardige gast. Debora, fijn dat je de kamer mooi vond en de omgeving zen vindt Hoi Margu√©rita, jammer dat je zoveel kritiek<br/>Hebt. De kikkers daar kunnen we niks aan doen. De warmte daar hebben we nog geen<br/>Klachten van gehad, anders hebben we ventilatoren. Een lamp bij de spiegel zullen<br/>We voor gaan zorgen. En de auto parkeren aan de weg is toch normaal. En het is nog gratis ook. En we hebben je al gemeld dat het veilig is. En als je de recensies leest dan is iedereen juist lovend is  over het ontbijt.<br/>Maar je mag jouw oordeel geven en net wat je  zegt de prijs is goed, . Hoi Hermina jullie zijn ook erg aardige, geweldige en enthousiaste gasten. Leuk jullie ontmoet te hebben. Dankjewel voor je mooie woorden Hallo Joan, gelukkig heb je het naar je zin gehad op Reijgershof. Helaas aan het geluid van buiten kunnen wij weinig doen. De ene heeft er meer last van dan de andere.<br/>Maar over het algemeen hebben we er weinig<br/>Klachten over. Bedankt voor je bezoek . Dankjewel voor dat mooie woord. Excellent betekent een ‚Äú10‚Äù haha üòõ Hoi Corina, wat fijn dat je zo genoten hebt van mijn tuin. Ja, het is heerlijk om ‚Äò‚Äòs morgens te ontbijten in het zonnetje bij het meertje. En fijn dat je je welkom voelde. Ja, de katten zijn echte knuffels. En leuk dat je weer terug wil  komen. Je bent van harte welkom ü§ó ü§óü§óü§óüòä Hoi Annika ik ben blij dat je het zo goed ervaren hebt. Ik was ook blij met je bezoek want jullie zijn ook geweldige gasten. Tot ziens Zo lief je woorden. Daar zijn wij heel blij mee. Het is de bedoeling dat de mensen die bij mij komen het zo naar hun zin hebben. Dankjewel voor je mooie recensie. En ik was ook blij met jullie bezoek. Wauw wat een mooie recensieüòÅ<br/>Ik was ook blij met jullie wat zijn jullie een mooie mensen. Jullie zijn ook een leuk stel. Jullie waren fijne gastenüëçüèª Goh Pichon, dat zijn hele mooie woorden. Dat maakt mij erg blij. Ik bof ook met allemaal fantastische gasten. Dankjewel Annelies blij dat je zo over deze plek denkt.

Ben blij dat jij en je vrouw het naar jullie zin hebben gehad. Hoop jullie nog een keer te mogen begroeten bij de B&B Fijn om te horen , hopelijk zien we je nog een keer terug üòé Dank voor je advies aangaande de foto‚Äôs, ga er werk van maken üëå Eliot C'est agr√©able √† entendre ! Jusqu'√† la prochaine fois. Het telefoontje van u was ook zeer aanvallend! Waar geen enkele host blij van wordt. Uiteindelijk heeft u toch uw ontbijt gehad heel vroeg in de ochtend. Danke du bist welkome we just spoke to you. you were the one who started a discussion. we have figured out why you can't park on our private side. If you had read the information on Airbnb carefully and also the personal information, you would not have been on our private property.  <br/>And it came across to us that you were not at all interested in what we had to say. you have stayed for 1 night on arrival immediately left for the center and only returned very late. So the issues you have now are not subjective at all. Even though we were not bothered by you, logical because you were not on the site, I think you fit better in a 5 star hotel than on a farm in nature. Dank je wel! Tot de volgende keer. Dank jullie wel en tot ziens! Dank je wel tot ziens Communicatie...2?<br/>I don‚Äôt know what you really want!<br/>We let you in at 9 o‚Äôclock in the morning ( normal at 14.00 hour). We had contact before and at breakfast time n the morning. <br/>We are a bed and breakfast and no Hotel! Dank je wel jullie zijn welkom! Thank You It‚Äôs a farme. Thasnk you for your lovely and personal review. <br/>King gives his regards to you! Dank je wel Nadja ,jammer dat we elkaar weinig hebben gezien maar hopelijk tot een volgende keer  Dank jullie wel !!!!!"
5162447,"Alexandra zou eerst met twee stellen komen, maar kwam uiteindelijk met twee groepen waarbij een stel niet met elkaar de kamer wilde delen. Ze vroeg (voordat ze kwam) nog of ze de derde kamer kon huren die in de advertentie vermeld staat. Ook staat erbij dat het geen derde kamer is, maar ooit een tweede slaapkamer was die nu is doorgebroken en gebruikt wordt als een grote slaapkamer.  Ook heb ik toen al gemeld dat er een matras op de grond ligt en dat ze die kan gebruiken. Ze heeft niks extra's hoeven te betalen voor het extra bed. Na aankomst vroeg ze al om een extra handdoek omdat de handdoek die ze had gekregen volgens haar niet groot genoeg was. Terwijl het een gewone handdoek was. Daarna het gedoe midden in de nacht. Nadat ze s'nachts thuis waren gekomen (en ik verwacht in verschillende groepen want anders hoef je de sleutel niet in het sleutelkluisje te bewaren, maar heb je hem gewoon bij je) bleek het sleutelkluisje te klemmen. Ze heeft ons toen wakker gebeld om 01.30 uur in de nacht. Terwijl ik mij afvraag wat wij hadden kunnen doen, midden in de nacht? Toen bleek echter dat ze toch de sleutel hadden en naar binnen konden (en ons dus voor niets wakker hadden gebeld) vond Alexandra het gek dat ik daar niet heel blij van ben geworden. Al met al niet iemand die ik snel weer mijn huis zou aanbieden om te gebruiken. Hi Simona, I will change it. Thanks for the feedback Hi Alessandro, I will do that. Thanks for the feedback. Hi Dan,<br/>I hope you had a nice trip home. We mis our butterfleet (bucket for the butter). Did you or your family perhaps took it with you? Regards, Roland  Hi Roxanne, I hope you had a nice trip home. We mis our butterfleet (box for the butter). Did you or your family perhaps took it? Regards, Roland  Hello Daniele,<br/>Thanks for your response. It was nice to have you as our quest. I hope you enjoyed Amsterdam. You left our place very nice and clean!"

Hope to meet you again and have a great time in Arnhem. Oh, what a wonderful review. My heart is jumping up and down with joy. This is the reason to have an Airbnb, to meet great people like you. Next time, and I sincerly hope there's is gonna be a next time, we must have dinner together and I'll take you to some lovely museums like the Kroller Muller, who has one of the largest collections of van Gogh paintings and interesting modern art, and to Het Zuiderzeemuseum  in Hoorn.  The Kroller Muller museum is located in one of the most beautiful wild life parcs, the Hoge Veluwe and Het Zuiderzeemuseum is in the province North Holland, flat land and lakes and famous for Hollands licht (Dutch light), painters fall in love with it. <br/>The story of how you met Jan Six and his wife is really memorable. You are the first guests who went to see the art collection of Jan Six and writing a lettre in advance is unique and I'm sure he was so charmed, that he invited you. Great story. <br/>Now my idea is to print it out, frame it and put it on the wall to inspire other guests. <br/>Hope to meet you again. Thank you so much. You really make my day.<br/>You are more then welcome to come back. Hi Padma,<br/>Thank you for your very kind review.<br/>Sorry to hear that there was enough ventilation. I fixed that right away. <br/>It has been an very hot month. In May temperature usually does not rise above 20 degrees.<br/>Thank you for staying at my place.<br/>Kind regards,<br/>Simone Thank you so much for your kind review. Really appreciated. Have a safe trip back home and if you ever need a place to stay in Amsterdam, please be my guest. Oh wauw, great review. Please, come back again :) you're most welcome. Hi Rob, Thank you for your staying and for the great review. Ah, thanks thanks thanks fot the wonderful review<br/>You already know,, you are most welcome.<br/>Bye,<br/>Kind regards and 'knufs' (hugs) from Ella. Hi Inga,<br/>Thank you for your kind review and you, your husband and Scotty are most welcome. :) THANK YOU :) :) Oh Camille, thank you so much for your warm hearted review. Really much appreciated and I would love to see you back. Visit Amsterdam again when the weather is fine and we can drink wine with a view on the parc. In summer, spring it's much nicer to travel around and visit typical Dutch villages, eat haring and eal and visit Giethoorn 'The venice of the north'. We could also visit the waterworks. It's quite impressive; Holland is below sealevel so we really have to make sure the water of the rising sea, keeps out. Thank again and till next time. Hi Luninita,<br/>Thank you very much for your warmhearted review. It was great to have you as a guest. Maybe the dance-event will be in Amsterdam next year. You are most welcome to stay again. Bye. Hi,<br/>Oh, thank you so much for your kind reply and 5 star rating. Really great.<br/>I have the pictures I would like to send you.

Wish you al the best and have a great time in Berlin and all the other places you visit in Europe. Thanks for your great review. Since you have an Airnbnb yourself and you are a Superhost, your review means a lot to me.  Thank you for your positive and nice review. Thank you for your nice review.

If you ever want to stay in Amsterdam again, please let me know. You are most welcome. Bye. Hi Marina,<br/>Thanks you so much for this very possitive review. I liked you company very much and wish you will stay at my place once again. Oh, thank you so much for this lovely review. You really make my day, it gives me a real good feeling that I could contribute to a possitive Amsterdam-expirience. Hope to see back one day and give a lot of kuddles and kisses to Reggy. This dog was a very good guest. Bye Hi Amit,<br/>Thank you so much for this wunderfull hartwarming review. It was a real pleasure to have you as my guest and I bless myself lucky to host people like you. I really hope you will visit Amsterdam once again. I wish you all the best.<br/>Simone, Joerie Dankjewel Yvonne. Het was heel fijn om Maro te gast te hebben en heb er veel plezier in gehad om hem kennis te laten maken met het oer Hollandse fenomeen Sinterklaas. En gezien het enorme klimaatverschil tussen Tanzania en de Hollandse natte kou leek me aangepaste kleding wel heel toepasselijk en nuttig. (Nuttig, ook zo'n goede Hollandse uitdrukking...). Hartelijke groeten. Dankjewel Yvonne voor deze hartverwarmende recensie. Fijn dat Maro het zo naar z'n zin heeft gehad. Artsen van jouw organisatie Eye care zijn ook in de toekomst van harte welkom. Bij langer verblijf van een gast kunnen zouden we kunnen kijken naar een aangepaste en meer comfortabele huurprijs. Dankjewel voor de tip van de gordijnen. Daar heb ik wat aan. Ik snap dat als je 's ochtend na een feest wilt uitslapen de gordijnen te licht zijn omdat de kamer ook nog eens op het zuiden is. Ga ik regelen. Hi Peter and Ruedi,<br/>This review really makes me smile.<br/>This it exactly what I wish for my quests; that you feel at home.<br/>You are really relaxed and easy to get along with.<br/>Please send me your e-mail so I can send you the pictures. They are really cool. Regards Simone Henken Hi Ellen,<br/>Het mooie van airbnb is dat ik zoveel leuke en interessante mensen kan ontmoeten. Jij was daar zeker eentje van. Thank you Takako for your possitive review. I'll send you the pictures today. Have a safe journey home. Het is absoluut een genoegen geweest om jouw te gast te hebben gehad. Ik vind het erg fijn om te horen dat je het naar je zin hebt gehad, dat het bed je een goede nachtrust heeft bezorgd en dat de hondjes je een 'echt thuisgevoel' hebben gegeven. 'Drop by' wanneer je dit maar nodig hebt. Mijn deur staat voor je open. En 'all the best' voor jouw hondenkind. Knufs voor Noa. Hi Pupe, Thanks for your warm reaction. Please come back to Holland again. And since you love the pictures su much I will send you some more this week. Bye Thank you, Irene for you elevating review . Come back soon and tell me all about your trip around the world. Take care. Thank you Mike and Catherine.<br/>I really enjoyed your stay and conversations and when your in town again you are most welcome. By that time the new room will be finished and decorated. Maybe you like to try it out. Bye Bye. Hi Jekatarina en Andrey,<br/><br/>Thank you for you're lovely feedback."

(there is an iron next to the ironing board, and by all means, please do feel free to contact me, also during your stay, it would have been an easy thing to explain - and for you to find - where extra towels, and the iron, are situated!:) "

5297940,"Thanks for warnung us, we will replace them! Es tut mir leid dass es euch nicht so gefallen hat. Was die Erreichbarkeit betrifft, war das nur zur Folge einer kurzen Baustelle was jetzt schon wieder vorbei ist, da habt ihr einfach Pech gehabt. Was die Couch betrifft das stimmt wir haben die Bank zeitlich hinaus gestellt weil G√§ste gerne draussen sitzen m√∂chten jetzt im Herbst stellen wir es wieder hinein. √úbrigens  finde ich es entt√§uschend dass ihr den verlorenen Hausschl√ºssel nicht habt kopieren lassen. Trotz alledem fand ich euch nette G√§ste<br/><br/>Herzliche Gr√º√üe<br/>Helga und Theo Thank you very much, Diana Jabbor didn't mention his misuses of the microwave/oven. The hole apartment was stinking from black burned bread!  Kein problem, es hat uns gefreut euch als Gast zu haben.

Bussez run every Dank voor je reactie. Wat betreft veiligheid hoef je je geen zorgen te maken. Het balcon aan de achterzijde is niet toegangelijk van buiten. De binnendeur van het appartment kan van buiten geopend worden, wij willen als hosts altijd toegang hebben, tot het appartement. Het spijt me dat je geschrokken bent van een man op het dak. Het huis heeft soms onderhoud nodig. Wij proberen dat altijd te plannen als onze gasten er niet zijn. Wij hadden dat in dit geval even moeten checken, excuses daarvoor.<br/>Fijn dat je het ondanks alles prettig hebt gehad. We zijn blij dat jullie het naar jullie zin gehad hebben. <br/>Jammer dat jullie het onpraktisch vonden naar de stad te gaan.<br/>Een Uber brengt je in 5 minuten naar de gratis veerpont achter het centraal station, die 24/7 elke 5 minuten vaart.

5516496,"Dear Mark, sorry you felt that the bathroom was too tiny for your wishes. Everything is clearly stated in the advertisement and shown in the photos before booking. Wow, youre amazing review puts a big grin on my face. Thank you! : ) Thank you so much for this beautiful review. Makes my heart swell : )<br/>Hope to see you back again in future Thank you Holly for this fantastic review. <br/>Really hope to meet you some time in the future.<br/>Billie, Bram and Marieke Hi Daniel,<br/><br/>Thank you so much for the beautiful review. Paolo Conte was a gift from two Italian guests, but it does fit well, indeed. Maybe next time we can brainstorm about magazine contents (I have a crazy idea to have a lot of women draw mountainbikes out of their head, and put all the tiny (funny) results on one page, but I don't know how serious the content of the magazine is...) <br/>It was great meeting you and Antje, and I really hope to see you again.  Thank you sweeties! Thank you so much for writing this beautiful review! Thank you for the beautiful review! Hope to see you again here or in Brussels"
5527871,It was a pleasure hosting you and Amy. We love that you had such and amazing stay and happy that we could contribute to it. Welcome any time in the future! And thank you for taking such good care of our home. Merci
5615186,"Thank you Duncan! Thank you Hayden! And I will aks it earlier, before one chooses my apartment, so you are right! I did not count with an arrival at about 6pm that day. Thank you for your patience. Nice to read that you liked my place Chelsea! Thank you very much Jessica! Thank you Maggie! Thank you Kaytlin. Not everyone likes the decoration (see the bad comment below ;)) I will make some new fotos so that people know what they can expect! No lo pod√≠a creer ley√©ndolo. Siempre limpio mi departamento (y seguro que s√≠ tambi√©n el ba√±o). Mis colchones son nuevos y de la categor√≠a m√°s cara. La s√°banas siempre son lavadas. El dormitorio tiene cortinas. Nunca nadie se ha quejado sobre las cortinas. Y s√≠, mi armario es m√≠o pero tambi√©n hay espacio en otro armario y hay suficientes perchas para colgar la ropa (en realidad el √∫nico punto que podr√≠a mejorar; dejar m√°s espacio para la ropa, gracias). Y, lo siento que la decoraci√≥n no os haya gustado. Voy a poner nuevas fotos para que la gente sepa lo que pueden esperar. <br/><br/>In English; never have had a bad comment like this. Better read all the other comments which are more realistic I think. Think I neither would like to receive this guests again. Really hope for better in the future. I do all my best te clean and make my apartment as confortable as possible. Thank you very much. Thank you very much Ted. You are toooo kind! Thank you Beth! Thank you Jessi!!! Grazie!!!!

5622526,"Thanks pete for the great review. And the feedback, so sorry to hear about the musquitos!  We never hear Jan complaining, so maybe indeed it was the weather? But definitely we will buy another big musquito net for his room as well -;) Thank you so much for being great guests! It was an honour to invite you to our house."

I wish you would have told me, it is absolutely not like us!<br/>Anyhow, we just bought new sheets so no mistakes in the future.<br/>All the best and thanks for staying at our place! Hi Marin, thnx for the feedback - I wish you would have told me something seemed wrong with the window and the towels: I could have easily given you new ones and the window does close, but with a little bit of force - it is how these windows work. <br/>Happy that you had a good time, happy holidays and all the best for the new year!!"

5721466,"Lenaig and her family stayed for two weeks in house during our summer holiday. Based on how she left the house after her stay we only can conclude that she used of our property as if it was her own. Also she took good care of our cat as she was super relaxed after we returned home. I highly recommend Leaning as a guest.<br/>Wilfried"

5750100,"Thanks for your honest review Colin. <br/>The food we left in the fridge is also for guest use: herbs/mostard/jam/ketjap manis and beers/wines. <br/>Purely for guests to use it and to refill it later.  <br/>However good point to re consider this. <br/>As we notice now for some guests an empty fridge has a preference! Lovey to have hosted you. Feel welcome to come again. It was a real pleasure for us! Thanks Rochelle! And do come back: welcome any time! Thanks for your lovely and informative review; very helpful for future visitors. Hope to host you again next time! Great that you enjoyed our house! Looking forward to your next visit!   Normally we only rent our whole house with kitchen & we are always out!<br/>These dates were not possible to book: and an exception was made for this group for their congress, and we offered our 1st floor. This was thanked for.<br/>It was clearly communicated, with photo's and approved. We provided a list of perfect restaurants round the corner. We went to a special store and provided special gluten free products. Price stayed the same due to popular dates & special breakfast. <br/> Occasionally the kitchen is excluded: priced stayed nearly the same because these specific dates were very popular, other guests were already in line..."
5750107,"Adam, as we do get requests to wash clothes from time to time I had put it in there but I took off as it provides the wrong information.  Thanks for the feedback and hope until next time! "
5878526,I was surprised about this review because I have been in touch with Raquel several times during her stay and she said that everything was okay. Of course everyone has different ideas about what is clean or not. In general people judge my place as pretty clean. I asked Raquel about what she didn‚Äôt find clean. She mentioned only a few things. I‚Äôm sorry she experienced it that way.
5884786,"Thanks for your lovely words. Loved hosting you, you and Andrew are always welcome to come back!"
5893654,"You are welcome to stay jonathan! Summer is really nice in Amsterdam. With free concerts in the Vondelpark and much more which I will tell when you come :) Ohhh Susan‚Ä¶. Behind the door! There are the hooks to put your towells! Yes it was very hot when you where there! But there are two fans Ruby. You must have missed the one who‚Äôs in the cupboard . Thank you because I realize i have to tell people. And thank you for staying :) yes there are these stairs Riley. And not as steep as most stairs in Amsterdam. These are easy ones for us. Anyway, it's just on what you are used to. Thanks for staying! Yes! It was hot!! We have had the most hot days since ages while you where here! Thanks for staying! Thank you Shelley :). Amsterdam is an old city. most staircases are much, much steeper and more narrow then mine. My stairs are large and broad for us as this is a luxurious build house.I was thinking about putting images upstairs from the ordinary stairs in Amsterdam houses to show how lucky you are with these stairs. Anyway, it is just on what you know and what you are used to.  Dear Emily, When I made the incheck to your friend who came much earlier I told her to ask me if you need anything. I do this to everybody. And when I am not there there is my brother or sister in law in the same building to help. This is not only told but also mentioned in the book. So that is really a pity that this was not communicated to you by your friend. Nobody needs to be or is cold in this nice apartment ! <br/>Then for the stairs; yes they are there. And for us they are large and not steep. We climb them with baby's and luggage together in our arms and even my mother, now 90 has no problems with it. So you who are still young is just not used to it.<br/>Then next time the best is to rent out a modern house with escalator. But Amsterdam center is build with beautiful historical houses like mine and there are always the stairs. In all houses. There are stair cases from 70 cm broad with an angle that when  you go down you prefer to do it backwards. I think that I have to make a photo reportage to show how lucky you are to climb these stairs of mine :).  You are always welcome Mike ! Thank you Arthur! You are always welcome! Merci Coralie. Oui, pour 4 personnes c' est juste. C'est pour ca que je loge que a 3 personnes :). THIRD floor :) ! The stairs in this manor house are not steep... comparing to all houses in Amsterdam. Really! I think that I will put some images from the common stairs which are in Amsterdam once you get up. They are steeper and much smaller. Than you feel so lucky. Anyway- yes it is true there are stairs to climb. With a normal good health there is no problem at all and it is more a positive work out. Hi Juan, thank you so much for your comment! Between all these people who are renting there place it is important to have a review. Perhaps i'll see you again one day, it would be really nice! Please tell all your friends that they can have a nice stay at my place... best wishes, Joke"
6006984,With pleasure! Always welcome to return! Thank you Daniel for the kind review
6029168,"Thanks for your extensive review. I am not going to argue. Just let me say: this is not your typical bland, dime a dozen airbnb apartment, but a real place where real people actually live. Take your time to read some other reviews (only 5 star reviews). If you want a hotel, please by all means get a hotel. Prices are steep in Amsterdam, true, but mine is competitively priced for what you are getting. I do feel the complaint about the sound is not justified. The apartment is especially soundproof, maybe one of the neighbors across the street had a party going one of the night Ariel stayed, but in the ten years I live here I never heard so much as a beep from the neighbors upstairs or down. Of course, this is Amsterdam and not the countryside."
6057160,"Dear Montse, this is the first negative review I have received in over 10 years as an Airbnb host and I take it seriously. It is very important to me that my guests have a great experience at my place which is why I offered you a refund.<br/>Many groups of 3 guests have been very happy with their stay at my place and left positive reviews.  The single sofa-bed is brand new and is firm, like a futon, but in response to your review, I have now provided an extra topper mattress for those who find it too firm. <br/>My kitchen appliances are standard size and while most are new, some are used (as you would expect as I live here with my daughter) but in good condition; there is no TV (my listing does not claim one) but there certainly is central heating and a washing machine. Thanks a lot for the nice review, Lucy<br/>best<br/>richard"
6063077,"Daniele and his lovely wife stayed over at my place and they were very easy to communicate with. They were also very clean and tidy,  they left the place the way they found it!<br/>I would welcome them back anytime and can recommend them to any future host!<br/>Thanks again guys :)"

6101182,"Hi Keighly! Thank you for leaving such thorough feedback on your stay in the apartment. I'm glad that your overall stay was enjoyable but sorry to hear the host service let you down with slow communication and an inconvenient check-in experience. I will be leaving detailed feedback for the host service on your experience, and will be unlikely to use them again. Meanwhile I will also use your comments to enhance my listing. Thanks again for choosing to stay with me, and I hope your trip to Amsterdam was everything you'd hoped for. Hi Norman, I'm really pleased to hear you had an enjoyable stay in my apartment and in Amsterdam. Your review is very kind and I appreciate hearing about ways I can improve my guests' experience. I will take every opportunity to enhance my apartment's listing based on your feedback. Thank you again for choosing to stay with me!"

6127483,"Dryer and tub are fixed Wifi is always stable. Guest had a really old laptop and telephone, so that may be the problem. Room is not small. When the window is closed you hear nothing, there is 5 cm thick special soundproof glass in the window and there is a good ventilation system for fresh air in the room.   The centre is 10-15 min by bike. Taxi is about 15 euro from Leidseplein. There are also nightbuses the whole night takes only 10 min. Thanks! There is indeed a great Turkish breakfast buffet across the street. There are many places nearby to have breakfast. And 3 big supermarkets around the corner.  It was not me, I was sleeping somewhere else<br/> :). It is in the houserules to be quiet, so it is a pity that the guests that slept in another room were a bit noisy.  Avinash and his friends were terrible guests. They left a big mess in the room, everywhere  was garbage, all the sheets were wet and there was tea and coffee on the floor everywhere. Don't accept this guest in your house! <br/><br/>Ps. The size of the room is just as described in my add. <br/> The livingroom i dont ususally share. I left the door open as an extra service without extra charge because i was on holiday. About the tv channels, that could have been easily fixed, the plug was out in the other room/  Hey Matt, thanks for your nice review! I bought a router (and took out the wifi extender) and the signal is strong now in every room !  Should have done it earlier :).  Maybe there was a problem with my provider that weekend but I just checked the speed on my laptop and I have 18 MB internet in that room so the WIFI is good now. There is WIFI extender in the hallway.  Fridge is in the wardrobe :).  I do not recognize this at all. Everything is clean in my place. I have hundreds of satisfied guests. The kitchenette has to be kept clean by the guests themselves. I sleep there myself never have this problem....guess you are a ight sleeper? Tram 7 that leaves  right in front of my apartment takes you in 16 minutes to the citycentre  (Leidseplein), not half an hour.  Bus 21 takes you in 10 minutes  to the centre (Jordaan area).  From Schiphol airport it is only 11 minutes to station Amsterdam Sloterdijk. Then  only 1 stop with bus 15 and you are right in front of the apartment! My cleaner changed the sheets. I checked the sheets and they were clean, but gave them new ones anyway. Alper, the room is 13 m2, not 10.  I offered your girlfriend to stay until 18.00 instead of 12.00 for 25 euro extra for 2 persons, but you did not want that, so you did not pay anything extra. And I don't know what time you checked out because I was not home that day. Normally I never charge extra for a late check out. <br/><br/>I never ask extra money for an early check in. "

6192042,"Ha Bruno, bedankt voor je reactie! Natuurlijk had ik een tweede deken kunnen regelen, die liggen klaar. En de douche, dat is een trucje. Het is een redelijk ingenieuze douche, dus dat is de buis weer terug stoppen in de stand en dan is die weer aangesloten aan de douchekop, zoals beschreven in de tips van het boothuis . Had ik wellicht beter moeten communiceren. Dus bedankt voor de feedback! Volgende keer beter... Sally, so annoying to hear that the stay at the boathouse was not optimal by the Internet. There was a complete failure at the provider with the result that the Internet there uitlag. Unfortunately, acts of God, but no less annoying. Sorry again."
6206405,"Hello Henry, good to hear you had a pleasant stay. <br/><br/>The renovation of the apartments opposite our boat took us by surprise. We were not informed about it, but so far there was no inconvenience from the activities. Although this situation is beyond our control, we are sorry."

6250938,"Hey Christopher! I am glad you had good time. Pity that we could not meet this time. For september: I am not sure about my schedule yet. But once you know the dates lets get in touch. Worst case we make sure that we meet this time. All the best, D."
6299692,"Wat jammer dat je mijn huis als ‚Äòver‚Äô van het centrum hebt ervaren en beschreven. Op de fiets ben je in 15 minuten op het Leidseplein, hartje stad‚Ä¶ Mijn USP: Quietness and the city life (zie de titel van mijn advertentie üòâ). I'm a bit surprised about this review: Cindi never asked me for a second sleeping accommodation. There is a real Japanese futon (a thick one) in the big box in the small room, she should haves asked me. And the couch in the living room can be pulled out into a sofa bed as well. There are coat hangers for your clothes, and there is a huge fridge for your food. What a pity she didn't communicate about this. I have a rack with hangers for clothes but indeed no separate closet and no microwave. A microwave I don‚Äôt want to have. If you ask me in advance I can always make some space for your clothes in my closet. Dear future guests: please read my advert. The way Ricardo puts it, it's like I have been hiding things. In my advert I tell you that my house is on the 4th floor with no elevator. I also tell (and show) you that the (modern) bathroom is small. The shower is behind a wall, so normally the rest of the bathroom shouldn't get wet... Last but not least: I do tell that my house is in a quiet, green neighbourhood, 10 minutes walk from tram, bus and underground, 15-20 minutes by bike to the Van Gogh Museum, which is in the city centre. So please: if you want a house in the buzz of the town with an elevator and a huge bathroom, book another flat. That will keep everybody happy! You are completely right: I'll make a mirror in the bathroom! And I saw the reshuffle of Ganesh (I was in India two years ago): thanks.  Thanks James. I think you had bad luck with the tram; normally it takes only 10 minutes to the Stedelijk Museum and 10 minutes to the Utrechtsestraat and the canals. Just for you (and others) to know: Central Amsterdam is divided in Amsterdam Centrum, Amsterdam Oost, Amsterdam West, Amsterdam Noord en Amsterdam Zuid. Amsterdam stretches far beyond that. My neighborhood ('Rivierenbuurt') is part of Amsterdam Zuid. "

It is incomprehensible that you stay for 5 days in my apartment and you didn't let me know or reported me about everything you stated.<br/>On my Airbnb site ''page'' note, I stated very clearly that is very important to know that I have my own room where I will stay. I would ask you in the future wherever you go to stay to read carefully the house rules from the host how are going to host you and before checking in for 5 days to contact the host on WhatsApp that it could be everything under control. <br/>Thank you forward for your understanding,<br/>Kind regards,<br/><br/>Micha Mitrovic Thanks so much for staying in our apartment. you were great guests.<br/>Thank you for taking the time to write such a lovely review.

6461575,"Hi Camilla, <br/>Thank you for taking the time to write us a review and give feedback regarding your stay! However I do not agree with you in the lack of response as we updated you on the day of your check in that we had a new wifi username and password. After you asked us the wifi credentials, we send it to you another 2 times right away. Please check the messaging thread, so you can see it for yourself...Furthermore we even send you a compensation for this and asked if you think it is a fair compensation and if we can do anything else we can do to help you out.. <br/>Once again our apologies that your stay was not what you expected, but I do not think your review is entirely fair.. Hi Sot,<br/>Thanks for taking the time to write your message and feedback! We are really sorry for the experience you had here that was not going according to our usual standard.  After the check in we called the cleaner immediately to change the linnen for you who changed the linnen right away and removed the black spots. Judging by the pictures this cleaner indeed did not do his job well and is not cleaning here anymore!<br/>Regarding the tv, you were right as I went to the apartment and it was not working and we fixed it after your check out. <br/><br/>Once again our apologies for this experience and let me know if there is still anything we can do to make it up to you. Hi Christian, thanks for your feedback! I am glad you enjoyed your overall stay.  We have just put some roomspray in the bathroom next to fragrance sticks. Regarding the wasps, it is true that we have a lot of wasps in Amsterdam this summer, because of the heat last couple of weeks. I went to the apartment to check it out and was not able to locate a nest or even a wasp. Once again sorry for the small issues that occurred during your stay. Hi Emily, we are sorry you did not have a uniformly great experience! We try our best to fully disclose all pro‚Äôs and con‚Äôs of our studio apartment. As for the interior design: it is exactly as represented by the photographs in the listing. If you don‚Äôt like it that is okay, but it is as advertised. We also share that one of the undeniable pro‚Äôs is the extremely convenient location and the fact the studio is soundproofed. This is because we do live in a lively area and that is also clearly stated in the listing so there should be no surprises there. <br/>We are sorry you had to experience a small leak and we appreciate you notifying us. It is all repaired now!! We appreciate your feedback and although we believe some of it is not really fair we do take it into account to make sure all of our guests will enjoy staying with us. Hi Cindy, thank you so much for your stay and leaving a review! Happy to hear you enjoyed the location :) The studio is indeed located a few steps down, it's called a Souterrain and is very common for Amsterdam. We will make sure to check the studio for any bugs for the comfort of our next guests. Thanks again and hope to welcome you again! Dear Steven, <br/>We have profusely apologized for the inconvenience you had to put up with. You and your party were the subject to a series of unfortunate events, being a broken shower drain pump that shorted out the electricity, your late arrival and suboptimal communication from our hosts. We also let you know that the pump had been fixed and all issues were resolved. And therefore it seems a bit mean and vindictive to post a review like this. Our most recent guests have not experienced any issues, just like all our other guests as proven by our almost 200 4 and 5 star reviews. <br/>As mentioned before here and in our previous chats, we apologize for the inconvenience and hope you otherwise had a great stay in Amsterdam. <br/>For our future guests: as in every house, sometimes things break. We fixed it all within a day. We hope this review does not discourage you from staying with us. <br/>Kind regards, <br/>Paul Hi Nicola, I am happy to hear you had a nice stay. We will definitely take your feedback into consideration. Hope to see you soon! :)<br/> Hi Dana, thank you for your feedback. I am very glad to hear you enjoyed my apartment and our communication suited you well. I am sorry to hear about the noise. After I read your review I went home to check the door and the lights. I changed some broken light bulbs and checked the front door lock. But when I tried to lock it from the inside, and from the outside it worked as it should. Without any problems I locked my door from both ways. I hope you are happy to hear about these improvements and I hope you would visit our apartment again! Hi Dani, <br/>Thank you very much for your feedback. It will help us improve the experience for the next guests. We are taking care of the issues you noticed immediately. <br/>Kind regards, <br/>Paul&Joanna  Hi Ricardo, <br/>We are sorry that you did not have an uniformly great experience. <br/>The location of the studio is great we agree. Because it is in the souterrain level it can get a bit darker when it's cloudy. On the other hand when it is sunny there is lots of light and it stays nice and cool. <br/>We regret to hear you did not receive a mattress with the cot, you should have. <br/>In the advertisement it says there is no possibility to cook, we don't know how to state that more clearly. Also we live there ourselves with a baby and it is a very safe neighborhood, however, as stated in the description it can get busy since there are lots of restaurants and bars around. Again we regret to hear you experienced some surprises as we do our best to have our descriptions accurate as can be read in lots of the other reviews. <br/>Kind regards, <br/>Paul&Joanna  Hi Lainey! So sorry about your check-in, this isn't our usual standard and we definitely will use your feedback to improve. Glad you enjoyed the apartment and fab location :) !! Thanks for your kind words Abigail! Happy you enjoyed the location and the lovely little garden :) Take care! Hi Jahana,<br/>thanks for your feedback and review. We have not heard before of the noise problem or pictures. I guess because you stayed in the wintertime that the apartment is darker than usual, but that is unfortunately what happens in this season. For the noise, it is a very old, beautiful and monumental building in the middle of Amsterdam and it can get a little noisy here. I added it extra to the listing, just for sure! Hopefully, you still had a great time here!"

Merci thank you so much :) in my add it says that i live above the apartment, if you are to lazy to read don‚Äôt complain.<br/>sorry about the rain next time i will arrange a sunny stay. <br/>my washing machine is indeed at the same floor as the apartment, i had asked if it would be ok if i use it during the time you would spend in the city. the answer was that it was no problem. not to nice to complain about it now.<br/>please read my over 200 other reviews that are more positief then the one Diarea left me. it was a plessure hosting you and your family.<br/>welcome to come again any time.<br/>Kind regards,<br/>wanka Thank you :) :) Thank you for your perfect stay. thank you I keep a storage that has a door at the patio of the apartment, i hardly ever need to be there,.<br/>I a had some problems with my door at the front of the house and needed to get some tools.<br/>it was 2 pm and i thought the guests where out. <br/> I send my son to get the tools, when he came back he told me one of the guest was shouting at him.<br/>Pol's friend knocked at the door a view minutes later and started shouting in french and waving a knife at me,  i felt threatened.<br/> I only speak a view basic french words, all of the guest didn't speak any englisch so communicating was really hard.<br/>It was a really unpleasant experience. i have over 100 reviews please read some others and you will see that this is not me as Pol is saying here.<br/>Never did i have such terrible guests. thank You :) thank you for your nice review. to bad we did not get a change to meet.<br/>maybe nextime.<br/><br/>all the best to you and yours Thank You There is a a carpark within 2 minuut walk. maybe my son forgot to show you how to get there as i was not able to do the check in myself.<br/> a have had over a 100 stay with 4 people and had they no problem with it at all. my brother did the check in amd did not explain hoe to get to the entrence with the car.<br/>it is possible to get close to the apartment with the car.<br/><br/>regards, wanka  Leider k√∂nnen Sie nicht alle zufriedenstellen.<br/>Es war 45 Grad in Amsterdam, das mag die Stimmung dieser G√§ste beeinflusst haben.<br/>Die G√§ste w√ºrden eine Nacht auf Wunsch ihrer 18-j√§hrigen Tochter auf dem Heimweg bleiben, es war klar, dass die Eltern nicht zu ihrem Vergn√ºgen hier waren, und meiner Meinung nach sind sie sofort gegangen.<br/>Less meine anderen mehr als 150 Bewertungen und Sie k√∂nnen daraus eine Schlussfolgerung ziehen. thank you so much all the best to you amd yours welcome thank you, you are welcome  The price of ‚Ç¨32,- from or to the airport is whit Uber, this price depends on what time and day you are traveling.<br/><br/> Hi Siphelele,<br/><br/>when i came in the apartment at 6 am to take you to your bus.<br/>the apartment look like a big mess, you moved furniture around and did not put it back, dirty towels thrown on the floor, a big stain on my new duvet, behavior i see with my kids.<br/>I have not charged you for the duvet, as we degreed up on i would take it to the cleaners to see if the stain would come out. if not then i am going to charge you for it.<br/>Cleaning fee is for cleaning the apartment as in vacuuming moppen cleaning the bathroom, toilet, the beds ect. it is not for doing your dirty dishes, it's airbnb you don't get a butler with it.<br/>All the bedlinnen was clean, it always is!!!<br/>if you would have informed yourself you could have known that the regular bus goes until 00.00.<br/>There is a night bus you could have taken.<br/>This is not my responsability.<br/>I still left you a nice review. i think i was friendly to you until you did not show respect for the apartment.<br/>I did not shout at you, i did say i was pissed. thank you Kendall.<br/><br/>enjoy the rest of your stay in Europe:) :)"

6588199,"Hi Jon,<br/>Thank you for taking your time to write this review. I am fully aware of the fact we had one incident during the week you stayed in our apartment and that it was my fault it happened. Since this is the first 1-star feed back I ever get from my (almost 100) guests, I think it is good to share my view on what happened just as you have shared yours.<br/>There is a door between the apartment and my house, that only we can open from our side. Normally we tell our guests at check in that we use the door a couple of times a week, f.e. if we need something from our freezer, or if we need our racing bike. The freezer and bike are in the small hall way, from which I cannot even see the door to your bedroom/living room. So our guests know we can come in. We always knock before. We never go passed the little hall way without getting permission from the guests. Unfortunately this information was not given to you at check in. When I knocked the door, and entered the little hall way and asked if any one was home, I walked into the hall way, without being able to see your door.<br/>You were not aware that this could even happen, and were not amused, which I fully understand, and which I apologized for several times. The reason I entered was I came to see if you were doing fine and if there was anything you needed. I also wanted to talk to you about the BBQ you had during your first night in our garden, but did not get round to that. You did obviously not want to talk any more. During your first night the fire alarm went off on our 1st floor due to your BBQ, and the whole house has been smelling smoky all night. Since we do not have a BBQ in the garden ourselves, we did not understand where the smoke came from at first. When we found out, it started to rain and the BBQ was over.<br/>When I tried to get in touch with you the day after the incident, I apologised again and asked if you were okay, you did not respond to my question. I tried once more, but no response. I am therefor surprised that you complain after your stay about not having access to the garden. If I had known about this misunderstanding, I could have solved it during your stay. And since you did use the garden on your fist night, I am even more surprised.<br/>The guests in our apartment do have access to the garden, but are asked not to smoke and not to make noise after 10 P.M. This is also something we discuss with the guests on arrival. You are right the rules in the apartment were on this point different from the rules on my listing, and that is not good. I changed the house rules in the apartment. Again: if I had known this bothered you during your stay, I could have solved it. After your stay, I cannot do anything anymore.<br/>I live upstairs and I can enter the garden by using the stairs from my balcony, but as stated in the listing I never use the garden when there are guests. I did not come in to the garden while you were there, nor did anyone of my family.<br/>Regarding your privacy, I understand your concern and I would never want anyone to feel uncomfortable. Altogether, I always try my best to give the guests the best stay they can get and I feel very sorry that you did not experience this. The rating you gave seems to me to be unfair and very harsh, but I will take all your feedback into consideration so it will not happen again. I hope your overall experience in Amsterdam was good, and that you have many good memories to think back to in the coming years. All the best, Carolien It was a pleasure hosting you amy! Thanks for your kind words Oli! It was a pleasure hosting you. Thank you L√©a, it was a pleasure having you and Thomas here. Always welcome back! Best, Carolien"
6630741,Thanks Liam! So glad to hear you had an amazing time and enjoyed my place and its location. Thank you for leaving such a complete review and I am looking forward to welcoming you again!
6651424,"Dear Sandrine, thanks for your nice words and feedback! I really appreciate that. You did great on cleaning the couch. I have fixed the shower with Antikal :-)<br/><br/>I'm sorry to tell that we left you a bottle of Cava, but the host forgot the put in on the table. Maybe next time ;-) <br/><br/>Regards,<br/><br/>Ernest Hi Maria,<br/><br/>Thanks for your feedback and the lovely note!  I'm sorry that you we a bit disappointed  about the location. We don't say that our house is in the center though. The title of the add is: 'Brand new home in Amsterdam East'. I do think that the center is near. It's only 5 minutes by train or 10-15 minutes by bike. We never walk to the city center. But because of your experience, I will mention in the add that it's close with public transport or bike.<br/><br/>Welcome back any time!<br/><br/>Ernest"
6668130,"Thanks for your kind words and welcome back! Thanks Sarah for your lovely words. Heartlifting  to hear you had such a good time in our apartment. Thanks to our neighbours and good friends Erica and Jasper! thank you very much for your kind words. So happy you enjoyed everything Thanks Javier! Cheers, Erica Thanks John! Cheers, Erica Hi Michael, Thanks for the compliments! I am glad you enjoyed the wines I have in my port folio! See you again! Warmest, Erica The lights in the apartment are designed by a well known Dutch glass designer, rather low in that location because it hangs above a worktable. The price of the lamp  was 325 euro. Fortunately I could contact the designer and have him redesign the broken part, drive to Amsterdam and fit it, all for 175 euro. I feel insulted by the insinuation that I am charging too much money.  Perhaps the lighter we found in the bed had something to do with the clumsiness that resulted in the broken light.  Thankk Melissa! It was great to have you here. Always Welcome in Amsterdam. Warm regards, Erica. Thanks Ricardo! Always welcome again in Amsterdam! Warm regards, Erica Thanks!"
6673155,"Dear Ulla, <br/>I hope you are happy and that you still had a great time in Amsterdam. <br/>Please don‚Äôt judge people you don‚Äôt know. You haven‚Äôt been in my BnB and I don‚Äôt know you. <br/>You are always welcome in my bnb  but  you were too early that day and you had to wait so we could clean the room Coronaproof. Check in time minumal is 13.00 hours, but you wouldn‚Äôt or couldn‚Äôt‚Äô wait. Please blame me  for mixing up your arrival day, because of your short notice chance of dates. But the room was available for you with lots of good vibes!<br/>I wish you all the best, stay save and blessings, Ellen"
6673715,"hi benjamin.... maybe you should read better‚Ä¶<br/>1) my place is listed as  a private room and not as private  flat, how ever nobody use the kitchen downstairs.<br/>2) as i have telling you the tv is off the facilities and i apologized for having forgot to take that out the general  description thing i  ve done now<br/>3) the iron was there ,in fact you left that on the table<br/>4) the washing machine is maybe old but perfectly fontioning and clean<br/>5) my place is not aluxury place, in fact you pay a modest price comparing with the market, it is certainly  a decent b&b!!! mi dispiace che Edoardo abbia avuto problemi con le mappe , per dire la verita'non ho capito come sia successo...normalmente in 4/5 anni di attivita' e in media un paio di gruppi asettimana  e'capitato solamente un altra volta che qualcuno abbia avuto questo problema...."
6681879,"Dear Naom, I'm really sorry that you had such a disappointing experience, especially because I always receive 5 star reviews. But honestly, I told you in advance that I would be out of reach for 10 days and I arranged with two friends that they would let you in. Since you were delayed for a couple of hours yourself, you had to wait as my friends also have lives and work. One friend had to go to work and the other was still working and could only contact you later. I would like to kindly remind you that I do not own a hotel, but am renting out my own private apartment (hence the balcony, which is not in use during the winter with a couple of degrees outside) which is actually the purpose of Airbnb. A lot of people like that and feel at home in a different city. Others may prefer an anonymous hotel room or apartment. Also my bike was stolen 1 week before, like my friend told you. I would have not expected these complaints afterwards, as you did not tell my friend that you are disappointed or would like to have a bike. She could have done something about it then. Now, I can only say that I'm sorry that you were not so satisfied. At the same time, I do not really feel the review is fair. I sincerely hope that you will have a better experience next time using Airbnb. All the best, Kalina Thanks so much Shaun, really happy that you enjoyed it. For me that‚Äôs the most important :) And thanks a lot for leaving the apartment so clean! All the best, Kalina Dear Ashley, we are very happy to hear that you enjoyed your time in our apartment. Regarding the wifi and the light in the shower, we noted when we came back that one switch was off. So it would have been easily solved if had known. Anyway we hope this didn't pose too many problems. In any case we also enjoyed you having at our place. Thanks! "

6813652,"Hi Tyler, we're very sorry to read in your review that you experienced your check in a s a let-down. We use a form where you fill in your arrival details to predict your exact arrival time. As your requested arrival time was after 21:00/9pm, you paid ‚Ç¨40 extra as is agreed upon when you make the booking. After you landed you sent your host a message to inform her that you would be arriving in 40 minutes, only to message her right after that that your Uber driver was quick and you would be arriving in 10 minutes. We understand that it was inconvenient you had to wait for her, but she came to meet you right away. We experienced the communication with you as a guest as very pleasant and had the idea this was mutual from your message: ""Just for reference on the times. We arrived much earlier than we thought about 9:20, the Uber was quick.<br/>We are here though, thanks for the great communication. Things like this happen :)""<br/>We are very surprised by your review, but we're happy to see that still enjoyed Annemaries' apartment. Unfortunately you left your nicest words about it for the private feedback: ‚ÄúApartment was lovely and we had a great time."""

Even we had a leak in the bathroom, we're glad we could make you feel comfortable and accommodated in a way which made you happy.<br/>We're proud hosts and love the service industry.<br/>A'dam Good Story, a great story born in Amsterdam Merci!<br/>I try to keep Amsterdam affordable with my cosy set-up.<br/>Just off Bijlmer ArenA station, next to the shopping mall is ideal for a family or a group of friends. I always try to make sure my guest have this kind of experience as it's best for everybody to have fun.<br/>Much appreciated they enjoyed the stylish place and the pictures! It's better for some to read listings carefully Thanks thanks Martha for your stay and your trust.<br/>it was great to host you guys It was more then a pleasure to host you.<br/>Very intersting conversations and mutual respect it's all it takes. Kids open their heart, so do I.<br/>Thanks for the stay! Spot on! Hosting must be in your DNA Great! It takes 2 to Tango. Thanks for the great review and it also goes for you! Thanks for the review. I always make sure the location and appartement are fine for you so they are a 5 star experience. It's the little things in life that makes the difference. People think hosting is putting it online ... that's only where it starts ;) It was very nice to host the first cyclists family.<br/>Was happy you could relax a bit after your hard work Friendly guest recieve a friendly host ;) It's always pleasant to host a family with the stylish bunk bed. Young or old, we love to host anybody from any age! Great to see happy people, we believe whatever you do, do it with your hart My pleasure, I like to make my guest comfortable Thank you very much. I keep trying to make the best experience. Thanks Imke, you were great guests Merci beaucoup. The next time you stay with me in Kazachstan ;) An all 5-star review except for the location.<br/>I always make the effort to contact my guest before I accept the booking to make sure this isn't an issue ... So why a 4-star on the location?<br/><br/>From here you reach many points in the city faster and Have easy access to tram, metro, bus, train airport en even the beach! Everything you do as a hobby is fun! Love to make you feel at ease in my area. A little outside the city but just that much more comfortable. Loved the place! We were a party of three woman on a business trip, we took few days before the meetings to visit Amsterdam since it was the first time visiting Nederland. Joek went above and beyond to accommodate our early arrival, greeted us with fresh fruits and gave some wonderful tips to move around. His place is perfect, spotless and comfortable; as a bonus away from tourists but well located to easily move back and forth using public transportation. Communicating with him was very easy and the checking in and out process couldn‚Äôt be easier. I am not sure if Amsterdam will be a destination again, but if I happened to return I will definitively stay at Joek‚Äôs place again, he is a great host. Always good to have happy guests, see you next time! Always good to have a review with some feedback.<br/>There is a walkaround around the bed, just via the door into the bathroom. I hope the pictures are clear enough.<br/>The beds are exactly so you can situp straight. Maybe if you're above the standards not but I'm 1,80 meter and can sit up straight on the lower and upper bed.<br/>But indeed it's a bit weird for a couple as there is a bed above you.<br/>I started the renovation and changed some things around for comfort so a big thanks for beeing flexible. In my drive to perfection I'm always looking how to optimise the guest space. <br/>I have recently expanded the place and so I'm looking what the best way is to put the furniture around.<br/>Lovely review, feel free to stay again! Always good to have happy guest! WoW, this is too many compliments ... I try to make everybody happy when they open their hart! Niquel, it's a new word to me but I appreciate it very much! Merci! Reading the review makes me happy. I always try to achieve a 5 star review.<br/>People who book are aware of my location as this reflects in my price.<br/><br/>In the Corona time I dropped my rate to the bare minumum but it didn't seem low enough for Sandrine. Maybe a room would be the best for her to rent next time. I host a lot of people for the first time on Airbnb as I like to set the standard high ;)<br/>Thanks Marco, it was a pleasure! With some people you connect, with some people you have a spark. Thanks Jasko, I will considder to join you at the October fest. Peace! Lovely review! Small note, I rent max 3 adults but their bf came unexpected. Dank je wel Marius, groetjes aan je lieve dames. Thanks, very good info: 800m to the station where you can use train, bus and metro. 300 m to Lidl supermarket and just 50m to the closest supermarket. Lidl accept all cards (Visa, Mastercard and Amercian Express). 600m to the big park where you can walk, run and do all kind of excercise, including a big skatepark and big kids playground. Thanks Always good to have great guest. As stated in my listing, it's up to my guest how much you interact with me. <br/>Marina and George were very enthusiastic and had visited Amsterdam before so it was very easy to have some great talks. Thanks guys! Fraaie mille Lovely review, thanks! you're welcome A studio is a 1 bedroom appartment. The overview picture shows you exactly how the space is. Thanks for your stay. It takes two to tango. If you open your hart, I open mine! This is how it is; thank you very much for appreciating my service. Thanks for your visit. The T.V. is available at all times, just need to ask. All my guest are busy exploring the city and so I might get a request or 2 per year. I provide loads of free tips for the city but you need to take a moment to chat. Amsterdam can be very expensive but my accommodation is one of the cheapest if not the cheapest, even when you book a year in advance.<br/>Last but not least, a 17 minute metro ride in another city will get you nowhere. Amsterdam is just a little postcard and 17 minutes on the metro is not far out, it's just next to the Johan Cruijff Arena. Location is a bit out as I always make clear but unfortunately I can't make Elton John perform ... Merci! grand merci pour la belle critique It takes 2 to tango. Very nice family who loved to share the food. Thanks for the review. grande beijo Big thanks! I try to make it as comfortable as possible and help where I can. merci :) Momo really enjoyed to meet you! There must be a first for everything as I live in a very nice and quiet area.<br/>The only shady thing was Christina, sneaking in a friend to stay for 3 night without booking for this. Please look to my other reviews. I do my best and your experience in Amsterdam reflects on my booking, so I help were I can. Aver plaisir :) We had a great time! Unfortunately Julia had to leave unexpected and we they could only stay for 1 night ... next time more wine and talks! Thank you so much, we'll meet again! Merci! Great review! Thanks Lissi, I can speak Danish now thanks to Google Translate!<br/> I was happy to host them for 1 night . wow, stunning review Thanks, what an amazing review ... sometimes I'm surprising myself! It's so beautiful t get a French review, in matter of fact, any review in your native language makes me happy. Merci, Merci ... avec plaisir ;) I can help you with everything ... I hope! The strawberries are not standard, only for special girls ;) If you open up to me ... I do my best to make your stay perfect! It takes two to tango and solo travellers are more open to the conversation! Grainne explained that this is the best Irish review I can get ... I'll taker her word for it :) As a host I'll try to assist where I can. just friendly ;) Thanks but I like to know how it can take you more then 10 minutes to the metro.<br/>The price of the studio is a very cheap as it is a private studio with a kitchen and your private toilet and shower. Thans Nikita! spot on Austrian review! Great and acurate review, my first one from Hong Kong.  A big kiss, what a lovely review ;)<br/> The first Italian written review, Great! I love it when people make the reference in their native language! He has a great twin brother!<br/> Thanks, so nice!<br/> Yeah, first German review!!!<br/> still beeing cool at 42 ... sounds good!<br/> yeah , great review in Chinese!!<br/> Great to see those reviews, keep them coming ;)<br/> It takes two to tango!!  thanks for the personnal feedback you see, some people only need 5 minutes to the metro :)<br/> Check-in or check-out are pretty flexible, you can alway drop off you luggage early or pick it up late.<br/> the Studio is fully equiped and gives you perfect privacy. There are noises which I try to reduce and I'm aware of. Perfection is my goal and every time I try to improve the place ... step by step.<br/> thanks, cleaned to perfection ;) Thanks!!<br/> Come back anytime Good to hear Let's meet the friend ;)<br/> the walk from here to the metro takes 7 minutes without kids or with kids when you bring a buggy along. Too many compliments in 1 review :) Suitable for any travel, with a car or without For people who just want a place to stay or looking for an active host who love to help to plan your trip. Great to host business people. More then welcome anytime<br/> it takes two to Tango! It's an ongoing process I'm only happy when you are!"

Thank you Dana, you were an amazing guest! Communication was smooth, the apartment was left in great condition and the house rules were respected. I hope to host you again in the future! Hoi Wesley, bedankt voor het delen van je ervaring met onze Classy Room accommodatie. Het spijt ons om te horen dat je het idee gekregen hebt dat Evert slecht bereikbaar is, aangezien zijn standaard hierin juist heel hoog is. Ook de reden dat hij al erg lang Superhost is :) Voor dit soort gevallen zijn wij, Rental Valley, overigens ook altijd beschikbaar, waarvoor je onze contactgegevens ontvangen hebt. Voor een volgende keer, dit soort situaties vallen eigenlijk altijd wel snel op te lossen :) Groetjes, Nadine - Team Rental Valley Hi Rita, thanks for your feedback. How sad to hear you had troubles with the stairs. Actualy the stairs is pretty wide for Amsterdam concepts. Because the spiral, the part where it turns is smaller, maybe that gave the trouble. If you find a spiral staircase a next time, make sure to stay at the side of the banisters, there it's the widest and you'll have good grip.<br/>About the kitchen facilities: there are not much kitchen facilities indeed. But I'm suprised you expected it, because you booked a room, not an apartment. In the add, we clearly say that there is no kitchen, only a coffee machine, water boiler and refrigerator. If you like to stay at a place with a kitchen, it's best to book an apartment instead of a room or look if the room has a kitchen, sometimes it has. I hope this tips will help you to improve your next trip somewhere via Airbnb.  Hi Marty, Thank you for your review! You are very kind. I enjoyed being your host. You were great guests! All the best, Evert Hi Joanna, <br/>I am very  happy you enjoyed your stay. Yo have been great guests! I hope to be able to welcome you again in the future. <br/>Best wishes, Evert  Hi Melissa,  Thank you for choosing my Airbnb-flat! I  am happy you enjoyed your stay in Amsterdam. The fridge has now been replaced with a brand new one and it is so quiet, it does not make any noise! You are  always welcome back to stay again in the future! Bye! Evert  Hi Fuaad, I enjoyed being your host and I am happy you liked my cat Schnautz.  I hope you had a good journey home on the ferry! That is a great way to travel! Thank you for your visit! Bye! Evert   <br/>Dear Shaun,<br/><br/><br/>Sorry to read you did not enjoy your stay in Amsterdam and experienced issues with BnB's throughout Europe. Nevertheless, even BnB owners need a holiday every now and then. But rest assured, you stayed in my home and not in a vacant property. <br/><br/>Both Manon and I have communicated extensively through Airbnb, throughout your entire stay. I understood from Manon that you were unable to use your telephone. This may have been a reason why our communication was not ideal. Since you checked out of another property in Amsterdam quite early, you requested an early check in/luggage drop-off and late check out. We met with both requests and Manon was there for check in as agreed at 2 PM. That was the earliest possibility. It is unfortunate that you had to wait and in the meantime your suitcase got stolen, after you left it on the sidewalk unattended with a note attached to it. <br/><br/>In your comments, you could have taken note of the fact that Manon spent her afternoon to go to the police station with you, to report the theft of your suitcase. And of our offer to use the washing machine to meet your lack of having clothes to wear.<br/> <br/>The price of this room is much less than a comparable hotel room and we try to give our guests privacy. That this is not appreciated in this case is new to us, but we will consider your comments (both the public and private ones). <br/><br/>We sincerely hope you will have more positive experiences on your further travels through Europe. <br/><br/>Regards,<br/><br/>Evert Allison and her husband have been great guests. They left the room in perfect order and are welcome back any time! Thomas was a fine guest. Welcome back any time! Hi Oleg! Thank you for your review! You were wonderful guests. Thank you for the Chocolates from L√ºbeck! Take care, Evert  Hi Rachel, Thank you for your review! You were great guests and I enjoyed being your host. You are always welcome back of course !!  <br/>Best wishes, Evert  Hi Jennifer, Thanks so much for your appreciation and for your review. I enjoyed  having you as guests! Hope to be able to host you again in the future! Take care, Evert Hi Jacky!  Thank you very much for your super-review! You are really very kind. I am happy you enjoyed staying at my place and I hope we meet again in the future! Best! Evert Thank you Carlota. I hope to meet you and Christophe again. I hope you had a nice time in Ouddorp. Bye, Evert  Hi Kees and Malu,  I was happy to be able to host you and I am happy you enjoyed your stay. You have been  great guests and you are welcome any time! Best wishes, Evert  Thank you Thomas! I really enjoyed being your host. I am glad you had a good time. Hope to  meet again! Bye,  Evert "
7181185,"Honestly, I found this review a little soul destroying. Almost all of our reviews are 5* The weather was really terribly hot - 35 degrees. I brought a portable air conditioner from my house and a flat cotton sheet to really help these guests be comfortable in this unusual heat, in addition to our usual Dyson fan. The guests wanted to drop bags between 3 and 4 so I duly waited in for them, but arrival was at 5pm. I stayed to give them a warm welcome. I don‚Äôt understand how they were upset that it took me two  minutes to answer the front door. I really did everything I could to be a great host. have a beautiful old house ‚ù§Ô∏è thanks so much for the lovely feedback and for being great guests!

Aw, so glad, thanks for the kind words Ellie ‚ò∫Ô∏è I‚Äôm so sad to see a 3* rating - it‚Äôs our 2nd ever in 7 years and from over 200+ guest stays. Our average is 5*, and we aim for this every time and every stay, even if only for 1 night.<br/>I try really hard to give a warm experience for all guests. 1 night stays when the guest arrives late in the evening and leave early the next morning naturally make for less of a connection. I will review whether to continue with enabling 1 night stays üíÜüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Thanks so much Danielle ‚ô•Ô∏è It‚Äôs easy to be a great host with such lovely guests.

7260685,"Hi Rachel,<br/>Thank you for your lovely feedback, you are always welcome to return! How sad to hear your travelling partner did not sleep well. The second bed has the size of a traditional double bed ( 190cmx140cm), while the other bed is Queen size ( 190x160). I will make sure to add this information to the site for future guests, thank you for feedback."
7261788,"Hi Suleman, We are a bit surprised you mentioned the stairs, because in our listing we clearly state, that if you have a problem taking 4 flights of stairs this accommodation is probably not suited for you. What more do you want us to do?<br/>As for heating, we are surprised even more, because during the check in procedure I explained to you to send me a message if you want a higher room temperature and when it becomes too hot just to close the radiatorvalve. Apparantly this worked out well when reading back our communication via the Airbnb messageboard. <br/>At the end of your stay you wrote everything was super perfect about the accommodation. Keeping this in mind, this leaves us confused after reading your review.<br/>In general, we attach great value in the quality of our accommodation. The photos with accompanying text together with the listings description will give a reliable and accurate overview of the accommodation. Hi Chris, Thanks for your feedback. Much appreciated. The safetylocks on the window can be removed on request for good reasons as described by you. As for the shower, the ceramic valve works perfect if the valve has been closed properly. In general it would be better to contact me during your stay and not at the end, because only after feedback we can do something about it, especially when it comes to matters that can be easily solved. Hi Katia, Thanks for your feedback. Much appreciated! One remark though: the bathroom (this is the shower only) is strictly private, only to be used by you. The toilet in de gangway on the same floor is the only amenity shared with the other guestroom. Thanks again. Greetings, Wilbert Hi Vincent, Thanks for your review. Much appreciated!

Hope to see you again Thank you so much David, great to hear you enjoyed. <br/>You are very happy to visit us again. <br/>Hope Belgium was nice and thank you again. Thank you so much! Very appreciated. We were very happy with you as guests. Hope to welcome you again. Thank you Arnaud for staying with us. Merci beaucoup pour choisir notre appartement Hi James, thank you for choosing our apartment. You are always welcome to come again. Hi david, thank you for choosing our apartment. It was great having you here. Always welcome again. Hi Ulrike,<br/><br/>Thank you for your review. Hope to welcome you again. Hope you had a wonderful time.<br/> Jessie, I am really disappointed by your negative comments on the sleeping rooms of the children. First of all do you understand what airbnb is? It is to rent your private house to foreigners who wants to have a local feeling and not choosing a vacation apartment or hotel. I really do not understand that if you see the pictures in the description, what is not responding to the reality. I think you have to high expectations and you had to choose a 5 star hotel instead of a family private house/ apartment. <br/>I think your comments are very subjective as some families/guests loved our house. In the description and pictures, you could see the high sleepers and so you could decide to take another apartment at airbnb. I would give you an advice that you could better choose for a hotel instead of an private house of locals. I think your comments are very insulting for our house. I wish you all the best. Hi, <br/>I am so sorry to hear that the toilets did not worked properly. The water pipe company of Amsterdam broke something, so the whole street had this problem last friday. Exactly the day you arrived. We did not know, but you could have informed us, so we could do something about this. It is working properly again. We found out this problem also yesterday, the day you left. About the pricing, I do not know...we rent our appartment during the monday - friday for 250 and in the weekend a bit more.<br/>Our pricing is obvious and clear and when you book you see the total price. So it should not be a surprise or misleading.  Thank you so much! It was really a pleasure to be our guests in our house! Very nice experience with you. I hope you will come back again...hope you had a wonderfull stay! thank you christina, you were also very nice guests...You are so warm and so friendly and an adorable baby boy you have! I hope you will come back if you will visit Amsterdam...it was great to have you here, I wish all my guests were such beautiful personality as you are...I hope you are safe now in Brussel and hope to hear from you. You are so welcome! Really lovely people you are! Thank you so much Lucy, you were so lovely! I wish I could show you more things about Amsterdam...Thank you for being my guests in my apartment. Love to hear from you again and you are so welcome to come back again!<br/> Kristoffer was a very nice guest, I would love to have him back! Really nice and serieus people. So nice to have them"

7570689,"Hola Javier, muchas gracias por tu gran rese√±a, una cosa es un misterio para m√≠: ¬øla ropa de ba√±o vieja? ¬øTe refieres a la toalla vieja que est√° en el ba√±o para el piso? Porque las toallas para los invitados se compraron este a√±o... Thank you, I'l talk to Bonnie ;) Liebe Leonie, <br/>es tut mir wirklich leid, dass dich die Stra√üenbahn gest√∂rt hat beim einschlafen, aber dar m√∂chte ich noch hinzuf√ºgen, dass die Stra√üenbahnen in Amsterdam um Mitternacht ihre letzte Fahrt anfangen. <br/>Und aufgrund von Bauarbeiten ist diese Strecke jetzt zwar belebter, das ist tempor√§r, aber leider ist dies jetzt der Fall.<br/>Nat√ºrlich bleibt es ein Zimmer am Rande der Stadt, in dem Tag und Nacht gelebt wird.<br/>Vielen Dank f√ºr dein sch√∂nes Kompliment f√ºr die Einrichtung und daf√ºr, dass mann sich da wohl f√ºhlt, gro√üartig.<br/>Ich hoffe, Ihr Aufenthalt hier ist doch eine positive Erinnerung. Thank you for your feedback Maureen. I am sorry to read you did not sleep well. I would like to add though, that the days you were here have been the hottest May days EVER, hotter than a normal summer!<br/>All three (large) windows have a vertical vent stand, that usually cools the room sufficiently during the night, and also keeps the noise down to a minimum, when you close the curtains.  However, when you open all windows horizontal, in the door stand, you are basically letting in all air AND sound from the street, also because you couldn't draw the curtains this way. It is a difficult situation, but your suggestion of the availability of a fan is a good one!<br/> Thank you for your lovely review Alice, but I would like to add that it was officially (!) the hottest days of the century! in Amsterdam when you were here. In general, when you keep the -light blocking- curtains closed when away during a hot summer's day, heat is under control. So sorry to have missed the opportunity to write you a review! It was ever so easy to host you and Gustavo, thanks again for staying with us, do come again :-) Thank you both, and do come again! Thank you Sarah for your kind words. I am so sorry to have missed the opportunity to write you a review, it's been a busy period :‚Ç¨<br/>But! If anyone should ask for a personal note on your guest status I will happily supply the 5-star certificate :-) it was a joy to have you and Morgan over!  Thank you Scott, it was a pleasure hosting you and Sylvia. Unfortunately I just missed my opportunity to review you as a guest, a five star guest is my opinion! All the best, wilma :-) thank you, and Bonnie definitely loved hanging out with you too! ;-) Hi Iliana, I am sorry I missed the opportunity to write you a review! I can only ad: you and Harry were ever so easy to host, and fun to be with :-) thank you again for staying with us. :-) thank you John, really nice to know you had such a good time. And do come back some time! Next time we do a pancake evening to start with ;-) looking forward to it! Thank you for staying Kat, I enjoyed having you here! All the best, W Thank you for your kind words, and I am sorry to hear you were woken up before you meant to. It must have been a Playstation morning on the weekend, without using the headphones! My apologies, the headphones are a must in the morning, until about 9 o'clock. Being a car mad 8-year old is no excuse ;-) Thank you Aviya for your kind words, but I do feel I have to clarify a few things you mention, for future reference.<br/>You were here during the week, on schooldays, when we have breakfast and get ready to go out, between 7:15 and 8:15 in the morning. I am sorry to hear you were woken up by this, a few times, and did not mention anything while you were here. We were unaware of causing 'noise'.<br/>Also, your early night must have been before 8:30pm, as our son is usually in bed by then, another floor up. We could not have guessed we were keeping anybody up at that time. But again, we were unaware, and just going about our daily life routine, and I am sorry if you feel disappointed in any way.<br/>Our home is definitely a family home, including a cat, as proudly mentioned on the outline of the room, but also in my personal profile. Cat lovers did book ;-) but she is not allowed in the guest room. Yes! That was a bit tricky, when you were here in November the staircase handrail was positioned on the right, but the wall didn't really support any pulling. That is dealt with: Now there is a full length handrail on the left side, bolted into a brick wall, safe and sound. (I will post a picture) But -and I would like to stress- it still is the original straight up Dutch staircase, and you best carry several small suitcases or bags, instead of one big one... Sorry guys, the stairs were mentioned, and you did an incredible job there ;-) well done Udhav! I have fond memories of your stay, thank you and all the best to both of you!"
7591797,"Happy to hear this, thanks so much! Feel free to come back any time! Wow, almost everything in this review, except from the fan part, is a lie or overdone. I‚Äôve never heard about these problems in the 3 years I am a host now. I am sorry that you ‚Äòsuffered‚Äô, but if it was so bad that you felt the urge to treat my house and my privacy disrespectful, you should have told me, like I suggested. We would have arranged something later on. Seems to me like you wrote this review to hide your own rude and disrespectful behavior. <br/>This is how it actually is: I gave you 4, not 1 bath towels of good quality (that you all ruined with weird stains that don‚Äôt come out so I can throw away, which you refuse to pay for). There‚Äôs nothing wrong with the pillows of linens. Also, there were 3 bottles of soap and shampoo and the fridge was almost empty. Clothes can be hung on the ladder with (or without) clothes hangers. No need to stash away all my clothes in the closet to fit yours in and make a mess out of it. Especially not when that closet is marked as private. My house was a big mess and you obviously violated my own privacy in my house. No way to treat a host.<br/>It was indeed an epic fail letting you into my house. It feels like a burglar went through it. Never feltt his bad when I came home. None of the Airbnb guest I had before experienced the problems that you mention. Maybe that is because they just don‚Äôt exist. I am sorry that you are dissatisfied, but I think the problem is not me. Especially since another (super)host wrote you a bad review about your behavior as well (and I saw you wrote a similar one to him nagging about a fan, towels and no soap. Is this your standard review when you were rude yourself?). I didn‚Äôt even ask if you needed the extra pillows you took from my closet to let another person stay in my house for free, which you obviously did before. I‚Äôd suggest you book a hotel next time to prevent bad experiences for Airbnb hosts (and for yourself).  Thanks! So happy you enjoyed staying at my place during your honeymoon :D That is great to hear, thank you so much :) And when you will be back, you're very welcome in my flat! Gracias! Merci! I feel very bad reading this. In 1,5 year Airbnb I never had complaints about the tidyness of my house. Yes, my old house gets dusty very quick but I extensively vaccuum cleaned - this sounds horrible. Also, there is nothing that I can do about mosquitos in my backyard. Another guest stayed in my house right after Fardus and she was very happy.  I offered you a full refund after the first night so this does not feel fair to me. I'm very sorry that you had this experience in my house. "
7621004,"I let the review period pass, sorry! Fatma and her boyfriend were perfect guests, left the house in perfect condition, thanks!  I let this review period pass as well, sorry! :)  Also Beatrice and her boyfriend were perfect guests. Took care of it like it was their own. Thanks! "
7679262,"Dankjewel Eve, fijn dat je het zo naar je zin had! Het was heel leuk je te ontmoeten. Dankjewel Sarah,  we zien je graag weer terug! I‚Äôm so sorry! I just had an operation on my ear, and I can‚Äôt measure loudness. Wish you would have let me know. Hello Rowan, <br/>strange to read your reaction. My place is on the edge of the center, close to the canals and with excellent public transport. My guests are always happy with the location, also because its very near to everything, but quiet.<br/>As to your cigarette smoke remark, my house is non-smoking, smoking if at all takes place outside. It‚Äôs funny to read Wanda‚Äôs review because we discussed before and gave her access to the garden. She even brought a friend and used the garden for many hours with the friend although the friend didn‚Äôt pay. Prices change according to high demand and location is very good. We supplied Wanda with food and drinks. She got a bit drunk and decided to be the type of guest who wants a 5 star hotel and ignores the fact that she is staying in a house. Unlike other guests she was quite disrespectful to us. Sorry to come into the room but had to for security reasons. And of course I knocked and was permitted access by guest Thank you! It was a pleasure to host you. I was very surprised with the review and don't know what was wrong. The room is just as described,  and my other guests like it and give good reviews. Maybe they had unrealistic expectations. I treated them kindly as I always do. thank you! I enjoyed hosting you Hi Haley, my listing doesn't include use of the kitchen and there is nothing in my advertisement to suggest that. My guests have half of the house for themselves including everything they need, just not the kitchen. Also in a hotel you don't get the use of the kitchen, sorry that this disappointed you. everybody has their own personal preferences and experiences. I'm just a little surprised, that Andy didn't look at my photos and my description of the guest room before he booked. One would expect that he would do so, as an experienced Airbnb user. I'm sorry that Veronique experienced some discomfort. But then Veronique was a guest who did not seem happy in general. Very rarely, some guests like to leave reviews that are unfair. In this case, Veronique left a few remarks that are either untrue or proof that she did not read my advertisement when she made the booking.  She mentioned a cat, my cat appears in text and photo in my advertisement, that she apparently did not read. It does not come in the guests room.As for the size of the room, is exactly the size mentioned in my advertisement; many times I have 3 guests there and they are perfectly happy. Veronique was alone...! Its a 12 square meter bedroom. About the cold: there was 1 unusual cold night and I could have helped her with extra heating, as I also told her.  But Veronique did not complain to me, she preferred to be unhappy and then blame me in the review. In my opinion it's unfair. Just talk to your host.... Hi Katharina, thank you for staying with me and thank you for the nice review. In addition to what you wrote about the double loft bed: yes, it is written in my listing, and you can also see it on the photos of my guest room. Hi Joe, thanks for the review! I finally found out just after you left, what was wrong with the WIFI (a loose wire) and of course fixed it. Working fine now. Sorry I couldn't figure it out during your stay! It was a pleasure hosting you. Thank you so much! It was such a pleasure to host you! Thank you so much, Marie! It was a pleasure to host you! Thank you so much! It was such a pleasure to host you Heidi! Thank you Brittni! It was such a pleasure to host you! thank you, I enjoyed hosting you! By many rules, Laura is simply referring to my house rules which are published in my listing. The girls did not feel like obeying my rules and then complained about them. I feel they should not be staying in residential Airbnb's like mine. They smoked dope in front of my door, making the neighbors complain; and used my bathroom /shower as a toilet . terrible guests. thank you! Jullie ook bedankt! Thank you so much, I really enjoyed hosting you! thank you dear Chlo√©! It was a real pleasure to host you. thank you dear Eva! Hulya and her friends broke some of my house rules, and when I pointed this out, they became angry. They were drinking in the street, annoying my neighbors; using the shower to get the bathroom furniture wet, I cleaned the bathroom , and not Hulya - she is not telling g the truth. They were angry about checkout time which is written in my rules as well.  Such angry guests, like spoiled children. I would not recommend them. this was Sabine's first experience with Airbnb. She probably has to get used to Airbnb style sharing. Also the host should be able to use the bathroom..Bathroom area can be locked off so this comment is incorrect. About bedroom: In the Airbnb community we usually trust each other.  Usually my checkin times are very flexible, but it's a private house, not a hotel with a reception. So, sometimes I also have to be in time for an appointment. I always inform my guests and we always find a solution, so this seems an unfair review. thanks Feral. There are 3 different trams and even a train around the corner that go directly to the city in 5-10 minutes. You don't have to use 2 different trams. This is explained in the booklet in the guest room and explained at check-in. The bathroom is shared, as is normal when staying with a local host. For privacy in the bathroom,  2 doors  can be closed and locked between guest and host quarters. Thanks again for staying with me. My house is a house, and not a hotel, that is the essence of Airbnb. Sometimes (unexperienced) Airbnb users have different expectations. The guest room, and the shared parts of the house, are non-smoking. A light smoke smell in shared areas (not in the guest room) is sometimes noticeable when doors are opened but guests can choose to leave them closed. The host of course never enters the guest room when there are guests.  Dear Xiaolu, my house is a house and not a luggage storage or a hotel :) since I had guests after you I could not leave all your suitcases in the room for you, and the normal option which all my guests use is luggage storage at the station. Apparently you had some more expectations, sorry to hear that. thank you Helene! you are always welcome. Dear Inha, thank you for your review, I think this is the translation: ""Easy-to-find location, and in a quiet neighborhood. Kind host, and clean house. Recommended nearby restaurants were great. Good memories.""<br/>You are always welcome! Hi Owen thank you for the review. I'm sorry to hear about your problem with smoke smell, wish you had told me during your stay. There is strict no-smoking in all the guest areas of the house, unfortunately I had some guests before you that I suspect of smoking in the room.  Thank you Stephen! I enjoyed hosting you! I was only brushing my teeth, in my own bathroom :)      Andreas must sleep very light! It was not a very good experience to host Millin and his friends. Even though I allowed for their flexible check-in (6 hours earlier!), they did not keep the appointed time, but showed up too early when I was not ready. They disappeared before the agreed check-out time, leaving the room and bathroom very dirty. They cooked in the room leaving it smelling very bad. In the review they complain about the use of bathroom and kitchen, but everything is clearly stated in my listing. Apparently they did not read this when they booked, and decided to complain in their review. Unfortunately once in a while one gets guests lacking all social skills. thank you Patrick it was a pleasure to host and meet you :) thanks so much Peter, it was a pleasure! I'm so sorry that- very seldom- people like Jonas rent the guest room in my house. His review is a lie. My guest room is advertised as a guest room, and not as a whole apartment like he claims. Jonas is also misleading other Airbnb users about the price that he paid, which was less then 300 euros, and not 500 euros like he writes. Jonas is giving Airbnb and experienced hosts a bad name. I regret having trusted him to be my guest. Thank you for staying with me Nasko! Glad you enjoyed it. I got the table repaired, thanks to your comment ! el ba√±o es compartido que es bastante normal en Airbnb y eso esta anunciado en el listing.  Hello Agnes, I'm sorry that you found the room small. It is exactly as shown on the pictures, not too big but it has sleeping place for 3. Some people want to share it with 3 to profit from a cheaper price, this is their, and your, own choice. As for kitchen use, this is clearly stated in the listing too. The room has amenities such as fridge, microwave, water boiler. I'm glad you liked the rest! Sorry I did not have a chance to meet you in person. kind regards Dear Angelique, what a pity that you did not contact me ! I could have arranged things for you. I always give my guests access to the garden while I'm there. Sorry to hear that it did not work out that way ‚Ä¶really. best regards, Marijke Hello Charlotte, thank you for your review. My check-out time, which is 11 AM, is clearly stated on my listing. I could not accommodate you with your luggage after that because I had new guests coming. I made this very clear. I'm sorry that you feel the need to complain about it once more in your review. Of course you could have just booked that day too, in which case you could have left your luggage. Hello Nurul, I have 3 guests stay very often in the room and can't remember guests  mentioning the size of the room. I doubt if you would find a larger accommodation for 3 persons for that price- in a nice house and location- in Amsterdam. thank you Yiuzhou it was a pleasure to host you Ciao Silvia. Mi dispiace che la camera non ha soddisfatto le vostre aspettative. Confermo la regola di non fumare. Purtroppo, a quanto pare, una precedente ospite non ha rispettato la regola e mi scuso ancora sentito l'odore. Ho fatto del mio meglio per voi chiedendo se si ha un problema al momento del check-in; allora si potrebbe ancora avere cancellato o quotazione cambiato. Subito dopo la visita ho pulito a fondo e installato un filtro aria professionale quindi tutto √® pulito e fresco di nuovo.<br/><br/>Saluti, tx Santiago, you are always welcome! Thank you dear Ryan!  thank you too! Thank you Sean, you'r always welcome! Merci Jonathan! Nati thank you! I really loved having you and your friends as my guests and hope to see you again! thank you Christina! I'm happy you enjoyed it, it was my pleasure Thank you Ulf it was nice to host you. I'm planning to do something with the closet behind the bed any day now, so there will be extra shelf space within a week!  tx for the tip though! Hello Frederic it was really bad luck because my washing machine broke down in the day you were there and I had it replaced. There was no other option (because of new guests coming next day) then to do washing at night because I was out like you know‚Ä¶I did not dare to disturb you to talk about it and just hoped it was not too noisy. I'm very sorry that you had to go through this. It was indeed a one time thing. I contacted you later to offer you a refund in case of disturbance,which I am so sorry that you had; but you did not reply. However, if you are ever in Amsterdam again, you have a free night in my house‚Ä¶and in complete silence. As you can see in other reviews, there were no complaints about noise before. Sorry for the bad luck! Thank you! it was really nice to have you as guests and to talk a little about this and that‚Ä¶and thank you for the birthday card !! thank you Josephine, it was very nice to host you and your friends, all the best! gracias Ana, que buena idea, voy a comprar un microondas! dear Gretchen, thank you for your review. I am sorry to hear that you noticed a smell of smoke. Smoking is forbidden in the guest room and in the parts of the house that the guests are using. I state this very clearly in my house rules which I send to all my guests. No other non-smoking guests did notice this before, however I will take your remark in consideration of course and make it even more clear, thank you! Mi dispiace leggere una recensione cos√≠ da parte vostra...sul prezzo purtroppo non posso affittarla a meno; per quanto riguarda l'ospitalit√° invece mi pare abbiate avuto tutta la mia disponibilit√°...vi ho aperto alle tre del mattino perch√© avevate perso le chiavi, preparato il caff√© e dato informazioni di base su come spostarvi.. di pi√∫ non potevo fare!"

Thank you for your feedback. Good to hear you had a nice stay in our apartment! I‚Äôm sorry you decided to leave our apartment. Almost all the old houses in Amsterdam have steep stairs‚Ä¶This is clearled stated in our house description and was also mentioned by other guests in their reviews.

7803724,"merci Brice! thanks for staying with me and positive review Merci Leo!  Hi Ameline, my shower is not enterly molded..I cleaned it fully upon your arrival with Bleach.  You can dry the shower area with the wringe mop provided to you, which is clean as wel.  Before your arrival I cleaned really the whole apartment.  To bad you are not satisfied, the 2 matrasses are brand new.    Ok, next time I will buy some flowers.    very demanding tenant..and uptight.."

I am really glad you found the apartment so comfortable.  I hope there is another opportunity for you to stay the next time you visit Amsterdam.   Hi Cemre, or the ""Colgne People"" as you signed in my guest book - just got back from a few days away myself.  Iit's so great that you booked such a long time ago and now we have finally met.  You and your friends are such a nice group.  You picked the perfect weekend although I know the public transport issues did not help.  Thanks so much for your feedback - very much appreciated.

7968650,"Unfortunately, my experience with this guest was very disappointing. Despite agreeing to pay for additional rent for extra stay, they chose to take advantage of my trust and did not fulfill their commitment. I would caution future hosts to be very careful, as this behavior shows a clear lack of honesty and respect for agreements. I do not recommend hosting this guest It was a pleasure having you and your friends at our place - Thank you for taking care of the plants ;) you are welcome! Hope you had a nice stay Thank you Ilana for talking care of the apartment, it was a pleasure having you and hope to mee you in person soon.

7999104,"Thank you for being great guests. The festive season in the neighbourhood might be a bit livelier than other times as previous guests have never reported any problems with noise - hence the superhost status for my apartment. Thank you for the review Jade. My apartment block is residential and I guess my neighbours were having a Xmas party! That certainly doesn't happen very often.  Thanks for being great guests. Traditional Dutch staircases are quite steep - all part of an authentic experience!  Sorry you went to the wrong door, these things happen! Thanks Guenter. Thank you Henry, you were very understanding and are welcome back anytime.  Welcome back anytime Katrine, thank you so much. You were great guests Chloe - many thanks and come back soon :)"

Thank you for your feedback Sasha!<br/>I can take care of bigger pillows and in time make the stairs to the ceiling more robuust.<br/>The stairs to the appartment are like in many houses in Amsterdam.<br/>Also the noice is part of the centre of the town. I myself use earplugs when it is noicy and that works.<br/>The noice is mostly in the weekend and not the whole night. Thank you Steven!<br/>It was a pleasure to host you and your wife. Thank you Andy for your review and it was a pleasure to meet you! Thank you Maimuna for your review and it was a pleasure hosting you! Thank you for taking care of my home!

8405599,"Dear Richie, you were lovely guests , you treated my houseboat as it should be. I am glad you had a wonderful time on my ship. Hope to see you again. Regards Hans   It was nice to see you again on my houseboat. You are a very welcome guest. Iam looking foreward to see you again on short notice.  I feel sad that the boat wasn't as these guests expected, but I definitely explained the guests that it is a still working ship, so it's different than an apartment. I'm sorry that you guys didn't had the best experience, but I offered all the help if needed, but didn't hear anything during there stay, so assumed everything was fine. It's easy to complain afterwards but not really nice since I was willing to solve problems and answer all the questions if needed."
8447951,Hey Vanina! I just found this message. What a nice review! Thank you so much. How‚Äôs Amsterdam treating you? It must have been a winter wonderland at the canals yesterday. Hope you saw a glimpse of it!
8462169,"Interesting review Peter...considering everything you mentioned as 'missing' is exactly as described in my listing and photos, including the vintage style of the apartment. Deducting a star for not reading the listing carefully, not booking a hyper-modern accommodation & not checking the cupboards properly (where an espresso maker and a variety of mugs and wine/champagne/long-drink glasses could be found), is a bit silly, don't you agree? Dear Amanda, just send me a text next time and i'll tell you there's a whole stack of everything you 'missed' below the kitchen sink where you forgot to look ;) 45 minutes, by foot maybe :) The tram will take you to Museumsquare in 5 min!"
8494940,"Your detailed review of your experience is greatly appreciated. Thank you Zhenyun! I am glad you and your family enjoyed your stay - even with the extra stairs :) This is a very beautiful compliment, thank you Nick! Your Brooklyn apartment on Airbnb is a testament to your design tastes and hosting methods for sure :) Your complete and thoughtful review is much appreciated :) Many times as hosts we try to create an easy and enjoyable experience. Your added mentions around the check-in video or even the balcony, as an example, help me to understand what guests like about the apartment and their stay.  Location and apartment level are great items to highlight. My neighborhood Oud-West is a perfect place for travelers looking for a local experience while accessing the center by frequent trams, 20/30 minute walk or Amsterdam-friendly bike ride. Being on the third floor makes the apartment bright, quiet and peaceful. I'll make sure both of these are clearer for future guests. Thanks Mohamed for sharing!"

We were in good contact before and during their stay and they treated everything here with respect. The apartment was left clean and organized (even got a lovely present) and I can definitely recommend them as the perfect guests in any place! All the best to you and many more nice travels to come!"
8657706,"hi Ilenia, as explained, the wifi modem/router was broken just before you arrived, the cable company could have had a repair-man replacing the modem the day after your arrival, but you preferred to stay undisturbed and use the mobile 4G hotspot I provided instead. <br/>I understand how important wifi is and tried everything to accommodate the situation. <br/>For you and future guests, know that there is 2,4 and 5g connection of almost 250Mbps (more then plenty for streaming Netflix, 4k video, etc). <br/><br/>But I'm also glad to read that you did appreciate the place as your messaged me: ""‚ÄúThanks for the wonderful stay, Elwin. We loved staying at your houseboat, it was comfortable, beautiful to wake up to, and the location was perfect!‚Äù"
8664912,"Thenna and her boyfriend were very pleasant and friendly guests who we would like to welcome again, might they come back to Amsterdam again."
8691762,"I was a bid sick yes. This happens. So sorry. Bad response of u. I paid 100 euros to u what airbnb told me i did not had too. Airbnb paid the rest. Luckily i only have 5 stars. Next time book private airbnb. Great stay of u! Thanks for the good days. The guest started making food at 23.00 in the evening. Thats a bit late is it not in a shared space and respect others:) The washing machine is indeed downstairs. Thats were all the neighbours do there laundry:) When the guests arrived I took all the bags up and when they left, at 06:00 in the morning I took them down. Yes, at that time you dont want to make much noise is it for other people in the building. Here we respect others.  So the review is fairly unfair. The problem is that they thought on arrival that the whole apartment was for themselves. They did misread. But the communication is clear, you rent the room. A whole apartment in the centre of the city will cost you double the price. So please disregard the review and look at all the others. First time in years people say something about the price. The location is centre city. They price is very clear on the website. But I am happy they had a very good stay with nice weather. In the night its 15 degrees in the room and with a winter blanket you don't need a heather. That would be strange. I never have complaints from any guest, see all the positive reviews.  The fact Alex did not sleep was probably because he left 5.30 in the morning to catch his flight to Russia. BTW, you don't get a cold from a cold room, but from a virus:) It was great to see Jackie loving Amsterdam so much. She was a lovely guest.  "

Dear Monja, Sorry to hear that you didn't know about Kingsday, I thought that was the reason you also came to Amsterdam!<br/>About the shower, it recently break and we couldn't repair it because we are on holiday at the moment, I am apologize for that. The manuals are in the closet of the kitchen but my mom didn't know that.. <br/>If we check inn ourselves we tell that. But now  we know that we need to make it more clear for our clients!<br/><br/>Thank you so much for this feedback and we hope you had a pleasant stay!<br/>Warm regards Nancy Dear Oliver, thank you for everything. The tv is working but it was not connected to the media box. Little bit stupid that we didn't tell you that you need to turn on the one in the bedroom before it works it the living. We don't use it so much so we forgot to mention it. <br/>The turtle is still fine and happy! If we ever need a turtle sitter we call you!<br/> I hope you have a great time working at ING, maybe we meet again in the future! Thank you for staying in our house!

About your comment that the cats are not mentioned, please (everybody who reads this review) note that there is a standard format for presenting facilities etc on the system platform [mostly in the form of ticking/checking items on a list if they are present/applicable], and this includes ""pets live on the property"", which we ticked, and added a comment about the cats! This is the first time that we have felt the need to comment on a guest review, but we feel compelled to do so because the comments and the ratings are so unjustified. They are completely out of line with both reality and the opinion of the vast majority of our guests. We normally get big compliments, to highlight just a few examples, about the comfort of the bed, the breakfast, the amenities and the location, each of which Andrea was very negative about. Rather than reflecting reality, her comments reflect what an unpleasant person with a bitter attitude she is [unlike her friend Lee (Hong Ha), who was lovely]. One thing that Andrea does not mention is that when Gabriella wanted to introduce herself and say hello, Andrea turned away and didn‚Äôt want to shake her hand. Perhaps Andrea would enjoy life more if she learned basic human courtesy and didn‚Äôt look for the negative in everything (she seems to enjoy looking for it)‚Ä¶and find it even if it is not there. Thanks for being such lovely guests Maria and Ira, so sorry we somehow missed writing you a review - if we had, it would have been a very positive one with a very strong recommendation!

9085127,"Thank you for your friendly words Michele! I hope to welcome you again! De accomodatie is geadverteerd als kamer met douche. Niet als appartement. Vandaar dat er behalve koffie en thee met bijbehorende kopjes en glazen geen verdere keukenspullen zijn. Het is beslist geen zelfstandige woonruimte met alles erop en eraan. Maar als jullie mij gevraagd hadden, had ik best wel wat bestek en servies willen brengen. Danke f√ºr die netten Worte Annette. Sch√∂n, dass es Euch gefallen hat! What a pity you did not contact me during your stay about your complaints. I am sure I could have solved them. I never get comments about the heater or cleanliness. The stains on the wall are from a roof leak and will soon be painted. Hope you take home nice memories of Amsterdam inspite! Hahaha, I know the stairs are steep, but there are not 7 but ' only' 4. Thank you for your nice words. You make me blush! Thank you for your friendly words! Thank you for your friendly words Alex! You are welcome again any time! Due to construction works in the building there were some problems with water supply. That was a temporary,  exceptional situation. Thank you for your friendly words. It was a great pleasure to see you enjoying your stay! Thank you for your friendly words. You are always welcome to come back! Thank you for your friendly words Felix! Come back when the sun is shining! Haha, das mit dem knackigen Hintern kommt vom Treppensteigen? War also auch ein Fitnessurlaub (-: I can imagine the two separate beds are a disadvantage for couples, but other guests, who are no couples, just appreciate that.<br/>Anyway, thanks for your friendly words and come back when you are in Amsterdam.. What a pity you did not enjoy the room. The stairs couldn't have surprised you, I clearly mention them in my listing and of course I would have understood if you hadn't  chosen my room because of the stairs. <br/>About the heat: Yes it was unusual hot in Amsterdam. Therefore I put a fan in the room. This is the Netherlands, temperatures around 30 degrees are very exceptional. You won't find air conditioning in many AirBnB rooms in Amsterdam. I hope you will be more lucky next time! Thanks a lot Marisha, for your nice words! Thank you for your friendly words Maddie!<br/>Come back when the sun is shining! Thanks a lot Amy for the great review and your personal feedback!<br/>And... come again!<br/> Gracias Fabiana. Muy amable! Besos y hasta pronto.. Ha thank you Rebecca!<br/>The warm weather rather surprised me! Sorry for not being so attentive to fish up the fan out of its winter storage. Next time I won't forget (-: Muchas gracias Gabriel! Muy amable! Hi Yong, it is a pity you didn't ask for it, the hairdryer was in the little cabinet under the sink. I know the stairs can be a reason for some people not to choose this room. That's why I mention it in the listing. Also that the room is private and the breakfast additional. Thank you very much for your kind words and wish you a fantastic rest of your trip through Europe!"
9133729,"Val√©rie was the first one ever who did not follow my, very exact, directions to get to the boat: she got off the subway a station to far. <br/>That's why she was to late to rent a bike, she sent me a dozen messages within the hour, that I responded to immediately, trying to help her find a bike Saturday at 5 pm. Did not succeed and she blames me in her review! Not nice, never welcome anymore. Henk"
9135742,"Bedankt Amanda <br/>Wat betreft de kat wist je van te voren dat zij in het verblijf is. Het staat in mijn advertentie ook lees je het in de reviews. <br/>Je zegt dat je voor de kat moet zorgen? Overal had ik zelf al bakjes met water en brokjes neergezet. Keuken, balkon en woonkamer.. Indien je langer dan drie dagen verblijft vraag ik iemand alleen om haar bakje met brokjes bij te vullen. <br/>Ik vind het erg overdreven dat je het als taking care of ziet. <br/>Daarnaast ben je ook niet eerlijk geweest over de handdoeken. Ik heb je beloofd dat ik dit niet openbaar zal maken omdat ik het heb kunnen oplossen met het resolutie centrum Hi Solange<br/>I'm very shocked by your review. I answered you on 27 January (see email) to your question that I rent the entire house and not a room! This is also described in detail in the listing. It also says that I have a cat. Did you not read that? The photos also show exactly what the house is like. You see the clothes racks, the bed, the cat, my living room with paintings. The airbnb help center has confirmed that. Because as a host I have provided the information correctly. That is why you have not received a refund. Because the strict cancellation policy was in force. You decided to leave yourself. Together with you I tried to call airbnb but you wanted to go to a hotel. I advise you to gather your information well next time before you book.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Hi solange! <br/>No you have the whole house <br/>Didnt i wrote it in the discription? <br/>Of you want to book it be Quick <br/>Jan 27, 2020<br/>Solange stuurde een verzoek Jan 27, 2020<br/>Bericht van Solange<br/>Hi Moira!

9287447,"Thank you for the nice review. Sorry the stairs were not convenient for your husband. For Amsterdam you will find that in most places though, often more steep or less wide. Hope to meet again, cheers! Thank you for the nice review! About the time to to city center, the tram to Leidseplein takes 15  minutes. A bus to Jordaan area 10 minutes. So it depends what you view as city center. Rembrandtplein and Dam square are a bit further. Hope to welcome you again sometime. Okay!  :) Hi Wahid,<br/><br/>Sorry to hear. I do describe both your comments in the advert. The distance to the center is ten minutes on the bike or tram, to Leidseplein. Amsterdam has different city centers of course, Leidseplein/Jordaan is closest to my area. Other parts take 20-25 minutes.<br/><br/>The furniture is exactly as on the pictures. The kitchen improved with a new wooden working space.<br/><br/>You can always reach me for comments during your stay, when I showed you around all seemed fine.<br/><br/>Hope to welcome you again,<br/><br/>Gert<br/><br/> I'm happy you had a good time. Hope to see you again!<br/><br/>Gert"

9322038,"An explanation is required: An old building next to our house is being renovated (almost done). The mice were probably living there and went looking for a new place... We have never had them before or since, so unfortunately for our guests they were present during their stay. They were defenitely not rats. I feel really bad about the whole thing, however, it was a one time only disturbance. Sandeep and I communicated about this and all is cleared up. "

We vonden het ook erg leuk met jullie. Hi Rob,<br/>That‚Äôs a mistake, no idea why I put that. Perhaps I was already thinking about how it wasn‚Äôt touristy. Apologies for this, I‚Äôve tried to edit my comment but Airbnb will not let me as you have also left a review. I left an additional comment on your review as that was all I could do. Not sure if there is much more I can do?

9406727,"Dear Will, Very nice having you here again. You and your friends are very nice and easy going, neat guests. See you! Sas Hi!. We have recently upgraded the appartement -  before the second bedroom was connected with a door to the living room which did not give enough privacy in bedroom 2.  We recently have placed a wall between the 2 rooms and closed the door to make a more quite bedroom 2. Before our guests told us that is what they like better!  I hope you enjoyed your stay and the space! Saskiae"
9412285,"Hola Jacoba, gracias por tu comentario, aunque no entiendo que si tus palabras son  positivas porque valoras la veracidad con un numero 4 sin explicar el motivo de tu puntuaci√≥n. <br/>Un saludo muy cordial <br/>Ana He estado esperando el informe policial que enviar a Airbnb. En esos momentos yo no estaba en casa, mis hijos s√≠. Una mentira tras otra. Terri viajaba con su marido. Pens√© que solo usar√≠an una cama, ese fue mi error desde ahora preguntar√© siempre. Cuando Terri vio que una de las camas no estaba hecha se enfad√≥ yo le dije que era mi error y que pod√≠a solucionarlo en 5 minutos.  No escuch√≥ y empez√≥ a insultarme, amedrentarme y amenazarme con demandarme por fraude. Insist√≠ 5 veces en que todo se arreglaba en 5 minutos. Sigui√≥ igual. Mi hijo me llamo los hu√©spedes gritaban mucho se escuchaban portazos, golpes y varios vecinos se hab√≠an quejado. Le dije a mi hijo que llamara a la polic√≠a, un agente se ofreci√≥ estar presente si mi familia bajaba a hacer la cama ella se neg√≥. El 13 de mayo le expliqu√© porque hab√≠amos llamado a la polic√≠a. Terri dijo:‚ÄúKarma te brindara a tu familia y a tu salud la justicia que mereces! !!!El karma viene hacia ti!!!<br/>la empresa de limpieza encontr√≥ 4 botellas de vino vac√≠as.<br/>Solo buscas venganza, Airbnb no te echa si tu tienes raz√≥n. Gracias Oscar! Espero que teng√°is una vida de lo m√°s feliz posible y suerte que eso siempre ayuda! Hola Laure,<br/>No se a que olor te refieres. Nosotros ventilamos muy bien el apartamento cada vez que tenemos que limpiarlo para la visita de un nuevo hu√©sped. Nadie se ha quejado sobre este tema, tu eres la primera y espero que la ultima, estar√© atenta a esto. Tambi√©n pod√≠ais abrir ventanas y puertas mientras vosotras estabais dentro, o haberme dicho algo sobre esto durante tu estancia, entonces yo podr√≠a haber hecho algo al respecto, ahora ya no, me suena un pico a chino, no de a que te refieres, a que clase de olor te refieres. Hay personas que tienen un olfato muy muy desarrollado, a mi me pasa con la audici√≥n. <br/>Un saludo muy cordial y como ta te dije antes, mucha y buena salud para ti y para todos tus seres queridos.<br/>Erris y Ana Gracias Morana por tus palabras! Siento mucho lo de la tv, justo cuando yo estaba de vacaciones! En verdad con los port√°tiles y ordenadores nadie usa la tv o nunca nos dijeron que la tv no funcionaba bien.  Os deseamos una feliz vida y mucha y buena salud! Gracias Zet por tus palabras! Siento no haber estado aqu√≠ para saludaros! Feliz vida y mucha y buena salud! When Angus was here I was in spain wiht holidays.  We hired a company called Home2host to take care of everything, it was a drama, all dirty, all the bad olia fabric, bleach stains and a painting and a 1930's art deco lamp (irreplaceable) broken, of the host arrived more than 30 minutes late.  I was not able to enjoy my holidays, in each new reservation they called me by phone. Terrible! From here I apologize to my guests. Sorry.<br/>Ana Lora Hello Katerina, sorry for my late reaction. I was very busy with my study. I just onlu to say thanks for your words. for me it was a pleasure and an honor to have you here, to you and to your friends. everything was great, communication and the apartment was super clean, thank you for it! I hope everything will go well in life and you enjoy being together with your beautiful son !!<br/>health and good luck to all!<br/>Saluos<br/>Ana Hallo Helmut,<br/>First of all I want to apologize to you for my late response to your comment. We are very busy here with the works of  our apartment, now there are 2 bedrooms and 2 bedrooms, it will be finish in december. That is de reason I forgot to respond to your review. Sorry for that.<br/>I also want to thank you for your words. For me it was a pleasure and an honor to have you here as guests, you are a gentleman, and your grandson too.<br/>Un saludo and I hope everything goes well. Especially in health it is most important.<br/>Greetings from Amsterdam<br/>Ana We do not understand and do not agree with your words. Many things in life is a matter of taste, there who likes to smell good sheets with softeners and there who would not like. Nobody in four years has complained of the smell of furniture, they are ancient but not old. The garden, you're right does not look good with plastics, there are provisional, to divide and give more privacy between the garden of my neighbour and mine, before there were plants, but next month begin the work with a new bedroom and bathroom and we had to remove them so they could to the foundation. We have very good coffee machine, Italian, it makes great coffee. About the microwave, have already broken two, the last time a guest put something metallic and almost came out on fire, I don't want to take this risk again. The location of our small apartment is perfect for many, not for everyone of course,  especially for people traveling by car, parking is for free here, and that is already a pretty big advantage in Amsterdam. Or for people traveling with children, or for people who after a day of hustle in Amsterdam centrum want to rest and relax in a quiet place near a park. Also we are near to the center, well connected to public services. <br/>We think you left the place like a camping. It was very untidy and dirty.<br/>Saludos<br/>Ana Hello Sandrina,<br/>Sorry that your stay was not as you had desired, shame. It really sorry for you, your friend and for your son Hugo. Only one thing, garden furniture are not old nor to throw, some furniture are hard and resistant wood and are painted and varnished. So far no one has complained about the light coming through the window. Anyway, within a month, as already told you we will expand the study and there will be more space, and as I explain you  the wardrobe put in the bedroom is only  provisional and temporarily.<br/>In the future there will be two bedrooms each with a bathroom. Well Sandrine tell you again that I'm sorry, I do the best I can to try to make the guests have a pleasant stay.<br/>I wish you good luck and good health in life.<br/>Saludos<br/>Ana"

We feel very sorry Yvonne that you have this idea about Airbnb. We have no access to the credit card from your parents and we didin't charge any extra costs outside the booking. If you book on Airbnb you see all the costs. This is what it is! We get only our fee from Airbnb after you parents left. Also we picked them up from the airport for an very honest price and I bring them to the city center as service. We really liked your parents and we feel bad if they have the idea that we charge to much. Sorry for this but it should be clear and plain on the Airbnb site! if you look for Hotels in the neighborhood then we are a lot cheaper and better in our opinion. All the best for the hole family and anyway thank your parents again for a lovely stay!

Jullie ook bedankt! altijd welkom wanneer je weer een weekendje Amsterdam nodig hebt! Veel liefs Marloes & Gabriel Liebe Conny, als G√§ste l√§nger bei uns bleiben dan versuchen wir immer, einmal die Zimmer zu reinigen. Staubsaugen; Abfall weg bringen; Handt√ºcher Wechseln, und Vielleicht Auff√ºllen von Kaffee und Tee. Es tut uns sehr leid, dass Sie das als intimiderend erlebt haben. Bis jetzt had jeder das sehr gut gefallen. In einem Hotel wird jeden Tag gereinigt. Wir versuchen unser BB auf einem luxus und saubere niveau zu erhalten. Hallo Francisco, bedankt dat je de tijd hebt genomen om ons een review te schrijven ! Als het voor jullie zo belangrijk was de eenpersoons bedden waarom hebben jullie dat dan pas op de dag van aankomst laten weten?? Wij hadden net de nieuwe bedden geplaatst maar wisten niets over jullie verzoek. Jammer van de miscommunicatie."

All the best, Nanning Thanks a lot for the feedback Cynthia, very much appreciated.  With regards to the heater, everyone should be able to set the temparature at any comfortable level. But when I helpt you in the apartment the temperature was set @ 27 degrees and I gave an indication of a ""more normal level"" of temperature to be set (e.g. 21 / 22 degrees). (also had to do with the conversion of fahrenheit to degrees) ;)  Other that that, glad you enjoyed the overall stay! Hi Reshad, Thank you for the time you took to write me a review. First of all I'm very happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay so much! In regards to the lock, I've taken a look at this and have improved it to avoid this in the future. Apart from that I regret to hear that the cleaner had not finished the apartment. She had not let me know that she would be delayed. If I'd known I would of course have informed you about this. Once again my sincere apologies for this! The check in location is actually on your way tot the apartment from the airport. As I've noticed that it gives my guests a lot of flexibillity I've organized for it to be ready very close to central station. In this way you can decide yourself when you want to check in. As for the cutlery, perhaps you missed the drawer? I did provide it in the apartment!  Great to hear you had such a nice time in the apartment. I'm very sorry to hear about your opinion of the bathroom. In Amsterdam it's very common to have a bathroom that's not very big. For Amsterdam this one is not even that small actually. ;) Besides the size we made it a nice and modern place with everything you need. Thank you for staying, hope to host you again someday. Cheers. <br/> Carla was a great guest. We were happy to welcome her in the apartment. Unfortunately the heater in one of the rooms didn't get to the right temperature (it was the first cold night in 2015 where a heater was needed), and it was difficult to have it fixed straight away. We hope that she will come back in the future and have the same heater experience as the other guests!"

I regret that but if its important for you have to read our facilities and they said: no microwave. The place is about 48 m2 including your bathroom. Thats what you also can check before you booked and that's quit a lot in Amsterdam thanks for the warm words and rating Dan !"
9943984,"Gabriel I am deeply sorry that your last night was ruined. We left 10 days before you arrived and I can guarantee you there was no mouse in the house when we left or else I would have called an exterminator. You can see from my reviews we have never had a negative incident in any of our properties and never any previous mice issues.  I do my utmost to provide my guests the best experience possible.  There are some circumstances that are out of my control-given the age of the house (118 years old)  and the crowded city there are times when mice come  in when the weather is very rainy or extremely cold but that is rare since we keep a very clean house, there is nothing to attract them to the house.  There is no way to prevent or anticipate these rare moments, we can only rectify it when it happens.  Again I apologize that it happened and that it ruined your stay. Thanks Ann for renting with us- glad you enjoyed your time here! Thanks for renting with us- hope to welcome you back again in the future! Thanks Krishna for renting with us- so glad you enjoyed your stay! Thanks Ted for renting with us! Thanks Giovanni- so glad you enjoyed the apartment and the neighborhood!

9948828,"I honestly never experienced myself before to smell petrol from downstairs garage in my entire apartment. It turned out to be a bad leakage and we fixed it with the neighbours. Still, as the host I felt very sorry about the incident for which I couldn't do anything during the guests' stay. It was a rather upsetting experience 'cause I always wholeheartedly try to facilate my guests. Thanks Jessalyn. It was a pleasure to host. Indeed as you guessed in the private message, it was rainy much last week when the laundry was done. I'm sorry that the linens doesn't smell totally fresh, but they were of course all clean.  Thanks Nathan for the feedback. Indeed the sun rises early now in summer time. Actually a sun blind is on the way to be soon installed. The apartment is spacious and cozy enough to host three people though. "

10079417,"Well‚Ä¶ what to say about this. Communication with Hannah started fine. Then there was the incident with the broken closet door. What happened to the closet is unclear. It was perfectly fine when the guest entered and broken (completely separated from the closet) after. According to Hannah it happened ‚Äòspontaneously‚Äô. Attempts to briefly talk about it were answered with hesitation and when we did spoke about it, they were nervous and vague about it. Suddenly in a hurry for a train that would leave 1,5hours later. I announced that I would contact AIRBNB for insurance purposes and started the process through AIRBNB AirCover. The rest is a process of AIRBNB, who of course will contact the guest first to see how it happend and if they would accept liability. When denied, AIRBNB has fortunately solved the situation directly with us. I will not react to the petty comments about me or the room and will let the other reviews speak for themselves."

Many thanks and all the best, Ralf Thanks Eirik, it was a big pleasure to see and host you. See you next time! Many thanks and all the best, Ralf Thank you for the feedback. Unfortunately, the check-in part was written out of frustration from your side.¬†<br/>First of all was the communication of you extremely bad. We don't get responses on several messages. For our idea, very strange.<br/>We are extremely flexible with check-in times, but a very, very (!) early check-in is unfortunately not for free. And I give you also an extra discount because you forget this and arrived with a baby. We have charged a small extra fee for organizing the very early check-in and we are specially coming back, last minute, from work to the accommodation to help you out.¬†<br/>This special request for an very early check-in came very last minute! The prices for an early check-in you can find very easy on my profile. I don't understand that we are not flexible then. <br/>Our standard check-in is between 5:00 PM and 7:00 PM. So if you want to check in very early because you arrive in Amsterdam very early at the check-in day, there are a lot of options. Also when you want to check-in very late. <br/>We are happy to help you. But please, communicate, we have also a planning. <br/>Best Ralf It was a pleasure to host you Matt. Very cool that you booked again. We will see you soon! Anne, many thanks for your stay and for your 5 star review. It was a big pleasure to host you and your friends. It is very cool that you come back, I will see you quickly. Hi Rae, it was so lovely to host you! Many thanks for your stay and for your 5 star review. Big hug, Ralf Thanks Maya to receive your review. We dont understand that you wrote that you must bring your own towels. You stayed with 2 persons and you received 4 towels for the whole stay, included a washing mashine, a dryer and laundry detergent. The communication with you was very bad. Also we dont understand the lock 'problem', because you received your own key, own lock and you stayed at your own private space in the house. It was for us not a pleasure to host you. We try to communicate very good with you, we gave you tips and we wanted that you did felt at home, but you dont communicate back. Susan, thanks to get a good and 5 star review. It was a pleasure to meet you, and yes till a next time. Thanks Karl to receive a good and 5 star review. It was a pleasure to meet you. Till the next time! Thanks, it was a pleasure to host you! Hopefully we will see you again. Thanks Wendy, it was a pleasure to host you. Thanks for the good time. Translation of the review: Excellent location in the center, the destination was walking distance almost everywhere. The shopping street is just next the door and the Dam Square is a short walk away. An effective solution for four. Washer and dryer were good. Also a reasonably well-equipped kitchen and a large dining table worked very well and within walking distance there was a large and good grocery store. Close to the train station, so easy to travel around. Thanks for your good review Marco. I hope to see you again! This is your review in English: Fantastic and authentic. Perfect location for city tours, shopping and public transportation. The apartment is complete as described in the advertisement. Very beautiful and cozy decoration. Ralf received us very well, showed the whole place, explained some details and gave us good information about Amsterdam. As he said, you have to keep an eye on the stairs. We hope to return! Sorry to read your comment Barbera. Unfortunately, I also gave you a bad review. I think it's unthinkable to be able to host you. For all clarity. You have stayed an extra day in my house for free. This because you wanted to check in early and check out later than usual. I have provided you with many tips about Amsterdam. Your negative review is based on the fact that things are being asked that are not normal. Total disrespectful. For example, it's common for you to buy your own food and facilitate living facilities, outside of the available items. My profile does not mean that I also facilitate your total food and drink or extra expensive (smell) hand soap. Beside this, my house have al the facilities and I arrange on arrival toilet paper and extra things like hand soap (but not the one from Rituals).  Thank you to Jasmina. I am happy that you are safe at home. I hope to see you again! X Thanks Anna, i hope to see you again! X Thanks Marika, Your review in English en Dutch: <br/><br/>Excellent stay in this beautiful and typical apartment with a terrace overlooking the rooftops of Amsterdam. Located in the center, this apartment offers the opportunity to easily visit the city and the canals on foot. Certainly steep stairs and the door handles do not take very well, but the place is really nice and stamped the features that make the city what it is. We hope to repeat the experience soon. Ralf thank you !!<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Uitstekend verblijf in dit prachtige en karakteristieke appartement met een terras met uitzicht op de daken van Amsterdam. Dit appartement ligt in het centrum, biedt de mogelijkheid om gemakkelijk een bezoek aan de stad en de grachten te voet. Zeker steile trappen en de deurgrepen niet erg goed, maar de plaats is echt mooi en de functies die de stad tot wat het is gestempeld. We hopen de ervaring snel te herhalen. Ralf thank you !! Thanks Omar, The review in English: Ralf thank you again for your welcome and your punctuality what else to say second rental and always on top more I comes to you and I love Amsterdam soon On arrival there is always toilet paper. Also for mark there was extra toilet paper in the closet room in the bathroom. Mark has not ask where he can find extra toilet paper during his stay. In the fridge is my own food for longer durability.   Hi Antonieta, I am so sorry for the bottles, i saw that also after your check-out. I did not checked the roof terrace because the bad weather before your check-in. Sorry sorry, but i hope that i see you again! Best Ralf Charles is a nice boy and found his stay excellent until the time that Charles lost the security keys and all the safety locks should be replaced. It's a shame that Charles does not understand that this is very expensive and therefore writes a bad review. Charles is not responsible guest. In addition, Charles also came hours later than the arranged check-in time. Here Charles did not pay for it and not appreciated by Charles. Thanks, it was a big pleasure to meet you ! Thanks Lisanne, it was a big pleasure to host you! Thanks Naomi, it was a big, big pleasure!  See you again! Thanks Kelly for your stay, it was a big pleasure to meet you. See you! Thanks for your lovely review, it was a big, big pleasure to meet you. See you! Thanks Chris, it was a big, big pleasure to meet you! You're welcome, it was a great pleasure to meet you. See you! Thanks, always welcome back! See you! Thanks Sai, it was a big pleasure to meet you. I hope to see you again, warm greetings Ralf It was a big pleasure to meet you, hope to see you again. Warm greetings Hi Wouter, thanks voor je review. <br/><br/>Het was leuk om je te mogen hosten en het is zeker tof dat je weer terug komt. Goed dat je publiekelijk aangeeft wat we besproken hebben en hierbij dan ook mijn publiekelijk reactie. <br/><br/>Het dakterras als extra service staat niet in de kleine letters, maar duidelijk vermeld op de Airbnb listing. Wij hebben geen andere plek binnen Airbnb om dit te vermelden. Je gaf aan niet erg goed bekend te zijn met Airbnb en de listing niet te hebben gelezen. Dat is natuurlijk wat anders dan dat deze informatie in de kleine lettertjes staat. Om je tegemoet te komen heb je dan ook een flinke korting ontvangen voor het gebruik van het dakterras waar je erg blij mee was. <br/><br/>Regels zijn natuurlijk nooit leuk. Naast Airbnb communiceren wij de regels nogmaals, om teleurstellingen te voorkomen. Ik begrijp dat het communiceren van de huisregels vervelend kan overkomen. Zoals je zelf ook aangaf begreep je deze huisregels en vond je deze ook niet vreemd. <br/><br/>Je verblijft in Amsterdam waar helaas veel mensen de standaard normen en waarden zijn verloren. Gelukkig geef je dit ook aan in je eigen review. Voor onszelf, de buren en de stad Amsterdam zijn wij graag duidelijk naar onze gasten voor het juist naleven van de regels. Als host vinden wij het erg belangrijk dat er geen overlast is voor ons, de buren en de stad Amsterdam. De boete waar je het over hebt is overigens geen financi√´le boete. Bij overtreding van de huisregels wordt de reservering direct gestopt. Een overtreding is: roken binnen het pand, gebruik van drugs binnen het pand, overlast en/of feesten binnen het pand, het uitnodigen van extra gasten boven de maximaal 4 toegestane gasten/personen, etc. Dit zijn nu eenmaal regels die eigenlijk iedere host in Amsterdam dient na te leven om de stad Amsterdam leefbaar te houden. <br/><br/>Nogmaals thanks voor het publiekelijk delen van je ervaring en tof om je binnenkort weer te mogen verwelkomen! Thank you Luci, it was a great pleasure to meet you. Best Ralf Thanks Alexander! Lovely to host you! Thank you, it was a great pleasure Thanks and see you a next time Thanks Jesper for your stay. It was a big pleasure to host you and yes, hopefully I will see you a next time üëç Thanks! It was a pleasure to meet you! Hope to see you again. Thanks Laurenz! It was lovely to meet you. See you a next time. X Ralf Hee Erwan, thanks for you stay. It was great to meet you! See ya It was a big pleasure to meet you Joel, many thanks for your review and hopefully I will see you again! Best Ralf It was nice to meet you, see you again. A big pleasure to meet you ! Thanks for your stay. Thanks for your stay. I am a little bit disappointed about the heating point, no worries, but as explained, you didn't know how a innovative (modern) heating system works in the basics. You put yourself a heating program in the heating system. Because this the system works automatically on your programmed times. You didn't know how to remove this and we resolved this shortly for you. Hi Leandro It was a big pleasure to meet you. Thanks for your review and i will see you soon. x Ralf Hi Coral, It was lovely to meet you. Thanks for your review and i will see you soon. x Ralf Hi Jelena, It was nice to meet you. It makes me happy that you enjoyed my crib so much. Thanks for your review and i will see you quickly x Ralf Heey Craig, it was very cool to meet you. It makes me happy that you enjoyed my crib and the perfect location so much. Thanks for your review and i will see you soon again x Ralf Thanks Stuart. Thanks for your review and tip Marie. A few other guests also asked for an extra door to the bathroom, to make it more privat then it was already. We listen to our guests carefully to give them the perfect stay. <br/>We placed this extra door to the bathroom direct after your check-out. You can see this on the pictures now. So the bathroom and toilet are now extra privat. <br/>Its correct that there is no full equipted kitchen, but to be clear. You booked the privat room and not a full equipted appartement. The price is also low of the accomodation and it was not the price of a full appartement. I think its a little bit strange that you mentioned this. <br/>But no worrys, we already planned to install a new fully equipped kitchen in the next weeks. This because we find it is extra usefull to have this so closeby the roofterrace. Andrei, many thanks for your stay. It was a pleasure to meet you and to share the lovely hotspots and feelings of our great city Amsterdam. Hopefully we will see you again. All the best! Thanks Timothy, it was a big pleasure to see and host you. See you next time! Many thanks and all the best, Ralf Thanks Thomas, it was a big pleasure to see and host you. See you next time! Many thanks and all the best, Ralf Thanks for your tip, Jackie. Because a few other travellers, who don't know eachother very well, also gave us the tip to place an extra door in front of the bathroom, we decided to place an extra door in a short time. To be clear, a lot of other travellers like this modern and semi open architecture. But it is for us very important that all the travellers feel comfortable and have a lovely stay. Many thanks again for your tip! Thanks Matthew, it was a pleasure to meet you! See you next time. Leah, thanks! It was nice to meet you. I am looking forward to see you the next time! Raymond, it was a big pleasure to host you and your family. I am looking forward to see you the next time for a drink! Brad, thanks that you wrote a good and 5 star review. It was a pleasure to meet you. Next time we drink a beer! Hi Max. Thank you for sharing your experience. The apartment is located on the 2nd floor which is accessible by normal staircase. There is nothing dangerous at this stage. Indeed there is no elevator, as in any historic building in Amsterdam city center. The description and photos are exactly as in reality. With the check you were very happy (awesome happy) and I even helped you to wait a much longer than the check out time. I am disappointed in the sharing of inappropriate information. The profile is clearly stated that there is one bedroom. You indicate that the house is not suitable for 8 guests. You had a) No booking with 8 guests and b) 8 guests are not welcome. I do not understand why you share this information. The oven is works correctly. You dont send me a message to explain how you can use the oven. "
10232506,"Thanks for staying with us and for your nice words! :) Thank you, you're welcomed to come back :) It's sad to see you make things up. <br/>You took the key with you and refused to  return it, way past your check-out time because you were ""too tired"". And you didn't give a toss about our key arrangement which was agreed with you and your sons. I wouldn't mind if you've told me one or two hours in advance that you will be out and the key is with you. But you didn't! And Reka has previously discussed with you how this will affect the next guests if you are not there on the agreed time, given we gave you both key sets. You also pushed to check out as late as possible, we agreed on it, no problem! Airbnb is not a hotel and you should accept that returning the key is important as well as respecting the house rules. Other guests had to wait because of you. This is was unfair for them. I didn't demand anything of you other than respecting the checkout times and the house rules. That's all! <br/>I really don't understand what happened to you, our communication was great at the beginning and then you didn't make much sense anymore. You can do whatever you want with your time, money and your vacation, is not my business, but keep a clear head and take responsibility for your actions.  You've been rude with me and Reka when we reached you by phone, and you were barely being coherent in your speech.<br/>Your money can't buy your lack of responsibility<br/>or lack of respect towards other people. I'm sorry but it doesnt work that way. <br/>Your complains are made up simply because we asked you to return the key - this whole issue could have been avoided in the first place if you would have dropped the key as we agreed.  Thanks for staying with us Tayler :) Thanks Francesco! Glad you liked the place. Great to have you as guests!  Communication was managed well by Adam and they left the place is good order :)  Great guests, communication was managed well by Vanessa and they left the place as they found it, clean and in good state. I highly recommend Vanessa and her friends as guests! "
10302269,"Thank you very much Thank you Julian !<br/>Always welcome back in amsterdam thank you!<br/>i just arrives back home and all was very good. with lots of love for the cat.<br/>higly recommanded this friendly guest. I am sorry to hear that there where so many things not good. <br/>I had this time another person to do the cleaning and keys than I normally have . And they didn‚Äôt do it like I discussed with them . The let my and so you as wel , down. <br/>My own housekeeper who does the cleaning normally was  away so I asked for this time someone else . With this bad result of keeping my house clean and good for you. <br/>Due I was in holiday I asked them to go back and clean , but unfortunately they didn‚Äôt.<br/>You can see at my other feedback that this is not the way I am used to rent out !<br/>So very sorry for the trouble ."

10484870,"Thank you so much for sharing your experience and for your appreciation Maureen! Thank you so much for sharing your experience Ankit, so happy to hear you have enjoyed my home! Always welcome back! Thank you so much for your lovely words Kevin, I‚Äôm really glad to hear you‚Äôve enjoyed everything so much! It was wonderful to have you, always welcome back! Hello Dylan, thank you for your feedback, very happy to hear you have enjoyed your stay! I‚Äôm sorry to hear about the smoke. We are constantly busy to improve the isolation of the building and we will continue to do so. Furthermore there is an airfilter situated in the apartment, which usually works perfectly in preventing any nuisance from smoke. As it is my private home and I am non-smoker too, clean air is of course also very important to me. However, when I came home after your visit, I noticed that the airfilter was switched off. Maybe you have done this accidently (as it is next to the router)? It‚Äôs now turned back on, and the air is clean again. <br/>Thank you again for your stay and feedback. Thank you so much for your kind words Ibrahim! It was great to have you! Welcome again!"

10585553,"Thanks for your reply. <br/>Vondelpark is about 5 min by bike/tram.<br/>Leidseplein is about 10 min by bike/tram.<br/>Museum Square is about 15 min by bike/tram.<br/>Central Station is about 30 min by bike/tram."
10604372,"Thanks for the feedback, in reply to that. You can easily control the heating yourself, but‚Äôs it correct that it turns down at night to 19C. Most people like that and it‚Äôs better for the climate/ we‚Äôre in a gas crisis. Christopher wanted to keep it at 25C, so we arranged that for him. The BNB is a stand alone on private floor but indeed attached to our house (that is the law in Amsterdam). Sorry to hear about the cleaning Christina, I'll talk to our cleaner. Thanks Carola for your feedback! It was great having you guys. I'll tell Joseph from the Italian restaurant that you liked his food/service :)"

10811675,Thank you for the bottle muscato! :-)
10844398,"Hi dear Mary and thank you for taking the time for writing such an extended review. Although I have to admit that I‚Äôm rather disappointed to read the least positive review I‚Äôve ever received since listing my place 10 years ago. Especially since I‚Äôve personally helped you out with looking into public transportation to visit Keukenhof, presented you to - on check out day - stay as long as you wished to make travel back easier and offered you to, at any time, get in touch with me in case of questions or for recommendations. I also do have to respond to your remark about cleaning since you suggest the bathroom wasn‚Äôt clean. I strongly have to disagree with that. The marks that you have seen are lime scale/calcium and haven‚Äôt come off after several times of intense scrubbing. I‚Äôd rented out my place for half a year a while ago and it consistently wasn‚Äôt cleaned which left those marks. I‚Äôm sorry that you‚Äôve experienced this calcium as dirt. But since I - in your case - personally double checked the whole cleaning I know it was spick and span - I‚Äôm slightly ocd when it comes to cleaning. Also it saddens my heart to read that you don‚Äôt have anything positive to say about my place other than the shower pressure or light - even though I got you a fresh bouquet of blossom branches. And feel like my place has so much character with original antique details and all the items<br/>I have collected over the world in the past 10 years. But hey - tastes differ and it is what it is if this was your actual experience. And bearing that in mind I would respectfully like to withdraw the last sentence of the (5 star/excellent) review I left you. Stating that you‚Äôre always welcome back. I feel like it is a complete different category of place that might suit you better; with an elevator and more modern spacious lay out than my original 18th century apt. So kindly note that for future reference it might be better to stay in Amsterdam North or something similar. Thanks so much for your kind words!"
10945068,"Thank you for your feedback. We will improve the storage space. For other guest, please note it‚Äôs our family home where we normally live, so it‚Äôs not clinically perfect, but how we like it to life in. A larger living room can not be found in our neighborhood. Thanks Emma for the nice review! Just found the key."
10965305,"Hi Paul, sorry to hear that you had problems with the stairs, that is unfortunately the way the houses are built in Amsterdam!"
11001794,"Dank voor je lovende woorden! Dank voor je verblijf en je enthousiasme! We are very sorry for Sawsane and her mother that they had to leave prematurely. We live in the old city center and sometimes we have some mice issues. The mouse exterminator has come to the appartment (and the rest of the house) today to do a total check and that is how all the hotels/ houses in Amsterdam solve this issues. So sorry Sawsane to read your disappointment. Thanks for your stay and thanks for taking the time for all the feedback! thanks for your stay and your kind words!! Thanks so much for your stay in Amsterdam! ahhh thanks you so much, especially because you were so easy goinig with the workers in my house!! So nice of you Claudia!! great!! Thanks a lot Hi,<br/>I am Very sorry to read this. The (biggest) supermarket ( of Amsterdam), is around the corner. You can put the chairs on your own terrace on the canal. So i don‚Äôt really understand your critics. Yes, the kitchen is small, but it is written in the advertisement. Thanks Darren, I am glad you enjoyed your stay Great! Great! Hi Rebekah,<br/>thanks for your response. I know we had some electrical issues and we have solved the most important one and the next will be fixed in a week. The mould is the reaction of a not functioning ventillator, that will be fixed this wednesday. <br/>I am glad you received our refund and your forgotten purse! great, i am aware of the little electrical problems and they are almost solved. Thanks for your stay! Thank you so much for your wonderful feedback and: CONGRATS!!! I am Sorry to read this. And haven‚Äôt heard these complaints before. Thanks for the feedback. I bought some new sheets and pillows and changed the roller blinds at the door. The lighting works, you just have to pull the  strings in the bathroom! Thanks for your feedback, Lori Lee. You can use everything in the house, so the plates are in the big closet. I am sorry you did not fond the utensils, but there is a little suitcase on the glass table where you find everything you need for a little meal. Thanks for the feedback. The mold issue is almost solved! Hi Alexia, <br/>Thanks for your comments. Please note that you did not pull out the couch as much as possible. Normally the cleaning lady does that for you, but the coauch really is big and comfy enough to sleap on. I never heard any problems with that.<br/><br/>Ciao Dear Johnny, we loved to have you as our guests! Ads for the two things mentioned that did not work: we fixed it. Hope to see you again!"
11319500,"Hi Paul,<br/>I am very sorry about the bathroom. I obviously forgot t clean it, which is a first for me! We had to rush to the hospital and probably that is why I messed up.

11353909,"Dank je wel voor de feedback! Fijn dat jullie zo hebben genoten van het huis en de locatie! Zal jullie feedback zeker doorvoeren en dingen waar mogelijk veranderen voor de volgende gasten. Annie and her friends were great guests and very nice to communicate with. Thanks for leaving the house clean and feeding my cat! Please read the other -all very positive-reviews first before believing any of Oscars accusations/lies. The thing is, that on my return -after complaints of neighbours about noise and heavy drinking- I found my house very very dirty and damaged. I confronted Oscar with this and asked him to pay for this damage. Instead of saying sorry for the mess they made, he is now making up these lies about my advertisement. This bad experience has convinced me never to allow groups of younger people in my house anymore. Sorry for the younger groups who do know how to behave, but I love my house and want to keep it nice and clean for myself and people renting it. Emma and friends were great guests. She communicated friendly and promtly. I was happy that she also fed and loved my cat  :)"
11394351,Thank you for this nice review Austeja - it was a pleasure to host you! üôÇ üôèüèº‚ú® Merci Matheo - very nice of you!<br/>Bas
11408530,"<3 Oh dear! How Sweet of you all! Reema entered our home last night at mid night and said: MAMA Krakova is in our kitchen!<br/>Wish we had met you too! You seem like artistic and nice people!<br/>Warm warm wishes and as the Dutch say: Tot ziens! Welcome back! &lt;3"
11413756,"Hi Anna,<br/>we are very sorry that your stay wasn't up to your expectations. We do however want to address some of your remarks. <br/>The loft bed is very clearly shown, with the ladder, in the photographs and descriptions in our listing. We are sorry you have not read and viewed the whole listing before making a booking request, it is advisable to always do so in order to avoid disappointment. It is also stated that the bathroom is located on the first floor and therefore we believe it is to be expected is to be not directly accessibele from the loft bed. <br/>Our cats are indeed mostly trained to be very friendly, having said that, they are trained not to go on the table when we eat and if they try we shove them away.  The truth about cats, we believe, however is that is never advisable to leave a tub of full fat yoghurt out unattended. They will eat it, whatever which way they are trained i'm afraid but we cannot speak for all cats of course. <br/>The cats never defecate in the house nor did we ever from over 90plus visitors have heard about them doing so. What you saw was probably vomit, from a hairball or grass-eating, something that we unfortunately cannot rule out for to happen.  (we also did not hear from you about this during your stay. then we could have explained)<br/>We normally personally introduce guests to our house but for this time the booking fell in the middle of our own vacation which made for one late reply. Also we protected the sofa's and the beds with sheet and blankets that were to be taken off so that the guest could have enjoyed the sofa's and beds more or less hairless upon arrival. (we say more or less because it's basically impossible to have a house without cat hair when cats are around.)<br/>We have checked all the towels provided and used, in ONE of them indeed is one hole, further no cat hair, no discoloration (we cannot judge priors smells after a week of use but we know they were freshly washed before your arrival). The towels we use for our guest are kept separate from our own and cleaned thoroughly after each booking. We are vey sorry about the whole in one of them, it must have occurred in a prior booking and we missed it in preparing the towels for your visit. <br/>Considering the size of our towels, they are standard 120 cm X 60 cm towels, of which there are two provided for each guest (the striped ones), on top of that we provide a larger bath towel (of which one had one hole) that are 160 cm X 80 cm. We believe these sizes are pretty standard in Europe. <br/>The cat food provide ran out close to the end of your stay and not in the middle as you state. We are sorry about that and will make sure to leave more cat food behind for our next guests. <br/>We are again sorry about your disappointing experience but would have loved to hear about the concerns expressed in your review (besides the cat food running out) during your stay instead of after, so we could have clarified some things or helped. <br/>We will however proceed to make directions more clear for future guests we do not meet in person, however, as stated, this does not happen very often. <br/>Lastly we want to stress, as we do in our listing also, that this is our private home that we share with two cats, and not a professional accommodation and we advice any interested future booker to form their expectations accordingly. We have always been as clear as possible about this and according to 90plus more than happy guests, we were. <br/>kindest regards Christian and Laura atherine and her family were so wonderful to have. She, her husband and their 18 year old daughter stayed in our apartment, parked their car in the neighborhood and explored amsterdam on the bicycles they brought themselves. There were absolutely no problems whatsoever, the house was incredibly clean, the communication perfect and the cats were totally relaxed and happy. After having welcomed over 20 bookings in our house the cats have shown themselves a perfect indicator for guest behavior. In this case they must have been really sweet to them. We would without hesitation recommend them as your guests. Katherine stayed in our apartment with two friends during the Amsterdam Dance Event. given the nature of that festival and the late hours of the events during that festival they were excellent guest. They behaved very well and there were no complaints or anything from the neighbors. When taken into account that Katherine and her friends were young and came to the city for a dance party they were great to have. The house and the cats were in fine condition. Madlen was a very nice guest to have, the whole was in good order and the cats seemed to have enjoyed their presence.<br/><br/>"

11609778,"We are surprised by Nuri's review, as it doesn't reflect the full story of her stay. <br/>While it's true that our building has steep stairs, this is clearly indicated in the listing, and guests have consistently found it no issue at all, as it's just one flight, andbecause they are aware of the layout, and read the listings' description.<br/>We also find it important to mention some issues from our side that affected the stay: Nuri did not arrive on the first night without informing us. Instead, her friend‚Äôs partner stayed without prior communication, which was a breach of our house rules, but would have been no problem at all, if they just checked if that was ok with us.  <br/>Additionally, there was a violation of the non-smoking policy, as the guests were smoking hash in the apartment, which impacted not only us but other residents in the building.<br/>As for the sound isolation, this has never been raised as an issue by previous guests. Our pricing reflects the location and the amenities offered, both of which are transparently listed prior to booking.<br/>It is unfortunate that Nuri chose to leave a negative review seemingly in anticipation of feedback on these matters. <br/>We strive to ensure a comfortable stay for all guests, but we expect the same respect for some simple and basic house rules in return. It was really nice to meet you all. I hope you stay with us again in the future. And maybe we come to Australi√´ once.  Thank you! welcome back anytime! Hi Isabelle, thank you so much for your great review and we hope you will comeback next time you will come to Amsterdam! All the best :) Hi Janne, so nice to read your language.

Chrissie was exactly the kind of guest that you like to host: neat, respectful and caring about my place. She was really friendly in general and I would love to welcome her back anytime. Definitely a recommendation! Valerio was a great guest that I would recommend to all hosts! He was very friendly, flexible and exactly the kind of guest that you like to have : respectful, neat, courteous and caring about my place. I felt very comfortable renting my place to him and would love to welcome him back one day!"

11929685,"Ha! Yes, those infographics on the washer/dryer combo are still a bit of a mystery to me. I just use the washing cycle and then hang dry‚Ä¶ but I do that anyway Hi Shannon and Davis!<br/>There are no cats in the house. We actually have cat allergies. <br/>We‚Äôll do a deep clean in the entry. Thanks for pointing it out Thanks Karen! Hope to see you again next time you are in Amsterdam Thanks for booking! Hope to see you back! Thank you Mathew! Come back anytime Thank you for the nice review. Even if the cleaning wasn‚Äôt quite on point. Hope to see you soon! We loved having you! We hope to see you again It is true that the stairs leading to the apartment are steep. It was in the advertisement, and I mentioned it again when booking. And actually our stairs are better than most old houses in Amsterdam, but wide and gentle stairs are not part of the Dutch life... Thank you Harley! The bathroom is indeed small! I thought of expanding it when I remodeled, but actually no where to go with it, so ended up trying to optimize the space I had‚Ä¶ Thank you for such a lovely review! We hope to see you next time you are in Amsterdam I'll see if I can find one that fits somewhere we can tuck away nicely in a closet. I've been thinking about that... Awww thanks so much! We enjoyed hosting too! Thank you Kara! It was a joy hosting you, your husband and your lovely kiddo's. Love their sense of adventure! Keep on exploring! Love it! Thank you for choosing our house! Come back anytime! Hi Albert - and the rest reading this. This house does have steep stairs. I mentioned it in the description, but always like to point out, that for older people, the stairs can be an issue. And to be fair, our stairs are wider and less steep than most in Amsterdam, it actually can be a lot worse! When it's clear that the group booking may have an issue with stairs, I mention it, but I didn't quite get that with Albert's group when they were booking. <br/><br/>So, caution to anyone booking and reading the reviews, while a lovely space, if you have an issue with stairs, then a hotel may be a better option, as most AirBnB's in the center of Amsterdam have steep stairs.<br/><br/>In spite of the surprise stairs, I hope you all enjoyed your stay. Thanks Andrew! It was a pleasure hosting you. I wish you would have said something about the heating!  And yep, the bathrooms are typical Amsterdam bathrooms....  Thank you for choosing our home!  Sorry the your van didnt fit, 2 meters high is the max, including any rails on top What Sarah says about the stairs is true.  That said, our stairs are far more civilized than the other historical houses in the neighborhood.   I always ask who is in the group to make clear that people with mobility issues are better off on the ground floor or with an elevator.  As far as kids go, mean mom that I am, as soon as they could walk stairs, I started making them walk the stairs. Thank you Oded!  Come visit us again! Thanks so much for the review Nick!  Hope you visit again! It was a pleasure having you in our home.  I'm pleased to here that you could appreciate all the sights our neighborhood has to offer and the unique fact, that it is so quiet in the house.  Those are the same reasons I love this house!"

12232781,"Sahsenem is a very good guest Hi Catrine, I am very sorry about the cat. It happens sometimes. I will put a bedlight in. Thank you for staying. Hi Olga, I tried to explain how the cat behaves, but you did not understand it. I am sorry. Thank you for staying with us in Amsterdam ! Sorry David, we did not have the flu but just a cold. I was exaggerating a bit... Hope you did not get a cold ! I checked Georgina in at 17.00 h. as agreed upon. Georgina had a headache and I gave her a painkiller when she asked. Friends of guests are not allowed in my place. It is a room for one person. Sorry Georgina ! Sorry Farid, I had no prioir message about what time exactly you were arriving. I left work early to let you in 15.00 h. Giovana did not arrive on the reserved date. I expected her and waited for her. The room remained empty. Two days afterwards she wrote that she made a mistake in the booking. She had wanted to book 3 months later. I told her I was sorry but I could not give her back the money. It was not my mistake after all. We are letting a room without a kitchen. It was extra ordinarely cold at night. Extra blankets are always available on request. The wifi capacity will be enhanced in the next two weeks !"
12327340,"Ahh Joey, you're the best :-) Immediately I felt like we were from the same clan. You're so easy to get along with. Also a HUGE thank-you for your support right when support was needed, I'll never forget! Right guest, right time :)  So very much appreciated üëè ü§£ I luv that angle, I would've never thought üòä May have to add similar to my listing, thank-you.  It was such a pleasure to have you stay üôè Peony, it's special guests like you that have me luving this lifestyle. I am so glad we found each other üòä Lucas, I have another Lucas coming right after you, so I had to warn him, he has a lolot to live up to with his name sake ü§£ü§ó Interesting points to note, thank-you.<br/>Bedding - All bedding is washed, 100%. The machines were in fact running when the girls arrived. If there is a stain that was missed by the cleaners or myself, just let me know, easy changed. Small stains are for my personal bedding, large stains I throw out. I have too much bedding, so please, indeed, help me declutter.<br/>Cleaning - The apartment was cleaned before Houda‚Äôs arrival. They stayed two nights. I knew young girls can be messy, so I didn‚Äôt review that way myself, I just anticipated lots of hair left in the bathroom etc. I do advertise that this is a ‚Äúlive like a local,‚Äù and to clean up after yourself. Sometimes I do wipe benches etc after people anyway, however I was at the tail end of having spent 11 days in hospital with my now late friend (who passed away 2 days after the girls departure), and therefore I was not home during the day and evenings to clean up after the girls, and was pretty exhausted at night. I did block off all rooms that were not booked during this time I was at the hospital, and did advise booked guests of the situation so they could cancel, as I didn‚Äôt want to cancel on guests myself, yet I guess there‚Äôs the pitfall. As a positive, the other guest at this time, she brought me a bottle of wine to relax one night üòä I do have the best guests üòä <br/>Anyway, solution, for future guests, if you want more cleaning done after yourself, during your stay, fair enough, you are on holidays, just let me know in advance, and we can arrange the cleaners to come extra for you. <br/>Three per room - I am surprised that Houda was surprised with the set-up. Having three to a room only started due to a guest really wanting this, stating they‚Äôd sleep on the ground. I caved, then found a solution, as I couldn't have them on the floor, so I purchased an air mattress for them. Since then, I do write extensively about the set-up, that if this is what they want, the room is as per pictures, one large bed per bedroom, and therefore a blow-up bed is the solution. I only have three sleeping places, two beds, one per bedroom, and then the air mattress for that odd occasion. I also suggest to all ‚Äúit‚Äôs best to also book the other room,‚Äù and I send photos so the potential guests can see what the room looks like with the airbed laid out, then ask if they understand the set-up, and if this matches their expectations, hence why I am surprised the girls were unaware of the set-up. I‚Äôm not sure what to add, so ‚Ä¶<br/>Solution ‚Äì generally the only condition I had with three to a bedroom, was dependent on if there was a guest(s) in the other room or not, to not overcrowd, and for legality and safety purposes. I did not want to discriminate based on any other factors, hence would agree, or not, to three in a room, purely based on the number in the other room. This is only for the benefit of the guests anyway, and is of no benefit for myself. I‚Äôm a people pleaser üòä From now on tho, I‚Äôll do more due diligence, and indeed determine if three can go in a room, based on more criteria than just the number of guests in the other room, and I will therefore minimize more guests from having three in a room, in future, just in case. <br/>Stairs - Yes we are on floors 3-5, no real solution to the stairs situation, neighbours aren‚Äôt keen for a lift (I‚Äôve tried üòâ ). Only solution is to highlight this more, yet it is already outlined in the description, like ‚ÄúAnne Frank stairs,‚Äù and per pictures, and per floor plans that are included. I‚Äôve already exceeded the word count in the listing, if you can believe that üòâ , so not sure what to take out in order to write further about the stairs. Any suggestions / solutions are much appreciated. Thanks for your feedback Martina, much appreciated. For future guests, to address Martina‚Äôs key points:-<br/>1.	Check-in method:- Yes, there is a key / code method. If you‚Äôre uncomfortable with using either the code, or key, let me know in advance, and let‚Äôs implement a work-around to your liking. I can ensure I‚Äôm home to let you in (you get to know your guests, so I ensured I was home for Martina‚Äôs arrival, as I had that feeling), or I can further explain in person, by a call, or text, how codes work. <br/>2.	Finding check-in instructions:‚Äì Airbnb releases these a few days prior arrival. If this is difficult for you to locate, perhaps advise Airbnb, as hosts are unable to change the platforms set-up. I do send all guests an automated message prior arrival, asking if they‚Äôve read and understood the self-check-in instructions, and if any questions. I also outline where to locate the instructions, via their booking on the app, by clicking on the button ‚ÄúCheck-in,‚Äù else on the website, or by an email Airbnb sends. <br/>3.	Instructions availability in other languages:- Airbnb also provides instructions in the bookers native language. I can‚Äôt vouch for the accuracy in translation, yet any confusing translations, feel free to ask Airbnb or myself for clarification.<br/>4.	Communication:- ‚ÄúThe day before ‚Ä¶ nothing was answered.‚Äù 36 written (hence verifiable) text messages, via Airbnb and WhatsApp, were exchanged between Martina and myself the day before arrival (and a lot more before and after this period). All questions were answered including giving more explanation on finding the instructions, and even forwarding the instructions in both English and Italian. Martina even wrote back saying ‚Äúfound it,‚Äù and also sent me the instructions, in both English and Italian, the day before arrival. All other questions were also answered, about early check-in, a late check-out, hair dryers, linen and towels, to explaining government fees and taxes etc. Therefore the guest did have visibility of the instructions the day before, and everything was answered, in writing, verifiably so. <br/>5.	Translation solutions:- Having travelled in 113 countries, 14 years of working and living in a foreign country, and living with people where English is not a first language for decades, translation solutions have become second nature to use. I‚Äôve also excitedly shown many, many people translation tools. Many guests who don‚Äôt speak English at all have stayed, and it‚Äôs never been an issue before. We can talk into Google translate, and it talks back in our own language. We can hoover google translate camera over signs, menus and paperwork, or your laptop, for automatic translation. You can text me in your language, and I can use a translating app to reply in your language. Also, chatting via Airbnb automatically translates. Also, Google Chrome has automatically translated all my web browsers daily for 14 years now, I highly recommend. Perhaps, as Martina wrote and spoke English well, I didn‚Äôt realize it was an issue for her. Hence please, any future guests who don‚Äôt feel comfortable with English, and I don‚Äôt pick up on it, please let me know, and we can have some fun playing with apps, and Charades üòä<br/>6.	Room size:- Yes, the room will always be the same. There are two bedrooms for B&B. There is only one large bed per bedroom. This will not change regardless of your booking. Each bedroom is bookable under separate listings. Martina inquired for 3 (yet only booked for 2). Upon inquiry, I advised she is best to also book the second room, yet also advised her of the airbed option if she did not want to pay for a second room. Martina did reply ‚Äúso if there‚Äôs an inflatatble bed options, we will use that.‚Äù So this should not have been a surprise. Yes, if there are 3 guests, I do advise to book both rooms, else there‚Äôs the airbed possibility. If there are too many people already booked in the other room, then I will not allow three in a room due to overcrowding, legal and safety reasons, hence the airbed will not be an option. If each person must have their own bed, then I suggest looking for either a hostel, a bedroom that does have three beds in it, a place that has three bedrooms, or a set-up to your liking. My rooms are exactly as advertised. If this is not to your liking, then indeed it is best, for all of us, if you find a listing that does fit your needs.<br/>7.	Instructions explained:- Instructions are explained, and word count is maxed out. I‚Äôve been advised instructions are very thorough. When guests arrive, I‚Äôll determine if they are guests that want to be shown around, or left to their own self check-in demise. As you prefer. When Martina came, we spoke briefly at the doorway, entrance to the lounge. Her aura was that she really did not want to speak further, didn‚Äôt want to come in the lounge, and just walked up the stairs to her room while being greeted. With her body language and vocals, I wrongly assumed she wanted to be left alone at this point. My mistake. Indeed, if you do prefer verbal instructions, please advise, else I may indeed ‚Äúread the room‚Äù wrong.<br/>8.	Hair dryer:- Response came the day before arrival when asked via text. Two are in the bathroom. The larger one hanging up on the right of the sink. The smaller, less heavy one in the bottom drawer, requires an adaptor, and sometimes guests accidentally take my adaptors, hence please bring your own travel adaptor. <br/>9.	Adequate pricing:- I assume the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù was covered above. If not, well yes, this is Amsterdam‚Äôs pricing, however feel free to find another place that is more befitting to your value for money expectations.<br/>Please practice your ‚ÄúDutch directness‚Äù with me (while in Rome üòâ ) and ask, or share your feeling at the time, so that I am able to help. Call if any emergencies as I‚Äôll wake up to calls and not texts. Thanks for your feedback Joanne, much appreciated. <br/>Perhaps providing a bit more detail as to why you feel the price/quality wasn't to your expectations would be helpful. This way I can correct my listing where it may be misleading, for future guests happiness. It's also a shame to hear, especially when you visited for Taylor Swift, and my b&b was pretty much the cheapest in town during her tour. <br/>Ps. I've, as a postal exception, posted your forgotten item back to you and you should receive this shortly. For future guests, postal services are definitely now closed, no more final exceptions (except ... ü§£), so please ensure you have all your belongings prior departure. <br/>Please also ask for any clarifications you may have, on the listing, prior booking, to ensure your contentness. I definitely prefer people to stay who are satisfied, as the most important thing is to enjoy Amsterdam, and to enjoy your home away from home üòä To future guests, please advise if you see stains you don't like and we can simply adjust accordingly. Carly did stay for 7 days, so there was plenty of time to address her requests had I known. There's loads of bedding, and regularly new purchases, such as fitted sheets a few days ago a guest actually brought upstairs when delivered (thanks Laure). The cleaners or I may miss a stain so just yell out. I even have linen shelves organised as top shelves are best and for guests, to lower shelves for me üòÑ <br/>Likewise, I've actually spare curtains and shower curtains in the laundry. Only stains I've noticed on curtains are when people move the blinds with dirty hands (food stains mainly - please wash your hands after food and before touching curtains; bathroom is just next door), hence can be washed out, with a replacement curtain hung. Room 4's curtains, and shower curtain, were changed and washed a few weeks ago, yet room 3's didn't need it at that time. Likewise, current shower curtain was an expensive fabric, white, anti-mold, a few months old. Even tho recently washed, it wasn‚Äôt mold, yet stained on the rim of the curtain, floor end, and although it's machine washable, I just today put it through and the stain didn't come out (backup grey one currently in its place). So lesson learned, it's not worth buying expensive white when it comes to shower curtains ü§£<br/>Curtains aren't looked at regularly, not everything is, so again if you do pick up on something that makes you uncomfortable, please point it out during your stay so it can be adjusted for your comfort, as well as for future guests. Unfortunately I just read this feedback, after the current guests checked in, and wasn't advised of this before reading the review, so now, to disturb current guests or not to disturb them, that is the question ... <br/>As for privacy, yes if you want to access the kitchen and loungeroom floor, there may indeed be other people there, it's a room to rent/shared place, and not whole place for oneself. If you do want privacy tho, people quite easily and quietly go up the stairs in the stairwells to the bedroom floors unnoticed. Bedroom floors are mostly quiet. Hope this clarifies the set-up. <br/>Any questions ask away, and please during your stay advise me if you need anything so that I am able to help at the time, don't hesitate üôè Yes that is correct, each bedroom has only one bed (EU King or EU Double, as shown in the pictures, and as described in the captions), yet are only bookable for 2 persons max (not 3). <br/>Only one bed/bedroom is bookable per listing. If you want to book both bedrooms, then you must do so under the two separate listings (both listings are found under the filter ""private room,"" not ""whole place""). <br/>The room Stefanie booked has an EU King size bed, and can only be booked for 1 or 2 people. If there are 3+ people, this must be declared upon booking to see what can be arranged. There is also a second room bookable for B&B. If there are more than two people, best to book the second room also, or if Stefanies two guests she booked for wanted separate beds/rooms, then the second room needed to also be booked. Often friends, couples, family, colleagues etc are fine to share a bed, yet if not, the second room is also bookable. <br/>I hope this clarifies the write-up/pictures/set-up for Stefanie and future guests. Any further queries or clarification required please message me. I'm not sure what Anna is referring to with ""unreliable."" She successfully self checked-in 6 hours before the check-in time, at her own leisure, hence all was clear/reliable here. All her texts were answered quickly (though my reminders and updates weren't replied to, yet that's ok). We never actually met in person during her one night stay, yet all our texts were standard, and no complaints before hence not sure what was unfriendly. I'm really unsure what she meant by unreliable when all her expressed needs were met in a timely fashion. Examples, or a little more context to the constructive feedback next time will be more beneficial, and therefore also helpful for future guests benefit and comfort ... Lisa advised of an 8:15am arrival time, 7 hours prior check-in, to drop off luggage. Lisa arrived and left before the designated cleaning / preparation time between guests, and before the current guests checkout time. She was aware of this, and agreed to this. My automated pre arrival message, along with my advert, both clearly reflect guests can leave their luggage ‚Äúin the lounge,‚Äù this was indeed made clear twice. Even if not clear, one must think what to expect? This is not a 5 star hotel with bell closet (which can be generally accessed by more guests and employees than will be here anyways), this is a ‚Äúself-check-in‚Äù accommodation (hence denoting an employee will not be present), and the bedrooms are not available before check-in time to leave belongings in, as they are likely occupied, or not prepared until the check-in time. The write-up also clearly expresses this is shared accommodation and not a private place to rent, therefore expect there may be other people here. The place in fact wasn‚Äôt that bad and the cleaner had only been a few days earlier (to manage expectations I advise in my write up of a weekly cleaner of common areas), and the cleaner did spend some hours until Lisas 3pm check-in time preparing (tho not 7 hours before check-in when Lisa came and went). I‚Äôll review whether to continue with early baggage drop-off possibilities based on this feedback, and shall this be continued in future, please keep your eyes closed in the house until the 3pm check-in time   ;-)  Anything pre check-in time is null and void. <br/><br/>Per spa bath and roof ‚Äúarea,‚Äù (very thoughtfully worded to not offend anyone‚Äôs definitions) please check the pictures. If the pictures don‚Äôt reflect what is in your head, then it probably doesn‚Äôt exist the way you imagine, therefore feel free to clarify with me pre booking. <br/><br/>Per locks, there are locks on the bathroom and toilet doors. My advertisement is transparent, advising why no bedroom locks, and to bring locks for your luggage, for your piece of mind (in over 50 houses, living in 6 countries, I‚Äôve never lived with locks on bedroom doors, with no issues to date (knock on wood). T‚Äôwas the way I was raised, honesty policy works, we‚Äôre all in it together). <br/><br/>Per fridge, the fridge closes, is cool, hence smell should not drift out of it. Not sure what food was in there, can‚Äôt remember any blue cheese etc yet I do not restrict any foods brought by guests. Rules are guests clean up after themselves (remove your food waste), and not following these rules leads to fridge being cleared making room for new guests. If I‚Äôd been strict on the guest adhering to check-in time, this again would not have been an issue. I refer to food smells over rotten food as I‚Äôve lived with three head chefs consecutively for the past 6 years, and the current one was surprised at this comment ‚Äì he is fastidious and said he‚Äôll tell you from two floors up if there‚Äôs something rotten. <br/><br/>Yes, mirror had such a symmetrical break, prior guests thought this was an art piece and its presence offended no one else. It was still useable and out of the way, hence stayed until it‚Äôs replacement came the day before Lisa‚Äôs arrival, and then the cleaner took it on her way out prior Lisa‚Äôs check-in time. Seeing as Lisa was sensitive to this, again if I had‚Äôve enforced no early entry pre check-in, guest would have been none-the-wiser. Please note last year there was a broken chair, one guest thereafter had a replacement chair in the room for a week, and 4 years ago a coffee pot was broken (there are a few other coffee machines and a kettle useable until replacement came). If you are sensitive to such things, please perhaps a hotel will suit you better. These things do happen in peoples homes, and this is a home. <br/><br/>Per xxx doll, yes I allow things in the lounge. Guests should feel at home. Guests can leave stuff post 1pm check-out time (also now to be reviewed). Lisa‚Äôs predecessors did in fact leave prior 3pm (documented) hence again, had I enforced check-in time, Lisa would have again been-none-the-wiser. Again, if early baggage drop is agreed to in future, please keep your eyes closed until 3pm in the house. Also, if you are sensitive to these things, best not to stay here. Per govt correspondence we are central Amsterdam (guests often think Central is denoted by the train station, Dam sqr, Leidseplein, Museum District, Red Light (all which are in fact to our North, East, and South) or other places). As we are in fact Central, you do see worse, live women, also worse paraphernalia, in shop windows, day and night, scattered throughout the center and outskirts, hence I‚Äôd actually suggest staying outside of Amsterdam. <br/><br/>Hope this clarifies the situation here. Please ask before booking on areas requiring further alignment. I prefer people who luv my home obviously, compared to the opposite. Regardless of where you stay, enjoy Amsterdam, I sure do ‚Ä¶    :-) I'm glad they 3 boys had fun. We enjoyed their company during this festive period also, and so did all my mates on the boat :-)<br/>Feb 10th Dimo booked. Same day I advised in writing I‚Äôd have multiple international friends staying in the lounge that weekend April 27th as it‚Äôs the biggest yearly festival of the country. I wanted to ensure guests liked this environment prior staying. He SAID yes, now it appears he wasn‚Äôt! This is frustrating! Only one friend ended up staying, not multiple, better even than I warned of, and Dimo‚Äôs party of 3 dominated the lounge, playing pool with my guest Steve, drinking & eating there every night, so I‚Äôm confused at his comment! <br/>Also, this is not a whole private property to rent, it‚Äôs a room to rent, hence please expect to share common areas. <br/>Therefore to all future guests, if I advise of a festival and that I‚Äôll have friends stay (as I‚Äôve warned current guests for gay pride in August), please listen to me, believe me, I am telling the truth and not just saying it. Heed my warning and take me at my word. It is our home, and therefore may have friends stay, yet will always give the courtesy of advising so. If this does not suit you, please DO NOT STAY. ONLY STAY IF YOU WILL LIKE THIS ENVIRONMENT during these occasions. <br/>A cleaner came the day of their arrival, and I did find myself cleaning quite a bit after the 3 boys. They did not wash their dishes, and didn‚Äôt wipe benches after themselves etc. Steve I have already whipped into shape and he also cleaned after them, and the cleaner who came when they were leaving said they played pool, then grabbed their bags and left with dishes and rubbish left out. A house rule is to clean up after yourself and before you leave. There is not an hourly cleaner to clean up straight after you, nor will I, hence PLEASE EXPECT TO CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELF for everyone‚Äôs sake (including your own). In the bedrooms, you need to turn the knob attached to the left side of the column heaters  on in order to turn the heater on. They are attached to the central heating. This way you can adjust the temperature to your liking. Just ask if you struggle. This is in the instructions. The girls also had problems with the self check-in as they did not read the instructions, so please read instructions or ask. This bedroom actually has a few months new ""double woolen"" winter duvet (not synthetic), 'twas my pride and joy when I brought it, hence surprised they found this not toasty warm. Another duvet is in the bedroom cupboard, and more in the storage unit. Just ask.  If you don't ask you don't get. Please communicate at the time so I can clarify before it's all too late. To be clear, I had a birthday party a few days before Romeos arrival. I enticed my party guests to have a good time, as I do every year. My friends are respectful, they did not trash/break anything. The place was dirty (to be expected when hosting a party) and was cleaned prior Romeos arrival. No one went into the bedrooms during the party except those staying in the rooms, and there was no broken or missing items as a result of the party, merely a cleanable mess in the common areas. If anything I was talking up the party and not down on my friends. I ""trash"" it every year during my yearly party, and love it ;-)  As for talking badly about other Airbnb guests, the only conversation Romeo and I really had was out the front with the neighbours, and can't really remember discussing any other Airbnb guests, except the other guys that also joined the neighbours for a drink recently and they were awesome, and one even came back again on his way back through. I can't think until this point of an Airbnb guest I didn't really like, they've all been awesome and I am loving this lifestyle generally. As for the office chair, I sent the very last guests a picture of the working chair with a towel dryng on it (thankfully, as is dated and proof showing it was in tact and not broken prior Romeos arrival). Romeo didn't like the ""tilt"" on it (as the prior person preferred to lay back in the sun on it), and instead of using the levers properly,  or asking me for help, he instead tried to force it upright manually and broke the back of the office chair off. This he admitted to in the messages after I asked him about it, and he mentioned the ""tilt""  (his words), although now it no longer tilts and just hangs. It is only the second item that has been broken in 4 years of Airbnbing thankfully (Airbnb can contest to this), and for this I am grateful. Romeo also brought another guest for the full duration yet only put one guest down on his booking and refused to change this. Amsterdam is generally a cold place therefore air conditioning is not widely found in houses. I've had a fan for 5 years and used it once. I brought the fan down into the common area for everyone to use although Romeo did want it only for himself in his room during the day, however I had to consider everyone and not just him, yet overnight Romeo did have the fan all to himself in his room, even though he does have the breeziest room in the house (being next to the roof area, keeping this open, and the bedroom window on the other side gives a nice through breeze up there). I guess Romeo was the one that got the preferrential treatment as he was the most demanding. Romeo did ask a lot of questions and I answered them all, and in the messages it mostly showed replies minutes apart, though sometimes I am socializing/working/cleaning/away from the screen and do not look for messages constantly, in which case best to call if an urgent reply is required as my phone is always on and in ear shot. They wanted the fan, that they got, washing soap for their clothes to use the washing machine, that they got etc. Everything they wanted they got. Not providing water, I do not understand this comment, I even showed them the glass cupboard and  the water is safe to drink in this country, I do not block anyone from using the taps, and the fridge is free for all to use, and yes I offered them a beer when drinking with the neighbours outside the house as that is what I had, my mistake I guess, not sure the point here.  There is a trash can in the bathroom (small metal with foot lever as in pictures, been there for years) and on every floor, hence unsure what this is all about? However he did leave a lot of mess in the bedroom on the floor, table, bed, desk and bedside drawer, therefore he obviously didn't go down two flights to put it in a bin. Yes the old Dutch buildings in central are known for their steep windy staircases, please be aware. I manage my snowboard bag filled to the max up and down the stairs so all is possible. As advertised we are on the 3rd, 4th and 5th floor. Please read when booking as this explains where your bedroom is situated. This should not have been a surprise as it is clearly indicated in the listing. He says I talked negatively about everyone who has given me a bad review? Off the top of my head, until this, I cannot remember anyone giving me a bad review to talk of. I will go back and re-read, yet not sure what Romeo is saying here. I do like constructive feedback as this is what enables one to grow and improve, and has lead me to installing smoke detectors etc, so please I encourage this and do not stop with your constructive feedback. I left Romeo a polite, short one liner public review as I have never left a bad review yet and couldn't bring myself to do so, then left the constructive feedback in the feedback section, perhaps I should however be more honest in future. Regarding constructive feedback given in this post, I'm not sure where Romeo is going with the water comment and other comments, however there's always one hey ;-)  "
12348866,"Helaas verliep deze boeking zeer problematisch. De gasten kwamen meer dan 4 uur te vroeg aan zonder toestemming, lieten de voordeur openstaan en het licht branden, en maakten de badkamer ernstig vies. Ze namen zonder overleg meerdere extra gasten mee en probeerden deze, ondanks een offici√´le waarschuwing via Airbnb, later opnieuw stiekem binnen te laten. Bij het uitchecken vertrokken ze veel te laat ‚Äì we overwogen zelfs de politie te bellen om de woning te laten ontruimen. Daarnaast verbleef er een extra persoon op de kamer zonder enige melding. Hun claim dat persoonlijke spullen op de grond zouden zijn gegooid is onjuist: een klein item werd netjes opzij gezet omdat er ruimte nodig was in de badkamer. Er was geen respect voor de ruimte, regels of communicatie. Absoluut geen prettige of veilige ervaring. Dus jij vond de etherische geurolie niet lekker  ruiken in de badkamer blijkbaar. Dat is geen stank en het beddengoed is vrijwel nieuw. De foto's kloppen helemaal en zijn door een Airbnb fotograaf gemaakt. Heb jij deze recensie wel bij jouw juiste verblijf geplaatst? You got 2 sets of 3 keys. One to lock your room, one for the appartment  and one for building.  You can adjust the radiator in the room for heat. You didn't say anything. What a totally dishonest review.  My phone is always in my bedroom and I don't use the alarm function on it ever. I warmed up your dinner. made you tea and you kept asking me about my girlfriend who came later that night. Thats was  strange. Most guests want to know about Amsterdam when they come and are not only interested in my personal life or what my girlfriend is doing at the moment. When my girlfriend arrived you were not interested anymore in me  or her. Room is ready at 16:00 but you can come drop your luggage from 11:00. Yes I was still busy fixing  and cleaning the room at that time you came, just had a check out but let you enter already. I told you the room was not ready and I would fix it asap.  I offered you a beer that night which you 3 wanted but then didn't drink it at all.  I drank them finally instead of throwing them away. When you went to bed the music went out in 5 minutes. Shame it was such a horrible experience for you and you gave  me a horrible rating for it. Yes I had some severe bad news that night, it showed while I tried to hide it. You didn't mentioned any of the minor things to me when you were at my place. The tv just needed to be plugged in for electricity and you could have washed your clothes at your son's house who lives very close by. You could have washed your clothes at the laundromat for 17,50 euro too. The 10 euro costs I charge for this extra was mentioned in front.  Pierre rented my private bedroom but expected a full apartment for himself. He never bothered to look up his booking and how it is listed. He just claimed to me that its very expensive my listing.  After this unpleasant talk with him he went out with his wife to get his son but he didn't close my front door and left it wide open when leaving which was very worrying for me. Pierre is type of guest that needs management when staying because of lack of responsibility.  Matthias booked my private bedroom but expects a total private apartment for himself it seems....  He doesn't communicate about it  with me and hide onlys in his private rented bedroom and moans afterwards about it in his  review. Matthias is a typical guests that refuses to read or check things up  and only looks at the pictures. Falsely accusing other people is no problem for him.   You booked for three person but demanded to stay with four persons at arrival which I didn't want. You tried to sneak that extra person in also. You lied to me and probably also to other hosts. You are utterly unfit with your rude behaviour and attitude for AirBnB. Im glad you went away and left my place. I won't advise you to any AirBnb host. You booked already another place in my house which I gave you all the time for. In two years hosting your my worst guest ever."
12379807,"Hello Laura and Guido, thank you for the wonderful feedback! <br/>I am happy you enjoyed your stay in my appartement. <br/>I wish you both a lovely rest of your stay in Europe! Oi Fab√≠ola, n√£o sabia que √© portuguesa/ brasileira! Que bom, meu portugu√™s n√£o √© muito elevado, mais eu tento. Se eu soubesse que √© portuguesa, eu apanhava a oportunidade de falar e praticar com voc√™! <br/>At√© mais üòâüëçüèº"
12426171,Dankjewel! Fijn dat jullie genoten hebben.
12448020,"Thankyou!! Wow Jason.  You have written such a lovely review about my bnb and me.  Thank you!! Hi Dave. Airbnb gives me the possibility to choose : a hotelroom (but it's not), an apartment ( it's not) so I choose the bed& breakfast option but in my advertisement I have told  there is no breakfast.  So you could have known it. But I understand you have been a bit confused. Airbnb does not give me the opportunity to choose a bed without breakfast... :-). And yes a spoon was missing, so I gave you, when you asked for that. The towels: What was wrong with that?  Anyway. I think you have been enjoying your stay ;-) Hi Carina. Indeed, the weather was really bad luck. But it is something which I can not organise for you. You are welcome to come back and I promised you 50% discount if you do. Hi Susan, thanks for your detailed and nice review. I like to tell my guests where to go, what to do and give them some tips when they arrive. But indeed: it is a good idea to make a list with my personal tips and send too my guests before they arrive, so people can already choose what to do when they are here. Nice idea!! Thanks a lot!! Dear Patty,  I am surprised about your review. You did not say or ask me something about this.  One table-fan is normal in our climate. The saturday you were here was indeed exceptional hot and sweaty.  This table-fan is 364 days a year more than enough and I have checked and the fan works good.  I think it was stuffy in every room in Amsterdam that day unless there is a good working aircondition-system. But I think only 1% of the Bed & breakfast rooms have airconditioning.  If you would have chosen a 4 star hotel maybe you will have airco and a canal view but ... .   I think the price will be 2 a 3x more expensive.  You can't have them all ;-) Wow, a lot of compliments, I start to be red :-).  Many thanks Hi Whitney. Yes, you have had the hottest day of this long hot summer so it has been warm in Amsterdam, also in your room on the 1e floor. This summer is extra ordinary warm. Nobody in the Netherlands is used to that.  But ... the room is not at the sunny side, you can open the window and/or use the ventilator ;-).  I hope you still had a great time !  And off course you will be very welcome back Jenna!  Hi Nicole, thanks for your compliments. My price of 85 for one night included a big breakfast in the best part of Amsterdam is based on 2 persons in the big bedroom. If you use one extra bedroom and use one extra bed I count 15,- extra. That is only 5,- per person per night. I think that is a very, very reasonable price.  But I have learned now. Next time when somebody wants to use an extra room + bed  I will tell the guests the extra costs. I really thought you noticed allready on the pricelist. I hope you still have a good memorie ;-)  Thanks for all your compliments, I get red ears of it ;-)  And yes, the extra van is needed in this very sunny summer!  Hi HuiQian, I did not reed you private feedback till today ;-)  Yes, the wifi is okay now. I bought something extra to install in the big sleeping room and now it is okay ;-)  You are very welcome next time!<br/>Warm regards and thanks for your positive review, Maria"
12607303,"Jullie zijn altijd welkom! Mark, ik ben heel erg geschokt door je review. Je krijgt een vroegere incheck van 4 uur en je waardeert dat niet. Ik verwelkom gasten graag persoonlijk omdat mensen dat waarderen, jij blijkbaar niet. In mijn advertentie staat dat ik geen keuken heb (wel koelkast en koffie & thee) en dat er geen tv is, dat je niet mag roken in de studio maar ook niet in mijn tuin. En dan ben je daarover boos. Dat is toch heel erg onredelijk, je kan beter goed de advertentie lezen. Ik heb redenen waarom ik kies voor mijn eigen inrichting en regels. En het centrum is echt geen 55 minuten lopen, dat argument klopt niet. Bussen rijden elke 15 minuten. De B en B is heel schoon, daar zorg ik echt voor. Eerdere reviews laten zien dat jouw feedback werkelijk absurd is. Ik wens je iets meer vriendelijkheid toe in je volgende verblijf. Je mag zeker feedback geven maar niet zonder gegronde argumenten. De wereld wordt hiermee niet mooier Ik ben verbaasd over je aankomst ster. Je vraagt om een vroege check in en komt vervolgens veel later zonder van je te laten horen. Ik vond het zeer onfatsoenlijk. <br/>Als je de locatie te ver vindt had je in het centrum moeten boeken. Alles is vindbaar op mijn pagina dus dat is je eigen verantwoordelijkheid. Hi Jan, thanks for the positive feedback! <br/>By the way the bathroom just had a renovation üòä other guests do appreciate that üëç Thank you so much! Welcome again Hi, I can not buy a new fridge immediately. I checked the fridge today and it is working well for a small one like this. Please take a Airbnb with a kitchen and a big fridge next time. Oh I am really sorry you misunderstood. I said that if you are cold let me know, then I immediately switch it on. Because many people are away during the day it is a waste to put the heating on unnecessary‚Ä¶ Dank je Karel! Ook nog bedankt voor je prachtige cd. Je bent zeker volgende keer weer welkom Thank you so much! Our private apartment is really private (everything private including entrance) what is a lucky thing if you book a private room ;-). Dank Frank! Je bent heel welkom voor een volgende keer Thanks you so much! Thank you so much! Welcome again :-) Thank you so much! You are welcome anytime Thanks a lot! Thank you so much Thank you very much! Thank you so much! You are very welcome again :-) Thank you very much!<br/> Thank you very much! Thank you!! Very welcome to come back again!! Thank you very much!<br/> Dank je wel!! Thanks and welcome back! Thank you so much! You where lovely guests!"
12679676,"Thank you for the review. I‚Äôm glad you enjoyed the apartment. I was having Christmas dinner with friends and family, that was probably what the noise was about. Normally I tend to keep very quiet. Take care. Thank you for the lovely words and it was a pleasure hosting you. I would like to respond to part of your review though to avoid misunderstanding for future guests.<br/>The apartment is close to the red light district, which is around the corner. The apartment is not in the heart of it though, with only residential buildings in the street. <br/>You can avoid the red light district completely if you like, although some noise can be noticed from the near by canals and/or the occasional passerby, as is stated in the listing. Especially in the weekends. The area is very safe though.<br/>Thank you again. And hopefully until next time! You can find in the description that I live in the apartment above. It‚Äôs true that it‚Äôs an old house with wooden floors and I always keep it down, especially after hours. <br/>Luckily for me you are the first guests to have a problem with this. I‚Äôm sorry it made your stay less pleasant. <br/>It does work both ways though. I was very clear you couldn‚Äôt sit outside on the patio after midnight and you woke me up at 2:00 am smoking outside. <br/>Also I was very lenient when you had friends over in the apartment late, although it states in the house rules this is not allowed.<br/>To be honest I‚Äôm kind of surprised by this review. Dear Marios,<br/><br/>I'm sorry to hear you didn't enjoy your stay. I do have some remarks though. In the total of two days you were staying you didn't even once complain to me about any of this. We even saw each other and just smiles. I try to be the best host I can be, attested by all the great reviews, but unfortunately I'm not a mind reader.<br/>I believe the guest is always right though, even after their stay. That is way I didn't hesitate to give you your money back, when you requested this through Airbnb afterwards. <br/><br/>I'm sorry you found the apartment unclean. It is always left as proper as possible in the time between guests, never had any complaints before. Unfortunately it may happen a cobweb is overlooked, sorry for this. <br/>As for the duvet cover, the white sheets come straight out of the wash and I didn't notice any stains. I apologize if I missed them. At least I'm relieved they were clean enough for you to sleep under for the two nights. If you would have told me the problem, I would have changed them in a heart beat.<br/>The same goes for the lightbulbs. I'm relieved there was enough light for you not to tell me during your stay. If you would have, I would have changed them as soon as possible. <br/>The light in the hallway is a bit of a hassle, as both switches, down and up the stairs, have to be switched on at the same time. I probably forgot to mention this during check-in. Again if you would have told me, I would have explained.<br/>As for the toilet paper. The first time you asked me was straight after check-in, when I forgot to put them in the bathroom after cleaning. I gave you two rolls immediately, one for each day of your stay. In my experience usually more than enough. The second time you asked was the next day I believe. I gave you two new rolls straight away. I'm glad in this case you had no problem asking me.<br/>Unfortunately it is an old house, as is typical in the Amsterdam city centre. The isolation is not as good as you would expect in a new house. I try to keep it down during late hours and when guests are home. Never had any problems before, but if you had let me know music was bothering you, I would have put on my headphones. As I always do listening to music during late hours.<br/>I have one central heating system in the house which is controlled from the top floor were I live, as I explained during check-in. I always have it on 21 degrees Celcius. If you are cold you can send me a message, as you did, and I will turn up the temperature immediately, as I did. I realize this is not the most practical system as you have to wait for the room to heat up. Usually the temperature is the same on all floors, I'm sorry this was not the case during your stay.<br/><br/>I apologize if you were left wanting for a message afterwards, let me use this instance to right that wrong. Thank you for staying at my apartment. I'm sad you were so dissatisfied with your stay that you didn't even contact me about it. I'm glad you at least got your money back. Maybe you can use it to pay for a place more to your liking on your next trip.<br/><br/>Kind regards,<br/>Thomas<br/> At times the neighborhood can get loud, but as it was Kingsday holiday, with literally millions wandering the streets of Amsterdam with parties everywhere, it was especially busy and loud in the entire city. If one is looking for a quiet time in Amsterdam I suggest avoiding Kingsday and Kingsnight."

12784049,"Hi Elisabeth an Janna. Great to hear you had such a lovely time during your stay at our place. Thank you for your feedback as we really appreciate you taking the time for improving our service. We do would like to clarify a few things. <br/>We have communicated upfront it‚Äôs only possible to store your luggage if we don‚Äôt have new guest coming on the same day. Therefor we did mentioned the luggagelocker as a plan B in our booking conformation.<br/>Also I think its important to say that our cats are hyper allergic (Siberian breed) as Lisa is also allergic to ‚Äònormal‚Äô cats. <br/>About the adress, sorry to hear you had some trouble finding it. We did check the written adress and everything seems to be correct on our page. At the moment there is some constuction work going on at our street. Of course, our building will be always accessible during the works. We hope to welcome you back some other time in the future, when the new terrace is ready for use. All the best, Lisa & Ruud Dag Mehmet. Wat jammer te horen dat je niet helemaal tevreden was met je verblijf. Onze prijs is echter niet alleen gebaseerd op de woning, maar ook zeker op onze centrale locatie. Onze zolder is wellicht aan de kleine kant, maar dit zijn wel de realistische maten die horen bij de appartementen in deze stad door de Amsterdamse bouwstijl; de vroegere pakhuizen. Wij proberen daar ook open en eerlijk over te zijn in onze advertentie, tekst en foto‚Äôs. Jammer dat dit bij jou niet zo is overgekomen. <br/>Wij gaan dit jaar een complete renovatie doen van de gehele verdieping. Wij hopen je in de toekomst nogmaals te mogen ontvangen en een andere ervaring aan te bieden. Hi Valerie. Sorry to hear you were not completely satisfied about your stay with us. You stayed with us for one night. We tried to do everything to make your stay pleasant. You mentioned in your review the stairs being a problem. We informed you in advance about the studio situated on the 4th floor. This is also mentioned on our AirBnb profile. Unfortunately your expectations didn‚Äôt match with the information we gave you upfront. If there is anything else we can change or improve, we are very open to hear your feedback. <br/>At the end, we hope you have enjoyed a great evening and appreciated the exclusive free evening tickets for the Vermeer expedition in the Rijksmuseum we arranged for you and your father. <br/>All the best, <br/>Lisa & Ruud We offer the possibility to stay with 4 guest, but we always warn guest that‚Äôs it‚Äôs not the most comfort. Therefor the price for extra guest is quite low. HI Clara, thank you for your review. Of course we regret your 3-star rating. It seems to be that your expectations did't match with our Airbnb. We would like to add some information to your review so the review is not misunderstood by other guests. <br/><br/>Staircases are small en steep in Amsterdam. These houses are built in 1906 and it's not possible to built in an elevator. There's no space and the construction is not suitable for it. When we're at home, we're always happy to help you with your luggage. <br/><br/>I think there was a misunderstanding for the use of the aircon. We only kindly requested to not to use it during the night when it's not necessary. We totally understand when you use the aircon on a hot summer day. <br/><br/>Thank you again for your feedback,<br/><br/>Lisa & Ruud Thank you for the feedback Caroline and I‚Äôm sorry to read that it was a disappointing experience for you. I‚Äôll check on the microwave. It needs to be replaced. Hi Aurelia, I‚Äôm sorry to read that the studio didn‚Äôt met your expectations. The bathroom is indeed very small but there is no extra space I can use to make it bigger. I would if I could. I try to be as honest as possible in the description of the studio. What you read and see is what you get. The prices are high in Amsterdam. I‚Äôm aware of that. Hopefully this all didn‚Äôt affect your stay in a negative way. <br/>Thank you for staying and for your honest feedback. <br/>Best wishes,<br/>Ruud Hi Ryan, thank you so much for this sincere and very positive review. You‚Äôre always welcome here! Thank you Imaan! Hi Bennity,<br/>Thank your for your kinds words. It was a pleasure to be your host in Amsterdam. I truly enjoyed your company in our house. We had fun! I hope we will meet again in the future so we can talk more about education. Sent love from me to your moms!   <br/>Best wishes,<br/>Ruud Hi Nicole, Thank you so much for your review! We are really grateful that you enjoyed! see you soon, Ruud & Diogo Hi Susi, Thank you so much for your review! We are really grateful that you enjoyed! see you soon, Ruud & Diogo Hi Joseph, Thank you so much for your review! We are really grateful that you enjoyed! see you soon, Ruud & Diogo Hi Mollie, It was a pleasure to have you all around! Thank you so much for your review! We are really grateful that you enjoyed! see you soon, Ruud & Diogo Hi Julian, Thank you so much for your honest review! We tried to do our best, with the space we have! Small room, however, big heart! We are really grateful that you enjoyed! see you soon, Ruud & Diogo Hi Vasilis, thanks for your review. We have around 400 reviews and hopefully people will make to check them. I can go on and on about this booking, however, I will only say what happens. You book directly, then wanted to cancel because we would not allow you to stay until 7pm in the next evening. You threatening me via message that I would not let you stay. Then you arrive at 2am in the morning, you smoke inside of the room, which made us cancel the next day booking, you try to get away with the extra person and you are still complaining? I am sorry but this is an unbelievable review and I will speak to airbnb about this. Best Regards, Hi Anne Laure, thanks for your review and for your comments! We are happy that you enjoyed your stay in Amsterdam! Ruud & Diogo Hi Mingzhi, Thanks for your review. We are happy that you enjoyed staying with us. Best Regards, Ruud & Diogo Hi George, Thanks for your review. We are happy that you enjoyed staying with us. And super thanks for your detailed review. De Pijp is indeed the place to be! <br/>Best Regards, Ruud & Diogo Hi Amy, Thanks for your review. We are happy that you enjoyed staying with us. <br/>Thanks for all your points! Amsterdam is known to be small. And the bathroom is not an exception. It is quite normal around here. <br/>Best Regards, Ruud & Diogo Hi Tim, Thanks for your review. We are happy that you enjoyed staying with us. Thanks for your detailed review. We hope to see you soon again. Best Regards, Ruud & Diogo Hi Kristian, Thanks for your review. We are happy that you enjoyed staying with us. Best Regards, Ruud & Diogo Hi Alan, Thanks for your review. We are happy that you enjoyed staying with us. We are glad you enjoyed staying with us. Best Regards, Ruud & Diogo Hi Susie, <br/><br/>Thanks for your review. We will take into consideration your points. However, from your review, I only see the negative points. Being a host yourself, you must know that everything that your reference - stairs, small toilet, lack of space, and mostly price - are characteristics of Amsterdam. I do not see any positive point, which makes me sad, when we facilitate check-in times, took the time to explain everything and we did not hear a complaint addressed to us regarding to any of the issues you were not aware of. You can see that are not only young people staying with us, neither it is an expensive accommodation. I guess you are not used to big cities and their issues. I would be glad if you had addressed us, so we could explain better why this is not at all fair. Either way, you got a last minute booking with the lowest price for this month. It is important for this community - especially being a host yourself - to know how to communicate and inform yourself. All the best. Ruud & Diogo Hi Marci, Thanks for your review. We are happy that you enjoyed staying with us. Best Regards, Ruud & Diogo Hi Katelyn, Thanks for your review. We are happy that you enjoyed staying with us. <br/>The studio is small, however, pretty cozy. Amsterdam is known by that. The advertisement says exactly what you reference, so hopefully, you were already aware of it!  Best Regards, Ruud & Diogo Muchas gracias Nathalia. <br/>Ruud & Diogo Muchas gracias Concha. <br/>Ruud & Diogo Hi Adam, we‚Äôre absolutely grateful reading your review. Thank you so much for letting us make you feel welcome in Amsterdam. This is why we love doing what we do.

I am really grateful you took the time to write it. It is a pleasure to us to make your trip last as long as possible. Related to space, it is descript and for the ones that did not read it - we always sent a message about it - so there is no confusion about it. Overall we could not do better related to that.

Hopefully, you had a great time and we are looking forward to welcoming you again. Best Regards,  Dear Peter, thanks for all your comments. It is indeed a beautiful and quiet neighborhood. Flights of stairs! Yes. Excellent workouts and a lot of fun! We do need to see it in a positive way. And the way down is fun! :) No joke, however, stairs are everywhere in Amsterdam in this way. I wish we could change them.  Dear Nicholas, it was a pleasure to have you around guys. We appreciate your care. Looking forward to welcoming you in Amsterdam next time.

See you in Amsterdam! Ruud & Diogo Hey Eric, Thanks for all your comments. We greatly appreciate them and your honest and complete review about the space and us. I have to say that the advertisement says all you reference on the minus side. About the stairs, they are typical overall Amsterdam, so it is a generic issue. I am sure you still had a great time (we did speak about it) and hoped to see you next time you visit Amsterdam. <br/>Best Regards, <br/>Ruud & Diogo  Dear Lindsey, I am euphoric to read all your positive point about our efforts. We do try to make this a special place, where we can make your stay not only more enjoyable but memorable! That what we strive all days. We also appreciate that you recommend us.

De Pijp is indeed a fantastic and popular neighbourhood (still a lot to discover). Next time you are around just let us know. It will be a pleasure to receive you again! Best Regards, Ruud & Diogo  Excusen f√ºr dieses Google-√úbersetzung:<br/><br/>Liebe Elke, vielen Dank f√ºr Ihre Feedback. Es ist wahr, dass das Zimmer f√ºr 4 Erwachsene wirklich klein ist. Deshalb habe ich auch davor warnen, diese in der Anzeige. Es ist ratsam, immer sorgf√§ltig dies lesen, bevor Sie ein Zimmer buchen.<br/>Nur h√∂rte ich auch das Lachen von Sie, so Sie haben auch viel Spa√ü gehabt. Vielleicht, weil es so gem√ºtlich eng war zusammen? ;-)<br/><br/>Klarstellung: Es ist in der Raum heizung , aber nicht im Bad.<br/><br/>Private Feedback werde ich laufen, den Raum zu verbessern. Vielen Dank daf√ºr.<br/><br/>Ich hoffe, dass die √úberraschung mit einer Flasche Champagner und Blumen positiv gewesen sein. Wir haben viel f√ºr diesen zus√§tzlichen Aufwand getan, und es ist darum nicht sch√∂n, nur negatives Feedback zu h√∂ren. Aber das ist nur mein personliche Emotion. Ich m√∂chte sicherstellen, dass meine G√§ste in Ordnung sein un das nehme ich ach Pers√∂nlich weil ich kein Hotel bin. Ich hoffe darum, Sie wieder begr√º√üen zu d√ºrfen. <br/><br/>Mit freundlichen Gr√º√üen Mit,<br/><br/>Ruud Jansma Dear Fabrice, <br/><br/>Thanks to stay with us and for your detailed review! This couple was really kind and polite. Everything went perfect!<br/><br/>Looking forward for your next visit! <br/>Best Regards, <br/> Dear Rene, <br/><br/>Thanks for your review! It was a pleasure to have you around! <br/>Hope to see you on your next visit to Amsterdam. <br/><br/>Best Regards, Dear Eric, <br/><br/>Thanks for your kind review! It was amazing to have you around. <br/><br/>Looking forward to your next visit. <br/><br/>Best Regards, Hi Jessica, <br/><br/>Thanks for your review! It was ""god muy bien"" for us also! <br/><br/>It was a pleasure to meet you guys. <br/>Looking forward to your next visit! <br/><br/>Best Regards, Hi Janina, i'm sorry to read that your stay didn't match your expectations. The pictures on Airbnb are made by a professional photographer. Airbnb arranged this for after a couple of bookings.  I do agree that pictures make the room a little bigger then it is in reality.  This is because the photographer used a wide lens. This is often used for photographing properties. On my Airbnb page you can also read this to warn people. The pictures look better then my own pictures so preferably i don't want to get rid of them. But again i'm sorry that you found the pictures are a bit misleading. I hope this review will give an honest view on the situation. <br/>The room in the shower is temporarily fixed and will be completely renewed in 2 weeks from now.<br/><br/>Thanks for the feedback!  Dear Alena, i'm so sorry to read that your expectations didn't match the level of comfort of the studio. You stayed here for a couple of days and i asked you multiple times if everything was ok for you. your reactions were positive at the time. I therefore think it's a bit dissapointed that you write this overall negative review now. I would have loved to offer you my shower or even my apartment if that was needed.  Hi Ruben, thank you for the honest review. I would like to comment that the first couple of pictures on Airbnb are shot by a professional photographer with a wide angle lens. To avoid misunderstanding i put a comment under the photos: 'Professional photo taken with a wide lens'. When you look at all the pictures you can see that there are also pictures without the wide angle lens. So can see the difference. I did this to give people a fair impression of the room. Unfortunately you had a different thought of what to expect.<br/><br/>About the stairs...well, that's Amsterdam. I didn't knew you would bring some rockband cases with you for the gig you played in cafe Cox. ;-)<br/><br/>I hope you enjoyed your stay in spite of some critical notes and when i travel to Norway, i will let you know.  Thanl you for the review Meg. The problem of the mice is solved. I found a little hole in the floor/ wall behind the kitchenette where he could enter the room. The hole is filled up with iron brush now and they hate that. Besides this I stictly recommend every guest to not put food in the room. This is where the problem starts. There is a fridge outside the room and a microwave in the room where you can leave your food. No mice are detected since then. I also work with a professional cleaner who cleans the room every time there is a check-in. Mice are active in the Amsterdam houses during winter time, not or much less during spring/ summertime. You are more than welcome to stay here again and i will make sure you will forget the mice adventure. ;-)<br/>Best wishes,<br/>Ruud Hi William, I was already afraid for this review. :-( This was not my best Airbnb weekend. The wifi is reinstalled now but of course this is to late for you guys. the sad thing was that i got sick (stomach flu) so i was in my bed the whole weekend. I'm sorry for all the inconveniences. If you want to have a refund on your booking of 25% that 's ok with me.  Hi Thomas, thank you for the good review. Only one thing is not clear for me. The reservation was made for four persons and that's the maximum of people i normally accept. I didn't knew you were with five.  I can't find any information about five people in the email history as well. No hard feelings, but did i miss something?<br/><br/>Thank you for the reply"
12788265,Thank you Eva! I would love to welcome you again; was great having you. All the best! Hi Clara! Thank you so much for your kind words; I feel the same way about the two of you! Hope you had a good time and I wish you all the best.

Thanks for the feedback, I will make sure that the appartmeng will be cleaned propper before someone checks in! Best, marcel "
12953966,"Hi Peter,<br/>Thank you for your feedback. I am sorry to hear that the check in was not easy for you. My apologies and I will definitely try to prevent that from happening again! You are welcome anytime Thank you Frankie for your nice review.<br/><br/>It was a pity than when you where staying in the studio the whole aria had troubles with the television reception due to a local problem with the glass fiber!<br/>The heating is connected with or one system.<br/>As soon as you told me you where cold, we turned it up!<br/><br/><br/>Hope to see you again,<br/><br/>Truus<br/> Thank you Vanessa!<br/>You and your girlfriend are realy nice people, and always welcome!<br/><br/>See you in Amsterdam,<br/><br/>Truus Thank you Nina for your great review!<br/>All the best for you and your mother. Dank je wel Myrthe, voor je prachtige recentie! Dear Alexander,<br/>Thank you for your review!<br/>I have great respect for you and your wife, 80 and 76 years old and still traveling to Europe and visiting big city‚Äôs!  You  both are, warm and friendly people!<br/>The small walk (5 minutes) to the public transport and shops, was a challenge for you, but at the end you appreciated your morning walk! <br/>Have a save trip home!<br/><br/>Truus<br/> Thank you Annette for your nice words!"
12978317,"For us 3 minutes by metro from our lively neighboorhood De Pijp directly to Rokin/Dam square does feel very close to the heart of the city centre! Especially with the entrance of the metro station literally 40 steps from our front door! By bike it‚Äôs only 10 minutes of cycling. By tram  about 7 minutes to the very centre. Glad you liked it! About the cat: our ad does explicitly mention that ""we invite guests who love to take care and caress our red cat Max, that will also be staying in (mainly around) the house"", but we hope it didn't bother you too much and you'r not allergic?"
12978768,"Selin your words touched our hard and your person added positive vibes to our lives. We were very lucky to hostage you. All the best in your life. Hugs and kisses from us Thank you Juliana!    <br/>It was a pleasure to receive you. Luke was a great guest all went perfect Ren√© was a great guest always welcome back Thank you Natalie! It was a pleasure to receive you. Have a good continuation! Thank you Jessica, It was a pleasure to receive you! Hope to visit one day New Zealand Thank you. Thank you Bess! Thank you Marko. It was a pleasure to have you as a guest. Thank you Victor, Nice to have you as a guest! Thank you Martin!  It was a pleasure to have you as guest! Thank you for your review. <br/><br/>You are the first guest to complain about the noise or sounds.                                                                                                      <br/>You have to consider that you are living in an apartment with the hosts and not in lonely planet house or hotel somewhere on the edge of the world . By the way it makes a difference if you have loud chat conversations in the middle of the night when other people are normaly sleeping.   So far most of our guests  have no problem with working, study, or resting during the day in the room.  <br/>The stairs are part from the typical Amsterdam architecture and keeps you fit.<br/>Discription of the room you can find in the general information before booking. Thank you Pavel for your warm comment.<br/>It was a pleasure to meet and have you as a guest!<br/>Always welcome! Dear Emily Amsterdam is an old city and the buildings very often don't have a lift. We mention on the airbnb page that we have stairs! We always help our guest to come up and down with they're suitcases. Unfortunately you din't wait for one of us to come down. We asked you every morning if you sleep well and if you need some thing. Your answer was "" it is all perfect"" . If you have sad that it was too warm we have a couple of fans available. We are not used to receive a rewiuw like yours so we are quite surprised. Maybe in your next experience be more open and talk immideatly to the host so that they can solve your necessities when you are still at the place and not afterwords when there is not a solution anymore. Have a nice continuation of you travel. Dear Min you have to consider that when you stay at airbnb, you are leaving with the day by day reality of the citizens. You are in Holiday and in your case you fell like sleeping very long, this is ok for us but you have to understand that you are not in a hotel. We respect the privacy of our guests a lot but I'm sorry for you that your day schedule was so different then ours. Next time consider to stay at an hotel then you will avoid this situation. We wish you a very good life! Thank you Cebuan. It was also a pleasure  have you in our apartment.<br/>Wish you all the best and a good continuation in Amsterdam. Thank you! <br/>It was a pleasure to host you and to be our guest.<br/>Have a save journey! Clair Just clarifying your comments the 3-story walk up is something very normal in Amsterdam. Amsterdam is a very old city and here 90% of the houses has stairs! When we receive a request from  a aged guest we always mentioned it and give them the choice. In your case it not seamed to be important to do so and we even helped you to come up the stairs like we do with ALL our guest that has a big case! About the loft bed it stays very clear in the photos on the room on Airbnb page it was never a surprise for any guest they even comment like: It looks exactly like on the pictures. Have a good staying in your next Airbnb choices. Kindest regards Frederico was a lovely guest always welcome back in our home! Thank you Hans we are very happy that you enjoy your staying with us. It was a pleasure to have you as a guest. Have a wonderful day  Just clarifying your observations. The couple that was there at the same time as you were not guests but family and they tried to respect you as much as possible. Your times were very unusual for a tourist guest, you stayed almost of the time in the room, sleeping the hole day and in this way is almost impossible to keep a house in silence 24 hours, if you wanted that you didn't make a good choice to use Airbnb. About the bathroom it stays very clear on Airbnb page of this room that is CHAIRED and NOT private, so this should never be a surprise for any of our guests and we have never had problems about it. I hope that in this way your critics are explained. Unfortunately this guest didn‚Äôt understand the roles and the policy of our house.<br/>After 3 years doing airbnb, we are considered a 5 stars host, so this means we can‚Äôt take serious the review of this person.<br/> Thank you so much Seva for your kind words!<br/>And it was a pleasure to receive you. Allways welcome."
12979324,"Hi Lisa, it‚Äôs unfortunate you felt you didn‚Äôt get the experience you expected. We do have an oven (it‚Äôs a microwave and oven in one), the doorbell does work. We provided you with a full guide of the house which explains about the oven etc.  Indeed the ignitor needs fixing but other than that it works fine (manually). It‚Äôs good however to read you had an overal good stay. Thanks!"

Ik heb je verteld dat je me altijd kunt bereiken voor onduidelijkheden, urgente dingen en uitleg.<br/>Helaas heb je dat niet gedaan zodat ik je ook niet heb kunnen helpen met je probleem.<br/>hopelijk heb je wel een leuke tijd gehad. Thank you Amanda for your sweet words!<br/>Love to have you back anytime! Hi Alicia,<br/>Het is heel jammer dat je niets hebt laten weten over je probleem met de afvalbak en de douche. We hadden het meteen kunnen oplossen.<br/>Zoals gezegd, de studio is iets onder straatniveau dus heel soms is er een kleine overloop maar dit is snel te verhelpen!<br/>Hartelijke groet<br/>Pepi Dear Federico,<br/>As I wrote in my review about you,  I thought you were happy and content with everything, because I did not hear from you once!<br/>you had my direct number and could also use the airbnb app to communicate. I always react within 30 minutes with my staying guests!<br/>I could have explained to  you to use the airco for getting fresh air in at night, it has a function of cooling but also getting fresh air in.  I also could have told you; in holland we don't have bidets in the toilet and we like to have separate toilets apart from the bathroom. The bathroom has a big shower and big washbasin.<br/>Idon't understand with your feedback at all, you never contacted me...!? I had no chance to solve your problem or explain the airco.<br/>If you are not happy or have anything to complain about, please let your host know! Thank you so much Carlos for this fantastic review!<br/>Loved to have you stay at our place.<br/>Till next,<br/>Pepi"
13177378,"Hi Kathryn,<br/>thanks a lot for taking your time to write your feedback and your review. It is great to hear that you liked it so much. We are sorry that the apartment was not perfectly clean, that is not our regular standard and it is too bad that it was not at your arrival. We are working a lot on the quality of our cleaning and this feedback helps a lot. Take care and hopefully we can welcome you again! Hi Albert,<br/>thanks for your kind words!<br/>We would love to welcome you back to Amsterdam one day!"

13213532,"thanks Peter, for your positive feedback, glad you have had such positive experience - it was a pleasure to host you! Dear Sudeep,<br/>Thank you for your constructive feedback on my apartment.  <br/>I acknowledge that the WiFi connection in certain corners of the apartment is not optimal, we are sorry that you were inconvenienced by this during your stay. <br/>However, we have been able to objectively measure the WiFi connection as functioning well in the other parts of the apartment. Nevertheless, I think it is valuable to solve your specific experiences for future users. Therefore, we have purchased an additional access point for the flat that serves all corners optimally. Unfortunately, this extra access point was not up and running during your stay. This is now the case.    <br/>Regarding your comment about the heating, I saw after your departure that you had activated the heating on my instructions (plug). This keeps the heating at a basic level. But the thermostat buttons of the individual radiators were still closed. If the radiators are all open, the heating is often too powerful for the flat, especially during this period.<br/>Thanks again. <br/>Hope to see you again. Frans Dear Rachel, thanks for your feedback. It would have been so much easier if you had raised your questions during your stay; of course there IS light in the hallway and on the staircase.  if a reset of the WiFi was needed.  And the front door is a 17th century door - indeed heavy, so that's why we show you how best to hold it, without bringing you troubles... etc.  We are available and happy to answer your questions. Thank you, next time let us have a drink! Hi Anders, thank you for your review. The tap in the bathroom has been changed by now. Sorry for the fact that the leak appaered during your stay and during my absence, so I could not take immediate action. Thanks Charleen, for your positive feedback and I am glad you have liked your stay in my apartment. As you have noticed the house is located in the very city centre of Amsterdam, with all its benefits but unfortunately also a down side... the city sounds during the weekend. Hi July, yes was a pitty we did not meet, but Leon and Frans certainly were excellent substitutes!"
13288851,"We are glad you had a good time and that you enjoyed your stay in our home. You are welcome anytime :-) Thank you for your wonderful review. I'm glad you liked our home. Yep, Bart is 2 meters tall, so the kitchen sink and one bathroom sink are a bit higher then usual üòÄ And our bed is long and wide to fit all the long arms and legs. I could definitely put this 'good for tall people also' in our add üòÅ. Thanks Jane, for the great review! (We forgot to pull the timeswitch from the wifi.

13538315,Always welcome to come back. Thanks for staying in our apartment.
13572361,"Dear Ian, I am sorry our host didn't have time to give you a well-deserved tour 'round the house. It was totally our fault: he expected you wrongly to arrive an hour earlier. If I would have known at the time, I definitely would have called you, and talked you through the house by phone: you are right to expect a thing like that, at least: that is what I think is the extra Airbnb should provide above a hotel. I can't redo this, but I will definitely pay extra attention next time! Luckily you still had a good time, as I understood from your texts and the message you left in the guestbook! Dear Hoang Anh, Thank you for your warm review, we'll be happy to host you again some time! All best, Inger Dear Wolfgang, thanks for the compliments! I am glad you had a great visit!  Dear Arnaud et Coralie, Thank you for your kind words and comment on the oven. It seems to be a problem, as you can see in the comment below! Our oven is 14 years old and heavy used, so we clean it properly before every visit. Unfortunately there are some leaks in the glass door of the oven, due to the age of the oven, so the cleaning liquid is seen on the glass. You could have used it, because it will not affect your food. We understand the complaint, and will replace the oven in time! Thank you Amin for your stay, we're glad you liked the house. Sorry about the oven, it was clean when we left on holidays, I'll speak to the cleaners. Dishwashertablets were in the closet, but it's not always easy to find your way around in someone else's home. We enjoyed having you! Inger and Gijs Dear Steffi, Thank you very much for your warm words, it ws great having you over! PLease feel welcome any time! Dear Irina, You make us blush! We are very happy you had such a great stay! Welcome back!"

A pity that your train was delayed and then you wanted to check in at the time when I had a bereavement client and therefore you had to check in later. Sorry to hear you experienced it as 'nervig'. Hi Claire, thanks for your feedback. It is never ok that you had an experience of being stolen from, so I do understand your concern regarding the security measures.

14071035,"Thank you for your wonderful compliments. The curtains in the bedrooms are not room darkening. That's right, however, behind the curtains there are roller blinds that blackout and protect against the sun. Have a look and let it go. You can use the spirals from the net curtains to get them tight against the windows. Do you like to walk along the canals. You reach them within five minutes of my apartment. Amsterdam is great to experience by bike."

Regularly I do tell about other B&B guests staying in the appartment. I regret not telling you when you arrived.   Thank you Stefano! I will work with the professional photographer from Airbnb (free of charge service of Airbnb for hosts).

14187610,"Dear Cesar,<br/>I am very sorry to hear about the cigarette smell. This normally doesn't happen since it is not allowed to smoke in the room. Sadly the guests that stayed before you chose to ignore the rules and smoke in the room. <br/>I didn't know until it was to late, so there was nothing I could do last minute, because it obviously takes some time for the smell to disappear.<br/>Again my apologies and hope you had a great stay despite of this. I am sorry to hear you were disappointed about the separate toilet. <br/>But to be honest.. It is mentioned on the page so you could have know before booking the room. I hope you had a great stay regardless! :) Thank you for your feedback! The isolation of the door will be fixed as soon as possible! Dear Baptiste,<br/>I am sorry to hear you were disappointed with the fact that there was no bath in the bathroom, but it is not true that it is mentioned there is bath on the listing you booked.<br/>I have two listings available and the other one has a bath. So you probably mistaken one booking for the other one.<br/>I hope you have had a pleasant stay nonetheless! :)<br/>Best wishes,<br/>Yvo I am sorry you felt this way. First time somebody complained about the size and  I have 2 people staying in the same room 95% of the time. I am a bit surprised about the comment regarding the luggage, because I helpt you carry it up to the apartment. I hope you still enjoyed your stay in Amsterdam and enjoy the rest of your trip! :) I respect your opinion, but I have to say I am very surprised you found it that noisey.<br/>Out of all the guests I have had (80+) you are the first ones to complain about this and I actually had a lot of comments about how quiet it is even though it is in the middle of the centre.

14620877,"Since not all people speak Dutch, hereby a translation of the review:<br/><br/>TThe apartment is well suited for a visit to Amsterdam. During the day we walked in the buzz of the city and in the evening we could chill and relax in a nice and spacious apartment, with all the comfort. Emiel made sure that we had all info and helped us upon arriving. The neighbourhood is really nice, you can go to a bakery in the morning and go out for a drink or a bite in the evening. Everything is really nearby, with the tram and the bus in front of the door. The Park & Ride (Zeeburg) is 10 minutes away by bus, really convenient and cheap: we paid 3 euros for 3 days of parking. There is no noise in the night. We had a perfect stay. Thank you Emiel and Nina! Since we don't all speak French, hereby a translation using translate:<br/><br/>Contact with our host was very easy because he speaks English. Response times were adequate, he explained everything well and once arrived on site, the apartment was much like the pictures, very nice and spacious. We had no real problems to live in this modern apartment. The neighborhood is not the most beautiful of Amsterdam, but it is close to many shops and transport to get to the central station where start all the essential activities of the city."
14626041,"Sorry about the heating I had no idea it was a problem. The details of how to turn up the radiators is in the room with the other quick to hand information. I am sorry you found this the case. Our place is set up for a typical  long weekend stay for people seeing the city ( ie not working)   and for most people this appears to be OK. .I agree it is not ideal if you are working. However  I note you made use of the garden table as a desk inside and although our space is small you appeared to rearrange things depite the limited space.  I also note you returned everything back and left everything in good order which I appreciate very much. I would love to incorporate a work table inside but with limited space it would be at the expense of something else.  I suggest next time you book a bnb that specifically caters for a work situation. However thank you for your remarks and I will see if I can search for a solution that could make it better for various different senareos. Sorry to hear about the problem with the pillows . Would have been more than happy to give you a different kind if you had let us know at the time. Glad it didn't appear to mess up your stay too much. All the best. Dear Natalia,<br/>I am sorry to hear about your reaction to the rug. I wish you had mentioned it at the time I would have happily removed it for the duration of your stay. Noone has ever had this problem before, as you can see from previous reviews. In  fact many people comment on how clean the suite is and I can assure you I vacum the rug and the whole suite for each change over of guest. <br/><br/>However of course this does not diminish your discomfort during your stay and I only wish you had allowed me to try and find a solution during your visit.<br/><br/>Best wishes<br/><br/>Jo Dear Dan, Thanks for lovely review it was lovely to host you. Just to avoid confusion for future guests we don't have a bath but I assume you meant bathroom! Thanks and best wishes. Jo Oo I'm blushing! Thank you! Thank you for your lovely review... a great way for us to begin 2015! Best wishes for the New Year. Jo Dear Anna, Thank you for a,lovely review. you are our last guests of 2014 and you rounded off a lovely year of fantastic vistors. It was a pleasure to meet you and hope we see you back in Amsterdam again sometime. Jo Glad you had such a good time and thanks for the tips about the bestek ( providing some cutlery)  etc we shall certainly do that! Best wishes  Juan, Thanks for lovely review would be lovely to see you again. Best wishes Jo Dear Todd, Thank you for the lovely review. I hope it isn't too long before you get a chance to have a well earned rest and visit Europe again! Best wishes Jo Thanks for the lovely review! It was a pleasure to host you. Thanks for the lovely review! Thanks for your positive review I hope you had a good time in Paris."

Hi Jan, I have just returned form my trip to Scandinavia and feel sorry that your experience with the agency that took care of my home while I was gone has been negative concerning arrival, cleaning and the extra charge for your late arrival (something I never do myself). Nonetheless I hope you had a nice stay in Amsterdam and wish I could have avoided this inconvenience if I had been there ...  Hi L√©o, I have just returned form my trip to Scandinavia.

14785872,"Thank you Chris. You have been a great quest and welcome back anytime. Have a safe trip home Sorry to hear about wifi. Normally works fine. Next time let me know. A simple restart of router would probably solved issue. Have a good trip home! Welcome back anytime! Have a safe trip back home Thank you Lou. Hope to welcome you back in the near future Thank you. Welcome back anytime! And the cat loved you guys ;) Thanks for taking good care of Doutze and our house. Hope to meet again. Best Tanja & Martijn Thank you Mark. Was pleaser having you guys. Hope to see you again! And you are welcome back anytime Marcel. Thanks for taking good care of everything. Bes thank you very much Kenneth. You have been rgeat guests. Hope to see you and your family with the marathon next year ;) I think my review and feedback I wrote say it all:<br/>Really sorry this happened. And even worse have not heared back fro you at all!!<br/>Sometimes you have to go with your first thought. And that was NOT accepting booking from Branco. We have a nice family house in the center of Amsterdam which we sometimes rent out via AirBnB. We mainly accept family bookings because our home is decorated as that. We have 2 children a cat and a big garden. Great for families. Having read some not so good reviews from Branco and having seen the group setting, I emailed that we did not agree. This was not a house for them. He told me he would really like to stay in our home and would really look after it well and respect the house. I doubted but accepted because I trusted him. Stupid from me!!! The stay was a disaster. There was bad communication with Branco. He was blurry and absent in his communication. Upon check-in I gave a tour and explained everything. It was agreed that check out would be at 11.00. On the check-out day it started with a txt message asking for later check out. When arriving at house I saw at downstair floor there where wet towels on wooden floor. The explained it by saying they where cleaning the floor. But soon I found out that they had flooded the shower in the bathroom. Water came so high so high that it came out on wooden floor in hall from the bathroom. The reason was they did not clean the sink‚Ä¶.When I confronted one of the guest, Branco was gone‚Ä¶,he said he saw it happening but he wanted a shower. Not calling me, not taking bath instead of shower, no on purpose destroying the house. I also saw that there were additional people that stayed. They had slept on a couch upstairs. When I confronted the other guests with the things that happened nobody knew about anything. Branco had not tolled them or showed them our rules and use of our house. Would NEVER trust these guys and NEVER allow NOW more in my house. Of course, this has also been brought to AirBnB and is still awaiting reply. Great pity because only so far had beautiful experiences ..."
14800933,"Thanks for your review Emily. Unfortunately a stove is no longer allowed in BnBs in Amsterdam by regulations of the municipality. Thank you for your feedback Kacey. I think we have a slight misunderstanding about the fully independent situation of the studio. It has it‚Äôs own entrance which is accessible for guests round the clock. Moreover bathroom and kitchenette are for guests only. As you rightly state, you will hear sounds from other people in a shared apartment building. Since the studio is part of our living space there is an interior door which is locked throughout the your whole stay. Hi Tracy, sorry to hear that the lighting was too dim. There is a dimmer to adjust the level to your likings. Dear Larry,<br/>I am so sorry to hear about the noise outside the building. I did sent you a message the night before though, both via the AirBnB system and via sms. From your review it seems you haven't received none of them which is a pity. Thanks so much for your compliments Madeline. It‚Äôs much appreciated and a stimulant for hosting future guests. Thank you Sammie! Love to hear you appreciated your stay with us. Dear Nabil, again my apologies for the malfunctioning coffee maker during your stay. It is back in order again, although I realise this will not make it up for you. <br/><br/>Yours Kenneth"

Thanks so much Meredith for your review! :-) it was a pleasure having you over as a guest! Please come back one day to Amsterdam! "
14856684,"The food scraps in a small kitchen bin: that was a mistake (never made before, due to the fact that we were absent when the guests arrived, which normally is not the case).<br/>The spill over of the water in the shower is a consequence of a very slow change in the building itself, which cannot be repaired. That's why we provide swiper, as is clearly explained in our notes for guests. Every guest so far has taken note of that particular instruction. <br/>The second bed is two meters long and has a normal width for one adult. It's placed in a child room, with a piano and toys - that why many people like it.<br/>About the (big) towels we have never received any complaints whatsoever. We always wash them after use of the guests<br/>People of the fire brigade once visited our home, for an advice, and had no comments on the wiring.<br/>And the notes for guests explain all kinds of things about the apartment, and it certainly does not say to vacuum or clean the apartment - furthermore, we do not charge extra cleaning costs."

15507949,"Sadly, you havent read the description where explain in detail that the room is open during the day. <br/>So that negative comment is unfair. If you wouldve liked a fully private room you shouldnt have chosen a room that is clearly listed as 'shared'.<br/>Reviews like these are horrible. I will see if airbnb will allow this to stay up.<br/>Im sad to read you didnt appreciate my hospitality. Kind words and yet I receive a 4 star review . Thats never a nice experience. Teo has the audacity to give me 4 stars after lying to me and not informing me about a new person coming instead of him! It was a stressful amd awkward situation and highly disrespectful. Sadly I was too late to write a review myself, I would have given a low rating for the lack of respect and appreciation of my hospitality. This is my home and not a hostel.  Guests like you are the worst to deal with and make me feel awful . Fortunately his friends were kind. I do everything in my power to make everyone happy. So Im saddened to see this review after treating me like that. When it comes to price-quality bear in mind airbnb takes almost 1/3 of the price. For anyone who reads this: dont be like Teo! Entitled people are not welcome :( Aw thanks for the amazing review Alexandra youre making my day üíïYoure the sweetest! It was a pleasure to have you over :) So sweet of you :) thanks Aleksandar! was a pleasure to host you really . Wishing you all the best Oh you gave me a 4 :( that makes me sad. Ignore my positive personal message, thanks Thank you Imogen üíï was a pleasure to host you! Verblijven op n toplactie tegen een superlage Budgetprijs en een plek met katten, en dan durven klagen om haren. Vind ik niet netjes. <br/>Bevoorrechte gasten zoals jij mogen wegblijven, word hier werkelijk doodongelukkig van. The review is in a language I cannot read. <br/>I found her attitude shockingly entitled and unpleasant during her live-in stay.<br/>The whole experience showed a level of disrespect towards my hospitality as a host as I put more time in accommodating all her extra wishes then usually necessary , yet this is her rating.<br/>When staying at someone‚Äôs home be kind and dont touch their personal belongings without asking, respect the houserules.<br/>To Wuju, take your entitlement and selfishness somewhere else it truly doesnt belong in the airbnb community.<br/>This was a horrible and intensely draining experience for me to host her.<br/>Luckily 99% of guest are amazing people so this was a rare experience.<br/>To anyone who reads this ..don‚Äôt be like Wuju!<br/>Be humble and kind instead , hosts are humans too , who want to offer a great experience :) The kitchen is NOT advertised as a space for guests for a reason. Assuming you can use it was quite disrespectful . It should have been requested beforehand if it was unclear. Check the listings profile better and leave the entitlement at home. I wish I did not have to deal with the discomfort this gave me. Reading this review is very disappointing :(  I tried to give you a nice experience eventhough its outside of the scope of what I advertise. Check for hotels with kitchen use next time or respect the fact that youre staying in someone‚Äôs home not a budget hostel. Thanks for the review. Unfortunately for me , I did not feel as comfortable as I usually am with other guests :/ It seemed he had not read the clear description of the room beforehand. And misunderstood my explanation of the very simple houserules by closing the room on his own accord. He did apologise but something just felt off for me afterwards.I believe for some a hotelroom might be a better option if respecting houserules is difficult. <br/>I tried to offer the best experience nonetheless and hope he enjoyed his stay and beautiful Amsterdam. Sadly for me, this was a mismatch of expectations. Thanks so much Juliette for your wonderful review :) Was lovely meeting you and your friends! A la procha√¨ne.."
15510514,"Excuse me Myles, what ever do you meen ? Did you have a good time ?"
15573548,"I‚Äôm really sorry to hear my apartment didn‚Äôt meet Jack‚Äôs expectations. I have never had any negative reviews before, so I wasn‚Äôt aware that anything needed changing. Nevertheless I have added:<br/><br/>- an extra duvet/blanket<br/>- extra pillows<br/>- extra big towels<br/>- a kettle + toaster<br/>- an oven (was already present: it‚Äôs a oven/microwave combination)<br/>- a reading lamp<br/>- a welcome note explaining how everything works"
15712909,"Hi Rebecca,<br/>It‚Äôs too bad I didn‚Äôt get the chance to talk to you about your concerns. Perhaps your expectations about Airbnb might have been better explained in person.<br/>Although it‚Äôs called Airbnb. There is no mandatory rule which states there should be breakfast. Airbnb is a platform for people to host guest all over the world. Inside the listing you book all included amenities and features are listed. Including the inclusion or exclusion of breakfast. Although I understand the confusion, Airbnb‚Äôs generally don‚Äôt offer included breakfast as that‚Äôs very hard to manage for people who also have a full time job on the side.<br/>Your other concern regarding cleaning. I have one of the lowest cleaning cost prices on the entire platform. And my only check-out instructions are basic things like throwing your trash in the container which in my personal opinion is something very natural to expect when having guest stay somewhere. Airbnb by all means is not a hotel. It‚Äôs a place were people live and personally work hard to offer a pleasant stay for their guest. However, my check-out process is one of the fairest and easiest. Perhaps your assumptions about Airbnb as a platform were a little bit misplaced however I am very happy I was able to give you an enjoyable experience. I would still love to invite you again in the future. You and your friend were lovely guest. Hi Leon,<br/>There are curtains in the room which you can close and they do the job really well. I presume you were trying to sleep at daytime or didn‚Äôt close them because it get‚Äôs quite dark with the curtains closer. I however don‚Äôt know how dark you are used to yourself, but I can asure you, the curtains do the job. Hi Emmanual,<br/>I am sorry you didn‚Äôt find the apartment clean during your stay. I always try to clean everything twice a week and especially the rooms before guests arrive. However this was also during my own holiday and I just cleaned the house once before you guys came in and left the responsibilities to a third party while I was away. I am quite sorry if you experienced any inconvenience because of it however am glad the area and your time in Amsterdam was enjoyable! Thank you very much Yevheniia! Was great hosting you. Feel welcome to stay anytime again in the future :) Hi Xavi, Thank you for your nice comments! I had to google translate haha. You are always welcome to stay again :) Hi Michelle,<br/>Your room, the bathroom and Kitchen were very clean. I am quite surprised I didn‚Äôt hear any complaints during your stay. I was very welcoming to you at all times.<br/>My apartment is only a 10 min walk from the ferry which is very close to everything. The bus stop is only 20 seconds from my house door! and is also just a 10 min trip to the city center which is available 24/7.<br/>Please send a fair review next time. I didn‚Äôt get complaints like this before.<br/>I hope the stay was worth your experience thank you for having stayed with me.<br/>Nima Michelle feel welcome to stay anytime again! Thank you Oskar! :) Thank you Noah! :) Thank you Pierre :) Hi Anne,<br/><br/>Thank you for your feedback. During the entirety of the booking (before arrival, during your stay and after you've left) I kept contact and tried my best giving you a warm and comfortable stay. Unfortunately I was hospitalized the day of your arrival and left my key for you so I couldn't welcome you personally but you could get in the house! The room was actually cleaned twice. It was cleaned the week before when the last guests left the room. And the day before your arrival I cleaned the room again, making sure there was no dust or anything.<br/><br/>The next day I left the hospital early and cleaned the whole house again including the Toilet and Bathroom and left a kind note with extra towels to thank you for your feedback because I really wanted you to feel welcome in my house. I actually wanted to give you a gift as appreciation but didn't get the chance to give it to you personally.<br/><br/>The house was very clean, your room was clean as well. When I asked what seemed to be the problem I only got 1 message which was that you were disappointed. And I can read in this review that the underlying problem seems to be the price. I am truly sorry you feel that way, but the room was exactly like in the pictures and is big as well. I don't understand why you were so disappointed and I tried communicating but you didn't reply.<br/><br/>I would have gladly talked with you and find a solution. I'm a very kind host and your feedback means a lot to me. I'm sorry you didn't have anything other than a perfect experience. I hope we can still message so we can adress what seemed to be the problem. Thank you Anne. Your host Nima Hi Jacqualine, Thank you for your feedback and kind words. I am glad you enjoyed your stay! You are welcome to stay anytime again! Thank you for the kind words. It was lovely being able to host you :) I'm glad you enjoyed your stay and time in Amsterdam! Thank you Kailin :) You were very friendly too. Take care! Thank you for your feedback Julia! It was great hosting you. Feel welcome to stay anytime again :) Thank you for the feedback :) I hope to welcome you again in the future! Thank you Hristo! Was great hosting you! Thank you Victor for your kind words! Feel welcome to stay anytime again :) You are very welcome! Thank you for the kind words Thalita! Dear Louisa,<br/><br/>Out of the 125 guest who's stayed here before 70 left a review giving me the nicest comments they could give all recommending my place. Even the latest 2 reviews which are from guests who stayed exactly the same dates as you. I'm terribly sorry you've had a bad experience, but not only was it NYE which is a day everyone is allowed to celebrate. It was also a night were people come home late. I'm terribly sorry somebody ringed the door bell in the morning that was totally out of my control. But I don't think you are leaving a fair review since things didn't happen exactly the way you are saying.<br/><br/>You made pictures of my friends and me at 10 AM while they were eating breakfast in the kitchen to send to Airbnb as ""proof"" we were being loud? Just to get your money back. That's theft in my opinion. You've had a gorgeous room in a gorgeous house and neighbourhood for the lowest price you could find in Amsterdam during NYE while my apartment is very close to the city center. You even told one of my friends she looked good and you wanted to make a picture of her. Are you kidding me? Don't mess with privacy. That's the most important aspect of Airbnb and having people sleep. I take those things seriously! And the fact we had a falling out doesn't make this a bad place to stay. I'm sorry you've decided to cancel as your way, but atleast make a fair review.<br/><br/>The bathroom was clean, somebody just showered before you did. The toilet started leaking 1 day before NYE I called a plumber service but as you might expect. They don't work during NYnight&day so I had to wait 2 days which I never got the chance to explain you since you decided to attack my friends privacy. I cleaned the toilet 6 times during those 2 days and still you tell me I didn't care? Also it's strange you call me reckless while you decided to shout to me in the house. I just decided not to respond right away and wait till you cool off but when I knocked on your door to talk you decided to ignore and refused to open and talk for a sollution. 30 min later you started making pictures and cancelled your booking. I'm sorry I did my best. But as a host I take my guests seriously even in a hotel they wouldn't be able to come by your wishes during NYE.<br/><br/>I hope you were able to enjoy your time in Amsterdam regardless. If you would have tried to actually meet me instead of complain right away we would have had a great start and I could explain you everything. I'm a very generous guy and very kind. I even take guests to tour around the city when I get the chance to do so, this is part of my life. Don't tell me I'm a reckless person if you havn't even tried to meet me.<br/><br/>Regards,<br/>Nima Thank you Bill!, I hope you will enjoy all your upcoming journeys. It was a pleasure hosting you and your friend! You're welcome to stay anytime again! Aqaash, your kind words are exactly why I do my job. Thank you very much. It's a privilege to host for you. I hope your experience in Amsterdam and my stay will stay well in your memory!<br/><br/>Thanks a lot! Thank you very much for your kind words Shoraya! I hope I helped making your holiday a better experience :) Feel free to stay anytime again! It was no problem at all. Easy fix for me and it could happen to anyone. Thank You for your kind words! Thank you Paul! Thank you very much Tatiana! It means a lot! Feel welcome to stay anytime again in the future. I am glad you had a lovely time :) Hi Alina,<br/><br/>You are very welcome. I just missed meeting you. I came back from holidays the day after. But I'm glad you enjoyed your stay! You can always stay again in the future :) Hi Angela,<br/><br/>Thank you very much for your kind words. I'm sorry I was not able to meet you two since I was still in HK. But I am very glad you enjoyed the place. Specially for festivals since the NDSM area is pretty much next door. I hope you had a great time at the amazing festivals in Amsterdam and this experience will have left you with great memories. Thank you again Angela! Hi Claire, I am glad you enjoyed your stay and I'm sure my father enjoyed hosting you as well. I wish I was able to meet you too, but was in Hong Kong myself for holidays. For the bathroom I'm sorry if that wasn't clear in the listing, I hope you didn't have a bad experience sharing the bathroom and kitchen with the other guests. We always clean the kitchen and bathroom as well as we can to make you feel comfortable with it. Having private bathrooms for both rooms is a luxury we unfortunately don't have. I appreciate the feedback you're giving me Peter,<br/><br/>But expecting me to offer bikes for free is really not practical since renting bikes is really cheap and bikes get stolen very often and easily in Amsterdam. And it's too bad you felt anything else then perfect because of that subject. It is really something which is out of my hands.<br/><br/>Regarding Kabel TV, for the next time really check the descriptions on Airbnb so you know exactly what to expect.<br/><br/>I am of course glad you did choose to stay with me, the first day I brought you and your wife to the ferry with my car gladly, to show you the way. And I helped you with your planning to places to see like ""Keukenhof"".<br/><br/>But we still share the house so cleanliness comes both ways, leaving your socks, towels and many personal items in the shared bathroom was a bit disturbing for the other people using the bathroom. Please take it as friendly feedback. I still enjoyed the laughs we had and the conversations.<br/><br/>I will take your feedback very seriously! Hi Zelie, thank you for your feedback. I put a lot of effort in cleaning the apartment and also cleaned the apartment multiple times during your stay. However, due to the nature of hosting. In rare cases one of the shared rooms might not have been left in prestine condition by other guests and I might not notice it until I get back home. However, having said that. I still do not believe my apartment was ever unclean during your stay. So it feels like you were perhaps disappointed because the kitchen light broke which was fixed quickly but strongly affected your impression.<br/>I apologize for that. Unfortunately that too is something which is out of my control. If something breaks, I try to fix it quickly.<br/>I‚Äôve been hosting for 10 years and still to this day try hard to keep my guests happy. Cleaning is always my top priority Hi Anita, it is very unfortunate you didn't send me a message about the temperature. My house has central heating. So even if you open the radiator. I need to increase the central heat for it to warm up. In my room it was actually not that cold but perhaps you left a window open too long. Regardless I would have gladly raised the temperature if you messaged me. I did not receive any messages prior. Please next time message your host instead of rating them lower in the review. I would have gladly resolved the issue with you as I always strive to give my guests a 5 star experience. Hi Don,<br/>There‚Äôs actually a lot of food options nearby. There‚Äôs a Chinese restaurant just 2 min walk from my place. The grocery store is about 10 min walk including ‚ÄúNDSM‚Äù which is a hip area with lots of options.<br/>1 day before your arrival day I send very detailed directions on the airbnb app. However because you didn‚Äôt see the passcode I send you earlier either I think you might have missed my messages and instructions.<br/>Please use your smartphone and the airbnb app to find everything I send you. And  also don‚Äôt ignore my questions.  However I think google maps is definitely something I advice my guests to have to be able to get around in areas which they are new in. My house is only 1 min walk from busstop but even without internet you can download an offline map of Amsterdam from home with Google maps!<br/>I am sorry you had some trouble with finding things but google maps would have really helped with most of your issues. I always give tips and directions to anybody who books with me inside the app. Please keep a smartphone and the airbnb app close to you when traveling.<br/>Regards,<br/>Nima Hi Alex,<br/><br/>Thank you for your feedback! :)<br/><br/>Just one question, where did you find the description about 8 people being hosted the same time? I only have 2 guest rooms currently excluding my own room which has it's own shower. So worst case scenario 4 guests can stay in total and I have my own shower on my own floor so sharing shouldn't be that much. I'm very sorry if somebody didn't leave the shower clean before you. Unfortunately I can't find out about every thing happening between me cleanups. But I am glad you had a comfortable stay! Have a good one, and if anytime in the future you need a stay again I hope I can impress you next time! Thank You for your kind words Chantelle! Thank You! Thank you for your kind words! Merci! Thank you Jenni, sorry for taking too long emptying the rubbish bin in the Toilet, I'm going to buy a bigger one thank you for your feedback! I appriciate this a lot :) Thank you for your review Richard! It was great hosting you and would love to host you again in the future! Thank you for your kind words Carson! I appriciate it a lot :) Thank you for your kind words Meredith! Thank you for your feedback Elizaveta :D Hi Cathy, thank you for your feedback! This helps me a lot. And feel free to stay anytime again :) Merci Jerome :) Hi Natalie,<br/><br/>Thank you for your feedback and nice words. Rooms always get cleaned prior to arrival ofcourse :) sheets & towels are provided! You're very welcome Leonardo! I hope you had a great stay and enjoyed your time in Amsterdam. Take care! It was great hosting you Aude! Feel free to stay anytime again :) Good Luck with your Journaling! I'm glad you enjoyed your stay! :) Feel free to stay anytime again! Thank you very much Verena! I am glad you enjoyed your stay! Thanks a lot John! I hope you had an amazing time and stay! That's very kind of you Brian! Thank you for choosing my home and I would welcome you anytime again! You're welcome Martin! And thank you for your kind words. I'm glad you enjoyed your stay! Feel free to stay again anytime. Thank You :) Angelina! Feel welcome to stay anytime again! Thank you Giselle,<br/>You're welcome :) Thank you Elajna!<br/><br/>You are welcome to stay anytime again :) Danke Zita! It was great meeting you and your daughter! Hi Mike!<br/><br/>Thank you very much for your kind words. I didn't want to wake or disturb you since I was home late each time. Wish we had more time to meet. I am glad you enjoyed your stay! In case you ever come to Amsterdam again. You are welcome to stay again! Hi Philipp,<br/><br/>Thank you so much! As an Airbnb host, kind words like this are the most rewarding thing about the job. I am very glad you loved the place always feel welcomed to stay again in one of my listings. I would love to host you again in the future that's a promise! Thank you so much Shrikant for your kind words. I saw the note you left on the fridge. This is exactly why I love doing what I do. I am glad you enjoyed your stay. And feel welcome to stay anytime again! Thanks again Jess, you were a very lovely guest and very friendly. I hope you had a great experience in Amsterdam! Thank you for your kind words Richard, feel free to join again in the future. For people who have early flights there are busses 24/7 going directly from my home to the city and central station :) Ferry is not a must, more like a fun freebie ride! Mohammad asked if he could leave his luggage only HOURS before his check-out time. He had no choice but to leave since I was not available to respond to his message. He should have requested this days before his check-out as I already had no possibility to keep his luggage any longer.<br/>Cleaning cost of 30 euro's is close to nothing. I make cost taking trips to the laundry store which cost me more than 30 euro's each time! But if guests can't throw away their own trash like decent visitors do then I rather have them book a hotel. This is my home, not a hotel. I invite you in my living space and houserules and checkout rules are there so I can live comfortably in my own home. I clean rooms but I am not a trash collector. It's a very simple to follow rule since there are containers outside to throw your trash in. How hard can that possibly be?<br/>Some guests really should understand what Airbnb means. This is not a hotel with maid's or reception. It's my home Please don‚Äôt give this review too much attention. Before booking with me Felipe had issues with his ID verification on Airbnb. Within 20 min I messaged him to support him in getting this fixed. After finishing his booking I yet again gave him a very warm welcome message and asked him to let me know about his check in time. I messaged him a few days before his stay and then I messaged him again 1 dat before his stay to give him an extensive long explanation on directions to my house from the airport or train station. On the check-in day I messaged him in the evening welcoming him in my home and sharing some extra info, handy spots and sharing the house rules.<br/>I then messaged him asking how he is liking his stay. I also messaged him 1 day before leaving about check-out process and yet again asking him if he enjoyed his stay so far.<br/>The absolute only reason Felipe gave me 4 stars and is acting mad is because my provider had maintenance the day before his check-out and he didn‚Äôt have internet for 4 hours. He send me a message about it when I was at work and I got home that night late and then saw the message. I rebooted the router and modem and everything seemed to be fine on my end altho the provider mentioned there was maintenance. The next day however Felipe over stayed for 3 hours. He was supposed to leave at 11AM but was still in the room at 2PM and I didn‚Äôt even mention anything to him as kindness.<br/>Felipe is 1 out of those 1000 guest who as soon as something doesn‚Äôt go their way, they suddenly forget every little thing a host has done for them during the whole process. I usually don‚Äôt respond like this from other reviews you can see but this one was quite unfair after all the time I invested writing him all those messages and hosting him the best way I could.<br/>I unfortunately don‚Äôt have the power to predict calamities with internet maintenance or shutdowns. However, having said that. I am proud to have the fastest internet available in The country. 1000mbit download speed with lowest ping and latency possible.<br/>Thank you for staying with me Felipe. I just wish you would have looked at your messages and responded to mine, but you never did until the wifi didn‚Äôt work. Thank You guys!<br/>Was great hosting you :)<br/>At night there are night buses going directly from CS to my house. Sorry I should have mentioned that maybe. Would love to see you guys again! Thank You :) Dankjewel Ilke, jullie zijn altijd welkom om weer te verblijven! Hi Jakob thank you for your kind words! I'm glad you liked your stay! Hi Victor,<br/><br/>Thank you for your feedback, I don't understand why you never contacted me trough Airbnb I send you messages without getting responses before and during your stay! You didn't tell me your Check-In time so I left your key under the plant even asking you if you found the house and got in. You didn't contact me for questions. You didn't check the house rules which mentioned that I kindly ask everyone to take their own shampoo and shower gel. The ones you saw were either from other guest or my own in the closet.<br/><br/>The ad says I have a TV without Kabel please check the Airbnb ad again! So it's very clear the TV is meant to use if you want to set up your Laptop with HDMI. I left 4 towels 2 big and 2 small. As an host ofcourse I have a life too if you would have communicated with me we could be able to meet. I have a daytime job myself. And as tourists my guest usually are out all day/night I only have a chance to meet before you guys go to bed which is after midnight in most cases or leave off to the city which is before afternoon that's a very small time frame to expect me to meet and greet everyone in the house without ever disturbing them. I get lots of guests and try to meet all of them but not being able to meet you in person does not change the service I give each and everyone. It's very very important for guests to respond to their messages on Airbnb and communicate with the host. Definitelly if there are any problems. I will go an extra mile to reach out and help you out. But if I get ignored I can't do anything. What do you mean by NO SOAP? There's 2 soaps in the Bathroom, the toilet has soap, the kitchen has 3 kinds of soap everywhere! How can you possibly say there's no soap? I appriciate your feedback Victor, I have been hosting for quite some time and always like hearing feedback. But I also expect my guests to follow the house rules and communicate if they need anything. Especially when I communicate with them and ask if they are enjoying their stay. I need to get a response! Thank you Yue for your review. The construction sites only take a few weeks but I understand it can be difficult when you come by car without navigation. I hope you had a pleasant stay :) I was glad to be able to host you! Thank you Mikolaj for your kind words! Feel welcome to stay again in the future! Thank you for your review! :) Hi Gabriel,<br/><br/>Thank you for your nice words and feedback. I appreciate it! I wish you the best and thank you for booking with me. Hi Napina! Thank you for your nice words :) I am glad you enjoyed the stay! Feel free to stay anytime again!<br/><br/>Nima Hi Ruth, Thank you for staying with me. Feel free to book anytime again! Thank you for your kind words Dayna! You and Nicky were amazing guests and you are welcome to stay anytime again! Thank you for the very kind words Gin, it was truly a pleasure hosting you and your wife.<br/><br/>Sorry for leaving cutlery on the sink. The kitchen is shared with other guest. Somebody probably forgot to clean everything. I'm glad you enjoyed your stay! Would love to visit Australia next time! :)<br/><br/>Hope you got home safe and sound! You and your wife are always welcome to stay again!<br/><br/>Thank you sir :) Hunter, thank you for your very kind words. That's exactly why I'm doing this for. I'm glad you and your friend enjoyed your stay and time. Feel free to stay anytime again. And perhaps see you in the future when I start my trip in the states! Take Care! Thank you for your kind words Alex, It's too bad we didn't get the chance to meet in person. Feel free to stay anytime again in the future! Victor it was a great pleassure to host you and your colleagues and I wish to do it again in the future :)<br/><br/>Thank you! You're welcome Elia! Hope to see you guys again in the future :)<br/><br/>Take Care! Rodrigo & Bruna! You guys are amazing. You guys were amazing guests and I am glad I got the chance to meet you two. I will definitely try to come to Brazil or France while you are there to meet again. Cheers to our future journeys! I'm totally sure this is not a farewell but just a good bye for now! :) Have an amazing time in your future journeys guys! I seriously loved having you guys stay here! Thank you very much Sam. You and your girlfriend are definitely welcome to stay anytime again! Thank you for your kind words Daniel. You're welcome to stay anytime again! You're welcome Victor!"

15812999,"Giant thanks for noticing that the sink needed to be unblocked. Plunger on it and it's fixed before the next guest. Greetings from the Jordaan. Hi Beth, Why didn`t you ask how it works,because there is floor heating, infra heating and a blower !  Bur sorry for the inconvenient. Greetings from Ad & Anna.  Dear Madeleine, Sorry we are historians but not psychiatrist. We can offer you a nice place to stay, but not a life. Life is more than a pizza box. Wish you all the best.¬†<br/> Thanks also for your private review.  About the ‚Äú View ‚Äú: Look what you get for your money. Wysiwyg. But in case you want more ‚Äú Amsterdam‚Äù stairs,  more room and more view,  rent our neighbors space but they charge you 2.5 ours!  What do you need by visiting a city!  Regards Ad & Anna  Dear Gauthier, remarkable that you find the studio slightly cold: when we came in the apartment after your leaving the temperature in the studio was 24 degree! The kitchen is the same as the subscription in the advertisement: suitable for lunch and breakfast or a quick dinner. <br/>We had told you in advance that at Saturday evening we celebrated my anniversary with live music till 12. We did invite you to join. You even make the statement to put it in perspective that you are students and know what night live brings ! .  So you could heard our live music, but that is not normal procedure. We hope that, despite the rainy weekend, you still loved Amsterdam.  <br/> Herzliche danke f√ºr die positive Beurteilung. Gru√üe Ad &Anna Thank you for your enthusiastic review. Stil we would like to receive your picture for on the wall;) "
15996910,"It's summer in Amsterdam.<br/>After a long wet gray winter, my neighbors rightly enjoy the long summer evenings. The apartment is located in the most popular neighborhood in Amsterdam center.<br/>This is also clearly detailed in our description of the ad on AirBnB. <br/>Expecting double glazing in a canal house is not very realistic. <br/>The building dates back to the 19th century and is now listed as a monument. Canal houses are old and not provided with secondary luxury facilities. <br/>Double glazing is appropriate in the flashy new hotels or new homes in the city. <br/>The price asked for the overnight stay compared to similar B&Bs on the same canal belt is the same. <br/>Since inflation and the rise in fixed costs, we as B&B owners are forced to go along with the upward price increases. <br/>Otherwise, for example, we would not be able to afford the high energy bill etc for my guests. At all times I have a reasonable price that fits the economic changes and the season. <br/>The photos were taken by a professional photographer. I don't know what kind of lens he used. I do know that I often hear from returning guests that the apartment is larger in reality than in the photos. <br/>Thank you for your feedback. <br/>It was an honor to have you as quests. <br/>Always welcome back! Now I am deeply shocked, yet I already expected this.<br/><br/>So Airbb has proven you wrong and declared that there were no bedbugs AT ALL ! But since they refused to give you any money back you have decided to put a bad review.<br/><br/>As you see Luiza, none of any other guests has complained about bedbugs AT - ALL. You have sent pictures to Airbb which were clearly not from our room(s). And when Airbb decided not to give you any money back due to our inspector‚Äôs inspection you decided to lie about it on our review as well.<br/><br/>For years we‚Äôve been upholding the rank of ‚ÄúSuper Host‚Äù. This is not given easily. Yet you can see and read back that none of the guest(s) ever said anything about bedbugs. <br/><br/>I see and understand your way. Since we declared trough a company and after the inspections that there were no bedbugs found, you‚Äôre here putting a review with, yet, another lie about bedbugs.<br/><br/>I‚Äôm so sorry for you, and if you truely need money, I honestly hope that everything gets sorted for you again.<br/><br/>Yet I will not publish the damages and dirt you left behind in our room. You‚Äôve left pans and cutlery completely dirty in the kitchen until they started to be rotten. We have renewed the entire kitchen supplies due to the damages you have brought. <br/><br/>Returning to this accommodation will not be accepted tho. Hi Kaziwa,<br/><br/>I'm honestly shocked by your review. <br/><br/>First of all: You wanted to leave your luggage at the destination. Unfortunately and due to the safety of your own luggages we do not accept that. The reason why we do not accept that, were also explained. During the time of when the housekeeping is cleaning we do not have anyone who could watch your luggages. So that's why we decided not to hold onto your luggages until your arrival.<br/>Yet, we explained you in all the detail, that there is a luggage storage, which is fully secured for large and small lugages, which was litteraly 3 minutes of walk away from the accomodation. That storage is the cheapest, but safest one in town.<br/><br/>Then the rest of your review about bad smells etc?<br/>It's weird to see and read that you are the only one complaining about this? I see that you absolutely did not like the fact that you could drop the luggages, and that's why you decide to give the review more information which is not true to make it look as bad as possible, which I am really shocked about.<br/><br/>We litteraly did everything we could in order to give you a pleasant stay. The room is well filled with glasses, plates for a use for two persons.  Also, I've checked the shower pressure personally after your departure, but it was all good, yet nobody complained about that aswel. <br/><br/>Blankets, towels etc, yet nobody, nor you asked for more, and even if more is needed there is a very large laundery room, downstairs of which you could easy access in order to take anything you need.<br/><br/>Floors noisy: As stated onto the advertisement, we've repeatedly writen that it's a monumental building, thus the noisy floors are a typical Amsterdam thingy. If you would've taken a few minutes to read trough the description you would read all of these things onto our description.<br/><br/>Noisy birds.... Now I see it very harsh to read from you that it's my(host) his fault that the birds are flying by? I'm sorry Kaziwa I cannot also host the birds into the streets, nor can I avoid the nature to not come by specially for your own goods. Besides that..... The advertisements stated clearly: CITY CENTER! <br/><br/>But after-all thank you for staying and the positive feedback, as a small advice I would like to give you; read trough the place description very well before booking another place.<br/><br/>Thank you. Hi Matilde, I'm sorry that you were bothered by the noise. You stayed in one of the busiest periods of the year and as you might have noticed the whole city center was very crowded. We do everything we can to give our guests a great experience, but some issues are out of our hands. I hope you  can understand that.:) It was nice to meet you and help you with leaving your luggage before and after the check- in & out. You re welcome! ;).. Het enige probleem was dat er geen warm water en verwarming is. Dit was een centraal probleem in Amsterdam bij meerdere plekken. Jammer dat je nu een liegt en andere dingen erbij verzint! Je hebt een volledige refund gehad. Sorry for the inconvenience caused by the heating failure. <br/>Fortunately, it was quickly resolved with a heating service. <br/>Heating in Canal Houses can sometimes fail for a while because parts need to be replaced given the monumental antiquity of the beautiful canal house. <br/>Thank you for coming and apologies for the force majeure defect. I am deeply shocked.<br/><br/>So as the one and only review I see that you disliked the place because it was dirty ? Now if we look trough all the reviews nobody has ever said the things you‚Äôve said. You have stayed within the heart of Amsterdam with a private bathroom, kitchen and toilet. Spacious room with TV, Netflix and WiFi. Plus the entire room was completely filled with utilities, mini bar full of foods and drinks, perfectly cleaned place by an original known cleaning company, yet you write a lie of a review on our topic and telling the rest that it‚Äôs too expensive ?<br/><br/>I‚Äôm shocked and I‚Äôm sure nobody will ever believe you. Thanks for staying, nor will I recommend you to any other host.<br/><br/>My superhost title has a reason.<br/><br/>Thank you and have a wonderful use of AirB&B. I am so deeply shocked by your review. I still cannot believe you‚Äôve been lying that much within the review. There was never a promise of refund nor ‚Äúwe stop talking goodbye or whatsoever ! It‚Äôs a shame we cannot upload any screenshots as evidence. <br/><br/>You‚Äôve been literally threatening me trough Airbnb the whole time even though everything could‚Äôve been solved on a professional way. Of course you kept on going with your non adult behavior.<br/><br/>Anything you say about the pet will not even be answered since you‚Äôre overloaded with lies.<br/><br/>Your review is the first review in 5 years. As you and everybody could see I‚Äôve received the rank super host. If your story was true I would‚Äôve never receive any of the review you‚Äôve spoke about. You‚Äôre not to believe at all by this means. I‚Äôve had thousands of guests and literally non of what you‚Äôve stated is right. We‚Äôve reported you and the damages you‚Äôve brought to the place to Airbnb and local police force though.<br/><br/>You were in the beginning very happy with the booking and also the room as shown on the pictures and reading the room discription.<br/><br/>Upon your arrival you tried to declare that we have advertised a whole other room then given ?<br/>Which is actually weird since all the rooms are and look exactly the same, thus also got exactly the same utilities. Even the colors match. I understand you were not happy with the size of the room, but this is a very normal and regular size of a room. Not to small not to big. You came with very weird stuff and pictures which created a complete wrong illusion for yourself  and thus tried to get your money back on this way.<br/><br/>Staying already 5 years in this business and using 5 years AirBB as super host he is the first one who complained about it.<br/><br/>During his booking we clearly told him that we‚Äôre making only one exception for you to come by with his dog. Taken for granted and still not happy with the place. Since we would lose this booking and we‚Äôre not able to accept any other bookings we gave him the right to leave the room, by own responsibility since we do not refund for such a reason. Still the first and only one who complained about the room not being the same as advertised.<br/><br/>Then youdecided to leave the place, and we gave you instructions to please close the windows and doors and leave everything in good state. We were sure that you would leave as a mature.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I arrived 1,5 hour later and was shocked by the looks how you left it.<br/><br/>Glasses broken, floor scratched(most probably by the dog) bed dirty, windows and doors left open, hangers damaged.<br/><br/>Although before you left you were really insultive and disrespectful trough AirBB.<br/>Then you tried to claim a refund trough AirBB support.<br/>Since we are super hosts, AirBB believed us and refused to refund anything to you.<br/><br/>Not happy with the room, that could happen but leaving it like this, is completely not professional and surely not adult-like.<br/><br/>After 5 years of being AirBB superhost I have never met such a horrible guest.<br/>I‚Äò‚Äôm deeply shocked by this.<br/><br/>Never again and highly unrecommended guest ! Hi there ! Unfortauntely to hear although we do our very best to give you a pleasant stay.  I am shocked to read this review..<br/><br/>At first you were very inactive and uncommunicative. We had to wait weeks before you could tell us when you would arrive.<br/><br/>Even on the same day you did not answer any of the messages where we‚Äôve asked what time you would arrive.<br/><br/>I received a message on airb&b 25 minutes after the check-in time. You were standing at the wrong street and street number even though we wrote down the correct address. Yet you sent a message that you couldn‚Äôt find it. We then found out you were standing in a whole other street and street number then the accommodation. Since we did not receive any messages, we left the accommodation and returned right when you said that you would be there.<br/><br/>At the end you filed a complaint that you wanted your money back even though it was your own mistake. Then saying stuff like that the bathroom was not clean enough? I‚Äôm shocked since as you could see none of the other guests complained about that. I wouldn‚Äôt be able to earn my super host position though.<br/><br/>Unfortunately.<br/><br/>The room was left clean and normally after all. Hi Fransesca, <br/>I almost never reply to reviews, but as I said before , It's so unfair to say all these things after all what happened. It was a big snowstorm in Amsterdam and I was stucked in the other side of the city at my place. In the late evening, around 21.30, I received a call of Airbnb if I could host you because of the issues on the airport. All flights were cancelled  and you actually had to stay in the airport. From experience I know how it is to sleep in an airport and even it was late, I decided to host you at my place. The price was superlow and not worth it, but I just did it from a good intention. My parents who live quite nearby came to give you the key around 23.00. They are old and they walk 25 minutes in the snow to give you the key so you didn't have to sleep in the airport. I thought you were happy with the place, but the next day I received this review. Please understand me well that I think reviews can be really helpful , but in this situation, I think it's really hard to give this reply. Says so much about you and I feel almost sorry for you. I will contact Airbnb to remove the review and I appreciate even more the good reviews and happy guests. "

16211727,"It was a pleasure meeting you and Alice! Happy to host you both and to read your pisitive review. P.S. Thankyou for making the bed when you left :) Hi Tom, <br/><br/>It was nice to meet you too and I hope you enjoyed your stay. Not a problem about the beer - it was yours to enjoy :)<br/><br/>Kind regards,<br/>Kirsten"
16274382,"Hi Susan.  Thank you for your review.  I don't think the room is small. Its  a normal room with 2 big single beds,  cupboard,  fridge & microwave.  The room is very ideal for Amsterdam city center.  Over the bathroom & toilet is very clear on the advertisement thats its shared. Hello,<br/>1. First of all out of all my recensies ( almost 150 positive reviews) you are the  first people to write a very negative review so I don't agree with your review. Our communication from the begining was already a problem and that makes me wonder if you have a problem with a certain group of people.                                                     2. My cleaner was there before you came in and he controled everything and the toilets and bathroom were clean so for you to say there was fieces in the toilet I find it very disrespectful because its a lie.                                                                                                      3. In the advertisement I have made it very cleary that the room is a bit small for 3 people but the beds are confortable so you could have known from the begining that it would be small for 3.<br/> I always let the guest know that first.                                                                              4. The shower head is just perfect there was no problem with it <br/>5. The washmachine and drier were not broken.  I only allow guest to do the wash when i'm around but this time I was not around when you wanted to do the wash and I apologised about that. I should have told you earlier. <br/> Please learn how to speak the truth in the future and never judge a host based on the colour, race or origin. <br/>Thank you! Hello Karl, thank you for your review.  About the cleaning due to unavoidable circumstances my cleaner could not clean earlier. I had even told you in advance & gave you my excuses.  About the ventilation, If you could have told me, I could have asked my cleaner to put it on. He accidentally pushed it off while cleaning. Hello Kate,<br/>Thank you for your nice review.  The reason it was expensive is because you booked for one person.  <br/>For 2 or more people then is less expensive.<br/>Best wishes, <br/>Gina Thank you so much for your nice review. Glad you had a great time in Amsterdam. Best wishe. Thanks Abdul for the nice review . All the best.  Thank you for your review Donatila . It was nice to host you.  Hello Daniel,<br/>Glad you both  had a great time at the apartment.<br/>I love making dutch breakfast for my guests  (uitsmijter)  in the morning if I'm available.<br/>Best wishes. <br/>Gina Katrina,<br/>I'm glad you both  had a great time.<br/>Welcome back to Amsterdam!<br/>Best wishes,<br/>Gina Sure, thats the key. ""making guests feel at home''. <br/>Thanks for the nice comment. <br/>Best wishes,<br/>Gina Hello Dalius,<br/>Glad to hear you had a great time in the apartment.<br/>Welcome back and best wishes to you and your son.<br/>Gina Bonjour Pierre,  Il √©tait bien vous accueillir . Glad vous avez eu un excellent s√©jour. Meilleur wishes. Gina Fijne dat jullie een goed tijd hadden in Amsterdam. Jullie zijn hartstikke weer welkom. Groetjes, Gina il √©tait agr√©able pour vous et vos amis h√¥te. Je suis heureux que vous ayez pass√© un bon moment √† Amsterdam . Meilleurs voeux. Il √©tait agr√©able de vous accueillir.

Maar wat ik het meest belangrijk vind is dat ik weer met een vergeten ding zit.waar ik echt niet zit op te wachten,maar een reactie van Bnb is bij deze hoop ik begrepen. Niet dus denk ik dan maar.best leuk om zo nu en dan supperhost te zijn.maar waar zijn de echte waarderingen in de zin van. Als ik een vraag heb of een probleem heb gehad zijn jullie niet te bereiken.maar goed dat is ook jullie verdienmodel mag ik aannemen . Een vraag mag toch een wederhoor kunnen horen. Want zo leren we van ons dingen die altijd beter kunnen! Dankjewel voor je ResponsüòÄüëçAndr√© het blijft een kleine ruimte maar zo is het ook Geadverteerd .

16776262,"Thank you very much for the lovely review Matthew. We enjoyed having you as guests very much and hope to welcome you again in the future. We loved having you as our guests Susan. Always welcome here again. Thank you Nicole. It was a joy to host you. Always welcome here again. Thank you for your review Katy.<br/>As I recollect you booked this apartment for you and your boyfriend. We therefore prepared the best bedroom for you, the master bedroom. At check-in, to our host's surprise you were joined by your father as well. As a maximum of 4 guests can stay here, he would have been more than welcome, but he claimed to have booked a nearby hotel. When our host came over to fix the heating system, she discovered that your father was apparently staying in the second bedroom and was not staying in a nearby hotel. As indicated on our profile, we have an extra charge for all guests after two. We asked for you to pay the extra charge for the unannounced third guest. It is all a matter of trust. Thank you Dominic for the lovely review. We of course hoped for the full 5 star review and would like to know what in your opinion could use modernizing.. As we always renovate where needed and clean it very well before our guests arrive, we were wondering if there are more things we could do to improve our hospitality. Thanks again. Hi Alison, thank you so much for your lovely review. It was a pleasure to have you stay at the Southern Comfort. Please allow me to comment on the part where you refer to the elderly and children. Maybe you are right if it concerns people who are impaired in their mobility, but if that is not the case people of any age can use the stairs. We've had many children visiting already, from babies and toddlers to 5 and 14 year olds. It hasn't been a problem at all. As we have protection that can be placed at the stairs and garden doors that will prevent accidents. We also provide a baby bed and dining chair by the way. In fact we are checking in a familly with young children again this weekend. Happily so, because we love young families. Thanks again Alison. All the best. We hope to welcome you again. We will welcome you and your beautiful young familly gladly Xander. Enjoy la douce France."

16916490,"Dear Onat, Thank you for the tip for some shelves and eye blinds :)! All the Best! Oliver and Barbare were the best guests to have ! Not only for kindness, their cleanliness and politeness. They are great personalities which, for me, were feeling as we could be friends.  I can just recommend them to welcome them for 105% :-)<br/>"

17069976,Wat jammer om mijn eerste 3 sterren recensie te mogen ontvangen na een enorme wolkbreuk. Een groot deel van de stad had op dat moment te maken met wateroverlast. Gelukkig was ik thuis en kon in zelf met aangeboden hulp door jullie de wateroverlast binnen enkele minuten oplossen. Gelukkig nog nooit eerder een dergelijke situatie meegemaakt. Thank you Carla for staying at my house.
17187656,"thank you, Sandy and welcome back! Muchas gracias Jacqueline! Welcome back Thank you Lisa! . Sorry to read about the windows, you should have asked us,  as  actually the window above the bed can be opened!<br/>Welcome back. Thank you and welcome back √ñmer. thanks Sean and welcome back! Danke sch√∂n Sebastian! haha leuk, piratenhuis! Bel ons gerust als je terug wilt komen. Danke  sch√∂n, Lukas und auf Wiedersehen! thanks Josh and welcome back! Danke Habbo, welcome back Merci beaucoup! thank you and welcome back! dank en welkom terug! grazie mille, Samuel!e thank you and welcome back! grazie Giulio! Arrivederci. thanks and welcome back! dank,Lucas welkom terug! thank you and welcome back Claudia! Thank you Tobias!  it was a pleasure to host you and welcome back! thank you Craig, welcome back! merci beaucoup Isabelle et au revoir! Dank je Marc, welkom terug! Thank you Agus! Welcome back. Muchas gracias, Daniela! We hebben behalve de pelletkachel die de ruimte in 5-10 minuten goed warm maakt, een  tweede kachel in de vorm van  een elektrische plaat, die je ''s nachts aan kunt laten, die heb ik jullie ook getoond bij aankomst.  Wel jammer dat jullie die niet gebruikt hebben, die zou de kamer ook ''s nachts goed warm hebben gemaakt.  We vinden het altijd fijn als gasten ons direct rechtstreeks melden als iets niet goed bevalt, Desnoods hadden we n√≥g een elektrische blower erbij kunnen geven. We vinden de pelletkachel qua Co uitstoot niet goed om de hele nacht aan te laten. Als je het alleen via een review meldt kunnen we niets meer voor jullie betekenen helaas. thank you Leif! thank you Roberto, and welcome back! thanks ,and welcome back! an extra electric heater is there for cold  nights;) Dank je wel Jayesh en welkom terug! dan kan je de fiets alsnog  uitproberen ;-) welcome back Ebony! Sorry to hear Cristina, that you were not fully satisfied. We do our utmost to give a pleasant stay to our guests. Walking distance to metro Spaklerweg is 1,8 km but normally people don't need 30 minutes for that. But for that reason we provide the bikes. Wat vervelend Pascale ,dat jullie geen goede ervaring hadden in ons fijne tuinhuis, de meeste mensen geven  5 sterren. Heel vreemd, het raam kan altijd open en we hebben nergens schimmel...de douche is namelijk net helemaal vernieuwd.  Het klopt dat het huisje verzakt is en de vloer scheef is, dat heeft voor de meeste mensen ook zo zijn charme en op de foto's en in de beschrijving kan je duidelijk zien dat het geen nieuwbouw is. Jullie zijn dus duidelijk meer types voor een spik en span hotel in de stad. <br/>We zijn wel van plan de vloer aan te passen binnenkort. Danke sch√∂n Anja! merci Maria! thanks Ian, welcome back! welcome back Lillie grazie mille, Gianluca! Thank you so much Debra, it was lovely to have you here and even  to be able to give all three of you a reading:) grazie mille Riccardo! Merci beaucoup Malicia!<br/>Au revoir:) merci beaucoup  et au revoir! Thanks and welcome back Rick! Gracias Alicia! Merci a vous! Het spijt ons dat je geen goede ervaring had bij ons Vaslilki, in tegenstelling tot vele andere gasten die juist heel blij zijn met onze bijzondere plek..<br/>Er staat onder de foto met stadsstrandje duidelijk bijgeschreven dat dit in de buurt is(op 5 min fietsafstand), niet dat je er uitzicht op hebt vanaf het  gastenverblijf.<br/>Dus daar is niets misleidends aan maar het us wel belangrijk dat je goed leest. Andere gasten hebben zich daar een hele dag in de warmte goed vermaakt.<br/>Onze plek is  enigszins aan de rand van de stad met een prachtige tuin, maar in deze tijd van het jaar zijn er helaas ook spinnetjes. We maken tussentijds het verblijf altijd grondig schoon en halen alle spinnetjes weg. in de extreem vochtige weken die we afgelopen voorjaar en het begin van deze zomer helaas hadden, is het echter onmogelijk om te voorkomen dat ze niet alsnog weer zijn. Dank voor jullie verblijf, Gwenaelle! het was ook voor ons een plezier om jullie te hosten.<br/>Fijne kampeerweek nog in het Noorden van Nederland. en welkom terug. wel heel jammer dat je ons zo negatieve beoordeeld Lukas aangezien er echt retirement veel regen gevallen was de dagen dat je er was.  en het is een huisje in de tuin waardoor de kans op spinnetjes in dit jaargetijde inderdaad aanwezig is. we halen ze altijd allemaal weg bij het schoonmaken maar als je bijvoorbeeld tijdens je verblijf de deur open laat staan kunnen ze wee binnenkomen.<br/>Ook de kleine badkamer staat duidelijk vermeld in de beschrijving . De pelletkachel verwarmt het huisje binnen 5 minuten, als je die even aan had gedaan verdrijft die alle nattigheid. merci bien Xavier! It was a pleasure to have you as our guests, Camille! <br/>Welcome back thank you Seren and friends, welcome back Dank en welkom terug Sven! grazie! thank you Jason and welcome back! Dankjewel Max, welkom terug! Thank you! thank you Bryan and welcome back! thank you Graziele! welcome back Merci beaucoup! thanks Holly! merci beaucoup , Vincent et au revoir! thank you Sammy and welcome back merci beaucoup danke sch√∂n! thanks Melissa and welcome back! Wel are very sorry to hear that you had this experience. I think our pictures and descriptions are quite clear about the size of our room.  About the other things it would have been nice if you told us directly what you dislike.... and we never get these comments from other guests we clean everything very thoroughly each time. anyway we wish you all the best. dank jullie wel! danke sch√∂n Alexander!  <br/>it was a real pleasure to host you, welcome back! Merci beaucoup, Alexandre! Danke sch√∂n Paula  und auf Wiedetsehen gracias Sole thank you very much Shadra and welcome back! thank you Gina and Ra√∫l! merci beaucoup! Danke sch√∂n, Astrid und auf wiedersehen! Danke sch√∂n Anna und auf Wiedersehen! thanks Dominic! thanks a lot and welcome back! merci Marine merci beaucoup Lucie! thank you and welcome back Maximiliian! Het spijt ons  dat jullie die ervaring hadden We doen altijd ons best het huisje heel schoon te maken en de meeste gasten ervaren dat ook zo. Het openbaar vervoer is helaas 20 minuten lopen maar daarom bieden we ook fietsen aan. Youre welcome thank you and welcome back! Het was fijn om jullie als gast te hebben.<br/>Wie weet tot ziens Muchos gracias Aurora! welcome back Alexia! merci! hartelijk dank Marie en welkom terug! Hartelijk dank en welkom terug! Thank you and welcome back Cristian! Hartelijk dank Dennis en welkom terug! Thanks Vijay and welcome back! welcome back Akis! Thank you very much for your stay Milica, welcome back again! Merci bien Gui! Muchas gracias Victor! Thanks Isha welcome back Yes it was a pity of the bike...but thanks for your stay Hartelijk dank en welkom terug Philippe! Thank you and welcome back! Youre welcome Hartelijk dank Camille en welkom terug! Hartelijk dank Vincent, welkom terug! Welkom terug Davide! Thank you Nika! Merci beaucoup Yann! Hartelijk dank Rajesh en welkom terug! Danke sch√∂n, Sabine! Thank you and welcome back! Dank je wel en welkom terug! Dat hopen wij ook, Jasmine welkom terug! Dank Linda en welkom terug! Welkom terug Thomas! Beste Francis,<br/>Het is heel jammer dat jullie onze 3 gasten fietsen niet hebben gebruikt. Dat maakt de verbinding met de stad een stuk sneller en gemakkelijker. Bovendien hebben we vanaf onze locatie 2 manieren om naar de stad te gaan, de ene brug via de snelweg(die jullie waarschijnlijk hebben genomen) of via de andere brug waarbij je als het ware door het bos loopt of fietst en langs de rivier de Amstel, dat is een veel leukere route.  Dat is jammer dus voor jullie ervaring. We zullen dit toekomstige gasten duidelijker uitleggen.<br/>Elke keer dat we schoonmaken halen we alle spinrag en eventuele spinnetjes weg maar aangezien we een beetje buiten wonen en augustus en september echt de soinnentijd is kunnen we dit helaas niet helemaal voorkomen.<br/>Ook het feit dat het een kleine ruimte is zeker voor 3 personen, staat duidelijk in de beschrijving.<br/>We hopen toch dat jullie van jullie verblijf hebben genoten. Hartelijk dank en welkom terug! Dank je Rika en welkom terug ! Dank je Eline, welkom terug! Dank je Eline, welkom terug! Dank je Giounis welkom terug! Jammer dat je ons niet tijdens je verblijf hebt laten weten wat jullie stoorde dan hadden we er meteen iets aan kunnen doen. Alles wordt grondig schoongemaakt na elke gast, tot nu toe nebben we nooit problemen gehad.  Het spijt ons dat jullie deze ervaring hadden. thanks Lucia and you are welcome back! it was a pleasure to have you here and we were really sorry for all the rain during your stay... Dank voor je verblijf Grazie, Andrea! Thank you Tobias and welcome back! Glad that you liked it Andrea, welcome back! merci beaucoup Lucas! Oui, au plaisir de revoir! thank you dear Madison, it was so nice meeting you and talking to you! Hope to be in touch again. Merci beacuoup B√©atrice!

Dank je wel en welkom terug Irene Thanks Delf Thanks .Welcome back Thanks Bill! Thank you Kate and welcome back! Welkom terug Herwig! Yes we cannot change our location and you could have seen the location when you booked.<br/>Unfortunately you had also very rainy weather and you came too early so had to wait...But I am happy that you like our place.<br/>Kind regards  Marga It is a pity that you thought the stove was empty Megan as it was still full and would have heated  the room well enough for sure! So for future guests no worries about this. We will explain  better Thank you! Merci bien! Au revoir Thank you Thank you Nathan  welcome back! Thank you!

It was a pleasure to host you Rhian non, welcome back! Welcome back! Welcome back Lacey! Thanks and welcome back Thomas! Thank you Jonathan welcome back! Thank you Jan, welcome back any time! Okay thanks. Location is clear when you book and also described 10 minutes walk..so to give 3 stars for that?But thanks for your stay anyway! Merci beaucoup! Yes walking from central station is gar but you could have taken public transport.‚ò∫ <br/>You can see when you book where our listing is. Is has its own charm not being central but also giving you some feeling of nature and yet close to the city. <br/>Thanks for your stay and welcome back Welcome back Devin! Ja das war es‚ò∫ Welcome back! Better read description of the listing before your book and even better: go to a hotel in town.. And it was a mutual feeling...we also were not pleased with your messy behaviour It was a pleasure to host you Kelsey, welcome back! Thank you Nicholas welcome back! Marga and Rico Thank you Sophia it was a pleasure to host you,  welcome back! Thank you John and welcome back! Thanks,  the guesthouse is in the garden though and only our houseboat on river Amstel‚ò∫ Thank you and welcome back! Dank je wel Nynke!  Heel leuk dat je er was en welkom terug. Thanks Tom looking forward to the third time ‚ò∫ Thank you Kristen it was a pleasure to host you and welcome back (with your friends‚ò∫) Thanks Mo and welcome back! Thank you Mark,  welcome back! Thanks Darby, welcome back! Thanks Glyn all best to you too and welcome back!I am curious about your Lebanon adventure Thank you Zak it was a pleasure to host you and your girlfriend,  welcome back! Dank Hans, welkom terug! Thank you Ashley,welcome back!<br/>When we are home we are flexible and let people check in also in the morning to store their luggage...unfortunately we were out of town yesterday  morning. Thank you Charles yes please come back in summertime when biking is fun!the walk to the nearest public transport is 15-20minutes but probably you walked all the way to the center in 45! Thanks but we don't understand why you are so positive and give us 4 and 5 stars for all details and then only 3 stars for the overall experience? But never mind.... Thank you Richard. Yes unconveniently the heater was not on though I thought I had turned it on for you already at 6am.Welcome back in summertime‚ò∫ Thanks Martin welcome back. I found a cufflink on the ground...sent you a picture..is it yours? Very happy that you liked it Ben, welcome back! Thanks Michael, welcome back! Better not book this if you don't speak English and can't read the description of our listing. If you can read English you would have known that it is 15.20 minutes walk from a public transport.. we also offered you a free pick up at Victoria plein but you were too early and came walking.   and a ride to the airport for 20 euro but you didn't want.that. It was not possible to explain anything to you like the use of the woodstove. So not recommended to other Korean people who don't speak English. . Merci beaucoup! Thank you Ryan, welcome back Thank you Jess, welcome back! Thank you Yuko welcome back! Thank you Maria,welcome back! Thanks Elisabeth! Dear Shiho you were a sweet guest, welcome back. It is a garden house where you stayed, not in our houseboat which is nearby‚ò∫ Thank you Jacob!really nice meeting you and welcome back! Dear Margaux  we are really sorry about this ..last weekend I was in a training that is why I asked my son to receive you on Saturday for even providing you an early check in (officially it is 6 pm and then I would have been home!) So that was to be flexible with you and Sunday morning my husband Rico got ill. And we had to go the the hospital.<br/>Normally we receive our guests personally and like to chat with them.<br/>Thanks for your stay anyway and I do hope you will come back so we can meet! Dank jullie wel Nikita thank you Damian, it was really nice meeting you and we hope you will come back! Thank you Tom, welcome back Thank you Anne-Marie....we have put soap!thanks for reminding us  it was finished Thank you Dagny and Louis Thanks Yanick, welcome back! Thanks Viktor,  welcome back Dankjewel Monique jullie zijn van harte welkom Thanks Jessica! Thank you Camilla, welcome back! Thank you Alexis, welcome back! Thank you Pablo, welcome back! Thank you Sarah, welcome back! Thank you Harrison, welcome back! Of course it is fixed immediately, Liz. <br/>As we answered all the thousands questions and remarks you had immediately<br/><br/>it happened not to be a leak but because of the draught during the period before the wood of the ceiling was¬¥working¬¥as we say in Dutch.<br/>. <br/>There is a woodstove in the guesthouse to use and you can make coffee and tea. Cooking facilities aren¬¥t there and also not mentioned in the listing. We have many guests staying for a week or even two  and they go for dinner in town. Thank you Dan, welcome back! Thank you Alexis and welcome back! Dank je wel Justin. We zien je terug ;-) Thanks Madina,  welcome back! Danke Julia! Gracias! Thanks  Maren, welcome back! Thanks Amanda,welcome back!

Herzlichen Wilkommen bei einem n√°chsten Mal. Thank you, Haoyang, welcome back! Thank you, Yue, welcome back! Thank you,  Yi- Hsuan, welcome back! Dank je wel Charlotte, welkom terug! Thanks Thomas, you were a nice guest, it was a pleasure hosting you, welcome back! Thank you Kristi, welcome back! Thanks Yoriki,welcome  back! Dank je wel Sien en Hannes, het was gezellig om jullie als gasten te hebben. Welkom terug! Thanks Benjamin, and yes, hopefully next time in summer, it was very cold during your stay. Welcome back! Thanks Jordan, welcome back! Thanks Luce,  it was very nice having you as our guest, welcome back! Thanks Brendan and welcome back! Thanks and welcome back, Meredith! Sorry to hear that you didn't feel comfortable Ammar. It was a really cold week, coldest of this winter, and we did our utmost to help you with heating room like preheat it by making fire in the woodstove before you came home. And you had two electric wall heaters and even an electric blanket and an electric blower to turn on in the morning. You could have read in the description of our listing that there is no bathroom in the guesthouse(we are not allowed to build that in the garden), but in the entrance hall of our houseboat. And we also tunred n the heaitng in this abthroom every morning early so the small room itself was heated quite well I think. Most guests do appreciate the very authentic and cosy amosphere of the whole,, and for you it might have been better to pay more and go to a hotel.  You wanted to drop your luggage on Monday morning 8.30 and as the guest of the night before left very early I even did my best to clean the room before you came. As you were in a hurry at that time you might not have got enough explanation of all the heatings etc. as we normally give during check in. And the nearest transport is 15 minutes walking away and you could have rent a bike from us. This is also written in the listing and it was written on a paper in the room. any way, I wish you all the best and hope you will check your next listing more carefully befor y ou book. Thanks Gordon, welcome back! Muchas gracias, Luis! Thanks for your stay Abdelmale, it was a pleasure to host you! Welcome back. Dak je wel Wout, welkom terug Thank you Rod, welcome back! Thank you Olavi, next time I would like to hear you playing the guitar;-) Thanks Callum, welcome back! Dank je wel Olaf, en welkom terug.  De douche is inmiddels weer in orde, dank nog voor je flexibiliteit. Thank  you Harsh, welcome back! Thank you Louis, welcome back! Thanks Wenting, welcome back. Thanks  Andy, it was nice meeting you and welcome back! Thanks Alexi and Candice, you were very nice guests! welcome back Dank je wel Julia, erg leuk dat je er was en van de piano gebruik kon maken met het inzingen. Hopelijk tot ziens! welcome back Carlotta Thank you Misa, welcome back! Thank you David, welcome back! Thank you Fabrice, we hope to see you again Thanks Tom, welcome back! Thanks a lot, Tom!Welcome back Thank you Erich and Marianela, welcome back! Grazie! Arrivederci. Thanks Michelle, welcome back! Thanks a lot Rami,<br/>welcome back! Thank you Emily! Thank you Sara, welcome back!<br/> Thank you Dalia, welcome back! Thank you Charline, welcome back! Dank je wel lieve Susann en Guido, welkom terug! Thank you Andrew and Peter, welcome back! Danke sch√∂n, Irene! Thank you Helen, welcome back! Thank you Daphne, it was a real pleasure to have you as our guest and to give you an aura reading! Welcome back Thanks Landon, welcome back! Thank you so much Pia, welcome back! Merci beaucoup Claire et Thomas! Patrick, all the extra costs were described in the listing very clearly. We were quite surprised that you left without paying. Though we understood afterwards that you were in a hurry, it would have been nice if you had left at least the money and a note. But thanks for paying now by Paypal. <br/>The bikes costs us more then we earn money on it, as they need a lot of maintenance. In town you pay at least 12,50 a day to rent one so I think we are not very expensive in that. Same for washing 3 euro and drying 2. in town it costs 5 euro each at least. And it is not a normal bed and breakfast, it is an Airbnb listing and we offer our guesthouse for the nights and apart from that for those guests who choose that we also offer breakfast. <br/>And we told you that we are building another extra entrance hall on the terrace with a shower and toilet, so future guests, within a month from now, will not need to enter our houseboat anymore.<br/><br/> Rai station is 15 minutes walk and biking to museum square and Leidseplein (also center) for instance also only 15  minutes. Amsterdam is not that big.  <br/>It is good that you are honest and write down your concerns but I felt I also had to reply with our side of the story.   I didn't feel like you were a reall Airbnb guest but more like you used our precious home like a hotel. So for next time you book something on Airbnb maybe better read all the details of the listing if it suits you.<br/>We are very much eager to take care of all our guests in the best way possible. Thank you Sami, welcome back! Merci Mara et au revoir! Thanks Ryan, welcome back Thanks Olu, welcome back! Thank you Min Su, welcome back Thank you dear Sunniva and Hilde, also for your wonderful folkmusic that you played for me! Thanks Megan, welcome back! Thank you Esmeralda, welcome back! Thanks Christopher! Thanks and welcome back! Thanks Jon, Welcome back! Thank you Sara and welcome back! Thank you Kushtrim, welcome back! Thank you Damien, welcome back! Thank you Katey, welcome back! Thank you dear Alia!  also for the Japanese restaurant, I didn't know it. i see the website is hidden for readers but I can see it and will provide the address to our future guests!<br/>welcome back. Merci Jessica, au revoir! Thank you and welcome back! Thank you Samaneh and Sina, it was a pleasure to host you! Welcome back Welcome back dear Uhlrich! welcome back Laughton! Welcome back Anil! I hope the program that you followed will fullfil all your dreams. Thanks and welcome back Alex! Thank you dear Dale and David, welcome back! Thanks Mai welcome back! Thanks Kerenza and Natalia, I hope next time you can bring your violin/ viola with you! We would love to hear you playing. Thanks Lucinda, welcome back!  Thank you Mai, welcome back! Thank you dear Jonathan,  for your beautiful description of your stay with us. We really hope to see you back! Danke sch√∂n und auf Wiedersehen!  Thanks Lucy, welcome back! Thanks Helle, it was nice having you as our guest, welcome back! Thank you Yanuarga, welcome back! Thanks Sam! it was great to have you as our guests.   Sorry about the hard time finding it... Normally I offer a pick up form RAi too but that morning as you checked in early, I could not make it. Next time you will know the way! Grazie Lorenzo e arrivederci! Thanks George, welcome back! Thank you Oliver, and welcome back! Thanks Damian, welcome back! Sorry to hear that you felt uncomfortable Luis, it is clearly written in our listing though that we share the bathroom  with our guests,and  that it is in our houseboat.(we are not allowed to build a toilet in the garden)  We are totally fine with it, and most guests also don""t have any problem with it as they have read the text well while they booked the listing. .And apart from the woodstove, there are two electric theaters on the wall next to the bed and even an electric blower for the morning when you wake up.  And in wintertime even an electric blanket. So it can be comfortable... and many people like the woodstove very much. And very nearby on walking distance there is a restaurant (near the bridge) and in the street across the river many other restaurants. Biking is only 10-15 minutes  to a more lively area, and 20-25 minutes to the real center.    hi Fiona next to the bed were two electric heaters for the night and under the table also an electirc blower for use  in the morning. Due to your  very early check in we didn't give you a proper 'tour' and explanation I am a afraid.   We are not allowed to build a bathroom near  or  in the guesthouse in the garden  so  that is why it is a shared one with us. All kind of city rules ;( Hoi Niels, dank voor je bezoek. Lepeltjes, mes en afwasborstel lagen er wel bij de wasbak/vensterbank maar heb je wellicht over het hoofd gezien. Hopelijk tot een volgende keer! Hello Hayajin,   sorry to hear you had a hard time walking back in the night. best is when you are able to ride a bicycle then it is much easier and center is quite near (only 20 minutes by bike)  Thanks for your stay anyway! Thanks a lot Laura, I am sure we will meet again! Big hug Thank you Moneer, welcome back! Welcome back, in summertime Katia! Thank you Vasileios, I hope to meet you next time! Marga Thank you Alanna,  Glad that you had a good time! forwarded your message to Rico. And I hope  will meet you in future! Thanks Prabha, welcome back! Welcome back Lidor! Thanks and welcome back Hyewon!<br/> Thank you so much! Welcome back Always welcome home dear Anne ;) Thanks Adrian, and welcome back for a longer stay! Welkom terug, Christy en Aafke! Really a pity that the storm made you stay in town and so you couldn't stay with us Wesley! hopefully we can meet next time! We offer a pick up from RAI station if not too late and we have bikes for rent, so from that point fo view it is not too far from center and a much more quiet sleeping place;)    Thanks Larissa, welcome back! Thank you dear Andrea! it was nice meeting you! Merci beaucoup, Jean- Loup! Thank you Jingjing! Danke Simon!Immer willkommen Thank  you! Thank you Stefan, welcome back!

I am a bit surprised to hear about the towels etc, of course  everything was washed and clean. Nobody else ever said anything about that. But for European people it is not very fresh to put a towel on the floor like you did, probably to pray?  If you would have asked me I could  have given you something else for that. Thank you Virginie, all best Thank you and  I hope you will make it a long yearly tradition! merci beaucoup! Thank you very much Jason, welcome back! Merci beaucoup Fabrice, au revoir!

Thanks for staying with us, Prince! Sorry for your waiting at the tram stop- due to misunderstanding - me not being sure if you had read the message and your phone being empty. And not having a car at my disposal at that time. Normally pick up and check in is after 6pm, and we come when the guests have let us know when that they have arrived at the station or tram stop. It is an extra service anyway, that we offer, whenever it is possible.    And we liked you a lot as an unusual guest on a skateboard Victor! Always welcome back... Glad to hear Shauna, it was a real pleasure tot have you and Brad with us. Very nice to combine my being a host with  giving you two energyreadings!

Merci bien Jean-Philippe!Toujours les bienvenus.  Thank you Nadav, <br/>Always welcome back!<br/> Just after you left, we have made the woodstove functionable again in the guest house, Sebastian, so next time in this time of the year you can enjoy the really pleasant warmth of the burning wood... and it is also very cosy to look at!

17281398,"Thank you so much Barbara, you were great guest and left our house really clean! Allways welcome to come back, we would be glad!"
17321895,"I am very sorry you had a negative experience Terry. To respond to your specific complaints: <br/>The listing states that it‚Äôs a top floor apartment. Specifically it‚Äôs on the third floor. I agree that it should state that there is no elevator. I thought it did but I indeed don‚Äôt see that anywhere. <br/>Up until a half hour before you arrived I had the windows open in the master bedroom downstairs. I think it needed a bit more time to heat the room. I am sorry you felt cold.<br/>I did explain to your daughter Petra that there‚Äôs a degree or two difference between the upstairs and downstairs. So you just had to increase the temperature on the thermostat.<br/>The towels and all the linen were freshly cleaned. If they were not to your liking I wish you would have told me. There were fresh bars of soap and bottles of soap available. Again I wish you would have just asked. For everything, apart from the stairs, we could have found a solution for you. But you never asked, although I specifically said I was there to help you. <br/>But again I am really sorry our place didn‚Äôt live up to your expectations.<br/>We appreciate your candid review. We will learn from it. Sincerely, Alexander"
17323473,"thanks so much, Sidney. It was a great pleasure hosting you. You and your family are such nice people! Please come back whenever! So sorry for you, Patricia, that my house was not what you expected it to be. I really hope you found a place in Amsterdam that suited your wishes better. <br/>I wish I had welcomed you myself to show you how to lock the doors, how to get to the children's room without using the staircase. It was the first time I used the ""key-locker"" without being there myself. <br/>Thanks for your advice to inform the next (4) 'renters' about the shared front door and staircase. Luckily they all  red the description, were aware of this and are looking forward to come to my home. Again, I'm sorry you did not like it (you're my first non-5-star review in over 11 years.... and that's a shame). Thanks! üôèüèΩ‚òÄÔ∏è Wow, thank you David. <br/>It was a real, real pleasure to have you in my house. It is easy to take care of nice and friendly people, who enjoy the contact and the service!

I'm sorry about that.<br/>However, there is a detailed description of the apartment (rooms, size, amenities), on the website, including pictures (incl for the bathroom). This should give a fair representation of the amenities in the apartment."

18450996,"Das freut mich sehr zu lesen Moritz. Ich war auch sehr froh mit Euch als meine G√§ste! <br/>Ihr seid jederzeit wieder herzlich willkommen. I am glad to hear that yo had a good time here in my apartment and in Amsterdam. Please feel welcome any time. Thank you for your positive feedback Jessica. Wonderful to have you as guests.  Please feel welcome here again any time. I am glad to read that you had a fantastic stay at my place. I also enjoyed having you as guests very much. Please feel welcome  here again. Warm greetings Jordis Dear Kathrin I am glad to read that you had a good stay at my place. I enjoyed having you as my guests! Please feel welcome here again. Warm greetings Jordis You are very welcome Joana . I am happy to be of service. And you are welcome again any time my apartment is available It was lovely to have you in my house! Always welcome again.  Dear Assunta  I am glad to hear you had a good stay here and enjoyed the good service I provided.  I am sorry to hear that you experienced dust everywhere in my house as you write. To give a response and a more complete picture about my appartment :The appartment was one day before you arrived cleaned by a professional for 4 hours and in the best propper state it can be, including a hygenic kitchen, bathroom and shower. I checked on everything after the cleaning including on the dust! There will always be some dust to be found in a house where people live, and have bookshelfs etc. No way to avoid this. Maybe better to consider that a next time when you book a private appartement via Airbnb.   I write in response to your feedback about staying at my apartment: Dear Muriel and Patrick  A pity that you where disappointed staying at my house. I am surprised you thought that it's a house that's only for renting out to customers. This is the first time that happens. The photos show very clearly that it's a house that I and my daughter live's in our self. In my mail from 8 aug I even state very clearly that this is my personal living and workspace. If you wanted a house that is a vacation apartment only and not the personal home of someone I suggest to you to better check this before booking. <br/>As far as I understand is it part of the vision of Airbnb, to be able to feel home someplace while you travel. And what is more generous than sharing your personal space with strangers and lovingly open your doors in trust.  This is what I did. With Airbnb many people rent out their houses during vacations for some extra money. And so do I. It's not my main business and I never pretended it to be a professional hotel or such. I don‚Äôt think it makes sense to compare it with a vacation house with the purpose of being rented out only like you have yourself. Concerning the cleanliness in the house: All was very well cleaned, hygienic, dusted and mopped before you came, including under the bed.  Concerning your dust allergies. As a health practitioner myself, I take this serious and if I would have known before, I might have suggested you to better stay in a hotel than in an old Amsterdam house, where dust is not to avoid. A pity you did not communicate this with me or I at least would have been able to provide extra care. <br/><br/>You write it is a shame I did not respond to the note you left. To be honest it was very unpleasant to come back into my home being awaited with such extensive list of complaints and no appreciation at all. Your feedback felt very one-sided and stated in a way as being taught a lesson, you telling me how things should be instead of how you experienced it yourself. I did not feel invited to respond at all from your note, neither did I feel the urge to respond in the same negative way. It is due to your puplic feedback that I feel urged to respond in all honesty.  People have different standards, but at the end we are all responsible for our own expectations. <br/> It just makes me so happy to read that you enjoyed your stay at my house Anja! Thank you for your warm appreciative feedback. Also thanks for leaving everything so carefully placed and clean. It was wonderful to have you as guests here and please feel welcome to come again any time.  Please visit Amsterdam again Jeffrey and feel welcome at my place! Celebrating your birthday in Amsterdam needs a special treat. I am glad you enjoyed your stay.  Beste Hedwig Bedankt voor je recensie. Ik was heel blij met jullie als huurder in mijn huis en heb de goede communicatie gewaardeerd. Bedankt ook ervoor hoe schoon het huis was achter gelaten! Jullie zijn van harte weer welkom in mijn huis.    Thank you Marie -Helen! I am glad you enjoyed your time in Amsterdam and had a pleasant stay at my house! With my french reawakening. :-)"
18482089,"Hi Mel, thank you for the nicest review ever!!! Actually I felt sorry I did not offer you to show you more around, but I did not know you would appreciate this. <br/>Now you say you found me gentle and nice and even handsome hahaü§£. I am blushing. You are also sooo gentle and nice. And of course with your sweet and open appearance ü•∞ very handsome haha ü§£ Hi Gabriel, thank you for your very nice review!!! <br/>I am so sorry, I was too late to give you a review from my side. Your staying at our house was of course a 5 stars plus rate.<br/>Kind Regards, Klaas Thank you for your feedback! The little black handle of the keybox is indeed hard to open. I am going to find out if there is a better alternative. Thank you for your very nice review! I felt a little bit guilty because we did not have much contact because of Covid. Kind Regards and take good care, Klaas Thank you for your fantastic review and for the handpicked tulips from the flower fields!<br/>I would like to see you and your companion again in Amsterdam!  Maxime & Annie were wonderful guests. 100% reliable. I recommend them as guests. You will enjoy their stay. Hi Giulia, I am so sorry I was to late giving you a review. It would be of course 5* +++ . Everything went perfect. Thank you for you nice and detailed review! I appreciate it! Hi Franziska,<br/>I am sorry to hear the check-in was not good. <br/>You indicated that our house was difficult to find. This I don't understand. With GPS it should be very easy to find the house.  In Amsterdam there are a lot of cars. In the center the fee for parking is around ‚Ç¨ 7,50 per hour. We live in a suburb with no parking fee. In daytime there is no problem for parking. At night sometimes there is sometimes a lack of parking space, but mostly it is no problem.<br/>I tried to respond on your questions. At the arrival around 23.00 you could have ringed the bell, I was at home. It was good you used the keybox for not disturbing my family and other guests. <br/>If I can optimize the check-in, please let me know.<br/>Thank you for the nice and useful description in the review. This is of value for other guests,<br/>Kind Regards, <br/>Klaas I forgot to thank you for 'La Chouffe'. It is my wife's favorite Merci beaucoup pour ton gentil commentaire. Malheureusement, j'√©tais trop tard pour √©crire une review. J'esp√®re que vous l'avez appr√©ci√© √† Amsterdam, au march√© aux fromages d'Alkmaar et au match de football dans Johan Cruyff Arena.

Bye.<br/>Marion Dear Facundo, you are absolutely right about the internet, we recently have problems with that, we regret this and hope we can solve the problem soon. Thanks for your sweet review. Bye!! dear Sally and Michael, thank you for your very warm and positive review, it makes us happy to know that you liked your stay so much. <br/>Bye bye, Marion Dear Emily, <br/>Wow, thanks  for all the compliments,  you make my day!!  <br/>You MUST come back!!!  Ce n'est pas difficile d'√™tre des bons h√¥tes avec des visiteurs gentils comme Murielle et Jean-Michel. Ils sont toujour bienvenue ici. Hi Erica, thanks for your feedback, we also loved having you as our guests. We hope you had a good trip to Belgium. When you ever come to Amsterdam again, you are very welcome. <br/>Marion and Jang (with an a)   ;) Hi, thanks for the feedback. Normally our wifi works perfect, but a few days before you came there had been a problem with internet, so that may have caused bad wifi. I am sorry for that, I wish you had told me, I could have done something about it. <br/>Bye bye, Marion<br/> Thank you so much, haven't try the wine yet, but it will be the best ever! Ach, wat een superlieve en leuke reactie van jullie, dank je wel. Grappig wat je schrijft over de ADHDkat en de luie kat, precies zoals het is, fijn dat Remy jullie rust niet verstoord heeft; de onze verstoort ie regelmatig, haha. <br/>Klopt wat je schrijft over Amsterdam Noord, binnenkort en eigenlijk nu al, het hipste stukje Amsterdam. En dat terwijl een jaartje of 20 geleden echte Amsterdammers hun neus ophaalden voor Noord, 'daar wil je niet dood gevonden worden', zeiden ze. Nu is het: 'eerst Amsterdam Noord zien en dan sterven'!!!<br/>Kom gezellig een keertje thee drinken en de katten knuffelen als jullie in de buurt zijn. <br/>Groetjes van Marion en Jang"

19019597,"Dear Sibel,<br/>Thanks for your feedback! Untill now we had no comments about the one room with only matrasses on the floor. It is our daughter Jette's room. Her bed is the two matrasses on top of eachother. A new bed is on the way ;) <br/>Sorry to hear that two did not sleep so well..<br/>In the future (October 2017) it is not allowed anymore to rent out a private house to more than 4 persons, so this will be of no issue anymore. More than enough real beds for 4. When the rules change to more than 4 we will possibly buy a extra real bed ;)<br/>Our bathroom downstairs will get an update this weekend. <br/>We have 4 mirrors in the house. 1 in each bathroom, 1 big (total body) in the hallway upstairs and one big in the closet door (total body) in our bedroom upstairs.<br/>Regards, Joris<br/>"
19029497,"Wow, thanks! Yes, we were feeling so bad about you having to wake up and finding water all over the floor! It was a really bad storm (150 trees went down in 1 night), never experienced it before. And all that rain! You were all so flexible, really great guests. Thanks again for staying and you are always welcome! Dear Asha and family! Thanks for being percect guests as well! Glad you enjoyed your stay! It's really unfortunate your stay was not what you expected. As you can read below it does not happen often that we have dissatisfied guests, so we are very sorry for that. I think it was a bad combination of extremely hot weather, a repairman that did not do the job right with the drying machine, and some things we think we have described clearly in our ad, but apparently not, so we'll check on that.<br/>We had a severe heat wave in the Netherlands when you were here and the apartment has no airconditioning. We mention that in our ad. Normally you do not need one, because its the coolest part of the house. And we as Dutch people are more used to take arrangements of keeping the apartment warm than keeping it cool ;-). I am sorry it was uncomfortable to sleep in. It was an extreme situation. We provided a fan, but it turned out you wanted 2 and you did not tell us you needed one more, only when you had already left. And then we could not do anything anymore. <br/>We're really sorry about the drying machine not working. We just had it all fixed by a professional (as you can read in some reviews below we had trouble with the washing machine as well, so we had someone fix it), but after reading your review today we discovered that the repairman had replaced the machine in a way the water was not getting away in the right way. So it came back in the machine. We fixed it now. Because you were the first guests using the machine after the repairman had come, we did not discover it before. Ofcourse if you would have used it earlier and had mentioned it, we would have offered to wash and dry your laundry.<br/>Regarding the use of the patio, its written down in our ad for more than two years now. I can imagine its a pity, but there is a lot of green area around the apartment. And we mention quite clear that it's an apartment in a quiet area at a 15-20 minutes walk from the main sites in Amsterdam, exactly as you describe. But we will check in our ad if we can be more explicit about that as well.  Thanks for staying with us. Sorry about the small steps, the house is 150 years old and a monument, zo we are not allowed to change a lot. Glad you did not hurt yourselves and had a good time. You're always welcome! ‚ÄúMerci Resalieke pour votre accueil ! I I Thanks for staying! This is what you wrote: Passer quelques jours dans votre quartier a √©t√© une exp√©rience tr√®s agr√©able. Et l‚Äôappartement am√©nag√© par vous d‚Äôune fa√ßon tr√®s conviviale fut tr√®s appr√©ci√©. Au plaisir de vous revoir ! Elisabeth C.‚Äù Hi Harriet! Thank you again for staying! You were great guests! Grazi Mille ;-) Hi Stephanie, Thank you for your feedback. It's always good to know what we can do better. We have a new cleaner, so we passed on your remarks. And the cutlery was hidden in an unsuspected closet ;-), so that's why we both did not see it.  It's a pity we have not met. I told you on forehand my daughter would be there. She was there to give you an early check in, as requested by you. I guess she could have given you an introduction afterwards, you could have asked her that. But you have had our document on forehand with all information and all kinds of tips on where to go to. The whole apartment is filled with tips about the neighborhood.  I have checked several times to know if you were ok and you said you were. My daughter came in after you requested for someone to check the heating and she fixed it. You knew about her going over to check. I told you about it. You did not let us know when you were in or out and when you were leaving. I have asked several times when I was at home if we could meet or I could help you and you did not answer. It's a two-way-thing. Its a pity you felt this way and showed us not by telling me, but by leaving the apartment in a mess.  Hi, thanks for your review and compliments. Regarding the 'lack of fire'  in the kitchen: It is very clearly mentioned in our add that you cannot cook, so it should have been clear before you came. There are a lot of cheap places to eat out or take away. Besides that we do have a microwave, a cooker and a fridge, so you can heat up meals, make soup and eat salad and bread. We do not want fire in the kitchen because of a possible fire. The house you stay in is a national monument, so we do not want to take the risk. Thanks again for staying. Hi Dominic, It was really nice to have you guys as our guest. You survived Amsterdam despite all the rain ;-). The Tv turned outto be a general problem with our provider, so we fi=xed that. And the shower is someting we'll arrange too. So thanks for your feedback, always happy to provide better service."

19238739,"Dear Rachel,<br/>My name is Lara, owner of the apartment you rented in Amsterdam last July. Upon our return from a holiday abroad we found out about your complaints. We are so sorry that the conditions of the apartment made your stay in Amsterdam less pleasant. We had been working with the same hosting company for some years and nothing similar ever happened. The apartment has always been very clean and neat as you may notice reading the other older reviews. We confronted the service company immediately with your complaints and ended our collaboration with them. <br/>Our building and our whole neighbourhood, De Rivierenbuurt , was built in the late 1920s and is part of the famous Plan Zuid, created by the architect Berlage, now designated as a Protected Cityscape . These old buildings are rather noisy, there‚Äôs nothing we can do about that but I can assure you that the family living upstairs is almost never very loud. It is possible though that you may have heard people walking up and down the stairs or closing the front door of one of the apartments next to ours. We have an independent entrance but due to the fact that all the buildings are rather old, it is unavoidable to hear some noise."

If it wasn't for you asking me to pay you 200 euro's for a positive review, i would've done that with yours too. Let's agree on that we have different values in life. Again, i wish you all the best. ‚ù§Ô∏è! Thanks Eva!<br/><br/>I really liked your family. Hope you come back to Amsterdam one day and otherwise maybe in Taiwan!<br/>Bye,<br/>Pim"
19562807,"Thank you Martaüôè hope to see both next time, was an absolute pleasure to host you both. Dear James Thank you the wonderful review, sorry you got lost abit at central station, however there is always the option to take the metro to Nieuwemarkt and then it's a 5min walk. See you next time Dear Ali sorry to read about your dissappointing stay, cooking are not allowed in Amsterdam bnb any longer, hence no cooking is advertised, as to the oven, apologies a more thorough check will be done, considering this was the first report this year. Lastly staying in the city come comes with noise as also informed during your stay. Thank you for the feedback and we hope to improve going forward. Dear Johnny Apologies for my absence, as mentioned I was away on a business trip. Hopefully on your next visit we can meet. Glad you had a good stay A pleasure hosting Chris during a very hot week in Amsterdam, sleeping with doors and windows open can be noisy on weekends, however special monument windows and doors have been installed to prevent noise, when all doors and windows are closed."

19834309,"1. Building is 150 years old (which is a awesome thing) and completely renovated in traditional architectural style.<br/>2. Your (lastminute) rate was 125!<br/>3. Its 6 minute walk downtown/ Leidseplein. Taxi is 7,50 (of course it depending where you want to go)<br/>4. Appartment is luxurious and fully equipped<br/>"
19850735,"Well I am very sorry for Meete as she did not have the experience as she would like to have. I do have to say  my bikes are not not bring taken care of but they have a bit old look as they are not to be stolen. the y are maintained though, othereise I would not give them for guest and they are a bonus so for free as well as the parking Mette was alble to stay longer in with her car. For the spiders, they are here as I live on the water but twice a year I have a guy, the spyderman, spraying  biological spray but still there van be some around. I do not mind so much as they eat all kinds of other insects which will be the problem if you do kill all the spiders with toxics that are extremely harmful to all environment. So i hope future guests understand the dilemma. Thank you for your comment. I will change it and get a new matras. Best is to let me know right away if there are any complaints! I am very sorry to hear this comment afterwarts. As it was an exeptional hot day the temperature was quite high but it is possible to open other windows as well. The other problems were not mentioned to me during their stay.  I am sorry for your disappointment. The things you have problems with are clearly noted in the add, there is no tv and it is a studio. You are the first to be so dissappointed! I am sorry to hear this afterwarts. I cannot help you find the lights if you do not mention this.  Well, i think the communication could have been better. I have seen Marylin about four times in three days. There was plenty of time to ask information about shops that are open and close by. About the coffee machine or where the soaps are (under the sink in the bathroom). Its difficult for me to deal with any problems if i am not told.  The check in was not done properly as Marylins check in time was not mentioned after mailing sms email through air bnb and even voice mails. So i was very surprised to se them at 10 pm. She replied on a sms from airbnb saying there is a message but that does not come into my account.  So i helped them out strait away, storing there luggage and gave them a key. After this they were out and did not mention any problems also not when i saw them later on face to face and asked them if they foun everything i got a reply. ""Yes we found the champaine bottles"". I thought it was a joke and everything was oke. If they spoke their mind on the things they missed or were no as they expected i could have make their stay much nicer. Unfortunatly it did not come to this. "

Shawn and Drew are amazing people and it was just a pleasure to welcome them into my home! Sorry that I forgot to write a review and you are welcome back here anytime.  Dear Victoria,<br/>I apologise for any inconveniences during your stay.<br/>However some elements of your in need of rectification. <br/>1 The combi-oven you used was in good shape before you used it. And has a wonky start button now. How long this will last is unclear, but the machine has to be replaced very soon. The 6,- for the button does not cover the replacement of the device. And initially I was obviously annoyed, because I wanted and always help the guests use the devices to prevent unnecessary breakage. <br/>2. And with regards to the windows I want to say that they can be a little sticky but of course you can open the windows in your room. I apologize the groundfloor wasn‚Äôt organized well enough. We are currently doing a lot of maintenance at the house. And it‚Äôs possible that it causes extra clutter. I‚Äôm sorry your stay was disappointing. All the best,<br/>Reinout Dear Anteo,<br/>thanks for the advice and  I‚Äôll do my best to improve everyone‚Äôs stay. With regard to the bikes I have to say that it‚Äôs 5,- per bike per day and not 10,-. <br/>Enjoy Amsterdam! <br/>With best regards,<br/>Reinout Dear Patrick,<br/>I‚Äôm very sorry to hear that you thought the offer was unclear. I‚Äôve just read the description of the property again to ascertain that I have mentioned the location of the bathroom and the fact that it‚Äôs shared. Yet again I‚Äôm sorry to hear you were disappointed. I wish you all the best.<br/>Reinout Dear Deborah it's unfortunate that you think that the water is left for days. I can tell you it isn't. In fact it gets refreshed everyday. And the linnen in the room are clean. It's unfortunate that I currently haven't got the space to store it well at the moment. I can tell you that a solution is in the pipeline. I'm deeply sorry if I offended you in any way during your stay or earlier. I wish you all the best. Thank you so much Michael. You are a wonderful guy and a were a great guest. You are welcome back anytime."

20644650,"HI anne, it was great hosting you and you were fantastic guests Although I believe that Jonathan and his group are a great bunch of lads, they unfortunately didn't leave the place as one might expect. The place looked like a bomb exploded. Nothing to really worry about as the cleaning lady could clean it up but it took some time.<br/>It is unfortunate that Jonathan continued to accuse our cleaning lady of breaking glasses whereas the law of probability makes it more likely that it was them. Again, no real big issue as far as we are concerned.<br/>On the other points, it seems rather pointless to react as tit for tats lead to nothing,<br/>As we said, they were a good bunch of lads but maybe got carried away a bit with the excitement of 8 lads on a weekend out in Amsterdam Hi maler,<br/><br/>thanks for staying over. You were great guests.<br/><br/>Richard and Myrthe"
20660883,"Thank you for your feedback. I will take care of the fact that there was not enough space for the clothes. About  the water.. You had a bit of bad luck. Sorry for that. Normally there a ""cooker"" that gives boiled water right away when you open the crane. Unfortunately  that was broken when you were here, like i explained.  Meanwhile the cooker is fixed. About the cats, that information √≠s on my site, so that shouldn't be a surprise.  Anyway, thank you for choosing my room."

20791600,"we are very shocked about your review. we checked you in 30 minutes earlier than the normal check-in time. The host stayed there so that you could also walk into the garden and were looking for the key. in addition, we asked nicely if everything was satisfactory after the first night, you did not respond and did not give us the opportunity to help you with one of our services. This is not very fair of you. And when you left you wrote this message to us: Hello! Yes, everything has been great. Thank you so much and we fed the cat and gave him hugs :). apparently this was not the case and you have not been honest with us. we are very sorry."

One as described by Holly, and one on the third floor, next to the living room. In case you lilke to use that one, it means you have to take the internal stairs.<br/>I'm happy you appreciate the dryer. I don't use it myself : ).   Hi Elisa, my apologies for the wifi not working your entire stay. I can imagine how inconvenient that is. Got it fixed now (mandatory password reset).   Hi Ruby, thank you for your great review. I'm very happy to read it, and that you enjoyed it! I just got new mattrasses, funny that you commend on that one as well.  Cheers! Remco Hi Ole, thank you for your nice review.

Best wishes for the new year. Cheers, Remco<br/>  Hi Helena, You were an excellent guest. I am afraid you had the worst weekend. Even at Christmas people were having lunch outside, on the terraces.

Sorry, I changed the names of the quests. Elena and her friend were great quests. Clean, quiet, friendly and independant. Great guest and was a pleasure to deal with.    highly recommend! Thx Birgitte for you're lovely review. When we ever come close to Ribe I let you know x thx for the chocolate:)) Oh Chee-Meng, I also had a cold shower, I'am so sorry. Problem with the boiler but is fixed now:)) Thx you so much, Julia for your awesome review! Thx Felix, hopefully next time nice weather Thank you so much, Jackie "

21010247,"Thank you my happy family.<br/>Always welcome Hi Theodoros, thank you for your nice review. . I'm glad I had the chance to explain well in advance what a B&B is and where you could find that information in my listing. Since I have my own separate part of the apartment, we didn‚Äôt see much of each other, but the times we did meet were really pleasant. I wish you just as much joy on your future travels as you had during your stay here dank voor je review. Tot een andere keer Hi Demi, it was truly nice to host you all. See you next time i hope Hi Marius, thank you for your review. I wish you all the best. See you next time in Amsterdam It was an honour to host you and your family. I wish all of you the best and thank you for your nice words. Please give my special regards to your son Hi Laila, it was great to host you. thank you so much for your kind words Jullie zijn een hele leuke groep vriendinnen die altijd welkom zijn Dank Bert, al het beste voor de toekomst Hi, thank you again for your visit and the laughter. When i go to China i let you know. Enjoy the rest of your trip Hi Shayan, it was great to meet you all. Thanks for staying and the small talks. Have a great New Year (i know i'm early) and hopefully i see you all again Hi Ali, you are always welcome. I enjoyed your stay very much. Please give my regards to your friends. And tell your friend he is welcome to visit me on my film sets.<br/>Have a great Christmas! What a great well travelled  family you are. Thanks for staying and keep traveling! Hope to see you again Thanks for the time we spent together. i'm sorry you where a little bit disappointed about the toilet that was not directly in the room. i will definitely visit you when i'm in the area. Always welcome to come back. If you come back to Amsterdam i found new places to go for dinner and lunches, see you next time thanks for your review, the apartment is indeed  more in a hip area from Amsterdam than a very busy area. Luckily the metro stops 3 minutes away. See you next time when you are in Amsterdam Thank you and see you in the Philippines Thank you for your review and the valuation you gave my apartment. I ask myself if the low rating you gave me has anything to do with the fact that I caught you with 6 boys of 18 (you booked under your mothers name) instead of 4 and the big quantity of bottles of whiskey and everything more you carried with you got me thinking that you wanted to do a lot more with my apartment then only enjoy the sleeping facility. A tip: next time be honest and  read the add of  the facility so you know if it is to your liking. Hi Katharina, I just found the cookies you gave me. Wow thank you so much!! They are delicious.<br/><br/>I really hope to see you again. What I said before: you are an amazing nice funny good to talk with group of friends and yo ae truly welcome any time!!!<br/><br/>Again thank you Thanks for the nice words. It was really a pleasure to have you all as guests. it felt very natural that you where here. <br/><br/>Hope to see you again! Dear Kathryn and friends , I would host you anytime. Thank you so much for your nice words. The pleasure was all mine. thank you for being my guests, you all where so relaxed. it felt really like friends game to visit, thank you for that. You where a great nice funny group. I wish you all the best I would be glad if you did. Amazing that 259 super hosts reviews saw it so differently. Thank you for being my guests,  I'm sorry that you did not find the Metro stop nearby the house from where you are in 4 minutes in the Center.i really ope to see you all again I thank you all for the nice time you gave me. Thank you Mary Alice that you took the time to write me a review.  I strongly feel the urge to react.  I found out that people who have not so much experience with Air bnb sometimes don't really understand the principal of the difference between a private room and the whole apartment while it is clearly stated on the Air BNB site.. If you look on the Airbnb site under  the section Private room and book a room. You get a Private room, and not a whole apartment for yourself.  I tried to explain that to you many times but you did not understood that. I really have no idea at all why you write that there where  only 2 queensize beds? You and you group slept on 4 beds. When you left and  the cleaning team came in there where 4 slept beds in the room, I saw it with my own eyes.  Could it be that you where still a little bit angry at me, while you where writing the review,  for that I did not leave the apartment so you would have the whole apartment for yourself?   If you ever book on Air bnb again please read carefully what you book. It is not nice for you or the host when you book something with the wrong expectation. I thank you and your group for being my guests. I really hope that we will see each other again. Thank you guys for your positive energy. Thanks for enjoying yourself so much All the best Ben, It was great to see how you liked the garden I'am glad that you  where so happy with the bikes. Truly hope to see you again Haha ""For the one and only!"" Friends thank you for all. I truly hope to see you all again somewhere. Enjoy travelling, shooting, horseback driving, drones and life! Hi Susanna, it was truly fun to have you all as my guests. I wish you all the best. And really hope to see you again Hope to see you again Thanks for being my guests and maybe I see you in the future as a group of 6. I can imagine that if you don't read the add properly and don't read  all the correspondence send by me about your booked private room that you are surprised that, when you get here,  you found out that you ""just"" booked a private room instead of a whole apartment I can imagine that that  is disappointing. So disappointing that you immediately left. I am surprised that you could write a review because you didn't sleep here at all.  If I may give you an advice; please read the add and correspondence more carefully this to avoid disappointment Enjoy the rest of your trip. I really hope to see you all again I'm very pleased to have met you all. I wish you lots of fun on your journey. You are always welcome Thank you very much for being so nice Thank you for your positive energy You where all fantastic! Thank you all for your nice positive vibe. Thanks guys for being my guests, looking forward to next time. thank you for being my guests, I hope your further trip is very nice Thanks for being my guests. I hope to see you again Have a nice time in the rest of Europe Thank you very much for your kindness.

Thank you all  for your great energy and vibe!  lieverd and I wish you much fun on the rest of your journey and we truly hope to see you again. Thank you Eva, glad to be of assistance. I knew upfront that you would give me a bad review. First you thought you rented the whole apartment.  Which is even not possible. Then a fifth  person of your group came in later while you booked the room for four persons. You did not liked it when he couldn't sleep here. As far as the room is concerned, the photos of the room are made by AIR BNB themselves so you can clearly see the bathing space and the measurement of the room, which is also clearly stated in the add.  The room and garden where cleaned,  like always,  by the cleaning team. In te description and the mails exchange  is exactly stated how far the city centre is. I wonder why didn't you mention any of your grieves during your stay? A tip for next time when you book read the add more carefully.  Danke, danke Thank you Ksenia, very nice to read  that you felt so fine and save in my house. Your whole group had a very positive vibe around them thanks for bringing that to us. Greetings from Lieverd. We hope you have a safe flight back.  Thanks for being my guests,  It is recommendable to see: "" Avengers Infinity war"" on the biggest screen there is. The names of the stones are: Space Stone, Mind Stone, Reality Stone, Power Stone, Time Stone en Soul Stone. Or the infinity stones. Like the title. By the way I do have 4 beds, so I always ask upfront how many beds a group once to have. Standard I make up 2 queenside beds. ENJOY the film I am sure you will. Thanks guys for being my guests. Have a great tour! Hai Eliza, we would love to see you guys back. Have a great time in the Big Apple Thank you, the honour was all mine Hai Jodi, thanks again for the present they where delicious, and Lieverd and I hope to see you again We both liked it also very much, Thanks for being my guests. I hope London is great. See you at the next Rolling Stones concert Great guests! Thank you I really hope to see you guys again. Enjoy the rest of Europe! I feel I have family in Berlin now.

It was all Lieverds and mine pleasure Thank you for being my guests, succes with your sports career Powerrrrrrr woman, thank you so much for being you Hai Nicolas, Thanks for being my guest. All the best  Hai Felipe,<br/>Thanks for the nice words. It was a pleasure to host you and your friends It felt really normal that you where here.  Success with your new house and like I said if you need anything call me. Happy Christmas! Thanks that you where my guest  Thank you for being you guys Thank you Melissandre for your nice  feedback. I am sorry that you found the room a bit expensive and that you didn't saw the key of the door.  I found out that people who have not so much experience with Air bnb sometimes don't really understand the principal. The concept is that you choose for not to go to a hotel but to stay in a local apartment, with al the benefits. And yes a house is different then a hotel room, that is part of the fun if you are into it. That's why I always ask up front if you have any questions about the room or the location and do I send an extended description of the location. Thank you for being my guest and you are always welcome  Tnx for being my guest Jennifer thanks for being you Hai Yik,<br/><br/>Thank you for being my guests. I hope everything goes well with your study Thanks guys Thank you for being my guest! What a pleasure it was to be your host again. What a very positive funny nice energy you all have. I wish you all well, next time we will do a lot better with the football Thanks guys and girl for being my guests thanks for our talks thank you guys for being my guests. I truly enjoyed your presence<br/> Hai Jacqueline, thanks for being my guest, Air bnb houses are in a residential area. Thanks for our chats and your positive energy. Succes with everything! Thank you very much for being my guests, it is so nice that you also sing lullabies now. It really helps when you go to the veterinarian. i always sing there for Lieverd. It was great to see that yo love your dog so much. And you and your better half are a very warm, positive lovely couple, with great energy around you. I hope that you pass your exams.<br/><br/>Lieverd and i truly hope to hear you sing your lullabies. one day All the best, you all are always welcome here Keep up the good work! Thank you for being our guests We had great fun in hosting you guys. Lieverd and i wish you all the best.  Thank you for being my guests. I hope your son liked the VU Hai Bruno, thanks for being my guests, the garden even became much more beautiful after you went away. I hope to see you again Thanks for being my guests it felt very nice. I had to laugh very much when i saw your present for me. Thank you for your review, maybe you forgot that there is a big roll-up room screen which you can put around the shower to make it a private shower, and if you bring such an enormous amount of luggage, as you guys did but off course needed when going out and looking very good every night, then i can imagine... <br/>i hope lieverd and i may welcome you again<br/><br/> Hai Ben, Thanks for being my guest Thank you  Thank you for being my guests Thank you for being such a very friendly, warm, funny guest Pleasure was al mine.  Succes in Australia! Give my regards to your father and friend. Thank you hai Milena, your welcome anytime. I hope your hardwork pays of Hai Apollo, <br/>Wow thank you very much, we are glad that you enjoyed your stay. <br/>we hope that the fair was a succes<br/> Thnx for being our guests. It was fun i absolutely welcome you with open arms Thanks for your effort to write a review.<br/><br/>We are sorry that you did not read the ad more carefully. The room is exactly as described in the ad. The photos, professional done by Air bnb, also clearly show how the room looks like. <br/>Like we suggested if one or more people need privacy one can use the garden or living room. No problem, or use the wall to wall room screen in the room.<br/><br/>All in all if you book the next  time at Air bnb read the advertisement well and look at the pictures and then if you have any questions don't hesitate to ask them before you book.  <br/> It was a pleasure having you Audrey and her group where super okay. they liked Amsterdam and that is always nice to see. Very friendly people. It was a real pleasure to host them Net, nice very friendly group of people and also very hard workers I could see that Joe's group where enjoying themselves. I always like it when people feel like home at my place, they did. They where very pleasant and net. I can recommend them to all very nice group to have. I would recommend them to everyone Hi Foo. i enjoyed your stay. You were a very net and pleasant group. luckily the bag with Christmas stuff ws not yours . I am sure the other Air BnB places you guys go to are just as happy with you as i was. All the best  Hi Mark it was very nice to meet you.

21124767,"Dear Kyra, I am really sorry to hear this and read this, the more because Wieky, them women who explained you the house, asked many times if everything was ok and she only got smiley faces that all was so nice. So, I am a little surprised. The more, reading that it is better a house for 2 persons.....this sounds spoiled to me. In Amsterdam, our house is really big house (groundfloor and cellar, the 2 etages you used) and mostly families with 4 children or more do live in such houses. I am quite flabberguested.<br/>And that upstairs there is our theatre-equipment, mostly people do appreciate that.....the more because you were informed about it and did not have problems ounce you were there. All the people of our company (3 moments) who were there, ringed your bell first. Also about that you were informed. <br/>I am really sorry to read this all, because we did our very best to leave a clean and comfortable house and of course we want our guests to be happy. <br/>Friendly regards, Judith John and his friends were great guests to have. Quiet people, good taking care of our house and cats and very reliable persons. I can really recommend them to have them as guests! Gary's wife and friend were great guests. Left the house clean, good communication and took very good care of our cats! I can only reccomend them :)."
21167882,"Thank you, Charlotte! I would love to see you again. Best regards. Makes me feel great to read this amazing feedback Carla! Thank you for taking this time to write this for me (and future guests!). Hi Isobel,<br/>Thank you so much for taking your time submitting me a a review! I am sorry to see such a bad rating and read about such a negative experience! I would like to respond on every aspect you mentioned. First of all, I am sorry about the confusion regarding the bedrooms. I do indeed have in my advertisement ""Guests are invited to enjoy the whole Basement"" but you are absolutely right about this in need for further clarification. You did tell me during your stay that you are surprised about the arrangement, but you also said ""We are ok now and we are enjoying the place"", so I believed this was not an issue for you.<br/> I am sure that there was a miscommunication regarding the extra keys, since I always provide only 1 set. I have 2 sets of keys in total and the second set is in the possession of the property management company for emergencies. I never ask money for extra key, since I do not have an extra key.<br/>I regret to hear that you were disappointed not having extra blankets. I am afraid I don't remember that you asked for extra blankets against the cold. You did ask for extra linen upon arrival, because you did not want to sleep together with your travel mates on the two double beds. The agent at the management company told you that she would gladly send you extra linen. It comes with a fee of 20 euros, because delivering something extra counts as an extra service, since the beds were already made according to the advertisement (2 double beds with double linen). You turned down this service and agreed to just share the beds. I am sorry if I did not quite catch that you needed extra blankets against the cold. As I understand, the biggest issue during your stay was the heating not working. I advised you to adjust the heat by turning the heaters open and adjusting the thermostat. I am sorry you were not able to find these and I regret to hear that your calls did not went through when you wanted to notify the management company about this issue. Your calls did go through on the first day, so I am not sure why it did not work later on. I am sure that the management company would have sent someone as soon as they hear that you cannot find the thermostat. They wouldn't have waited for 5 days to leave you in a cold apartment. I am wondering what went wrong there, but please know it was not my intention to cause any troubles during your stay. I am sure I never told you heat is not mandatory in the apartments! This is absolutely not true and I wish I would have known about this issue with the heating to help you sort it out! I was excited to host you, that is why I also offered you a discount when you wanted to book my apartment! I am sorry that it did not help making the experience any better! <br/>Best Great to hear you will come back. Hope to see you soon Erwan! Thanks Mogens! It has windows though, so it is light and yes as a B&B it cannot have a kitchen, but it does have a fridge and coffeemachine ;) Hope to see you again! Thank you so much Mariana! This makes me so happy! Aww, thanks Ricky!  Indeed never a problem! Definitely come again Joshua! No one will ever enter your part of the house, so it is safe, no worries! Great to hear you liked it so much! Thanks Ellie! And yes it does state that it is a basement apartment, but good for pointing it out. Glad you liked the garden so much ;) Thank you so much Mark! Makes me so happy to read this :) I was happy to have host you and you are welcome any time! Great to hear Daigo! Thanks ;) Thanks Sivan for your review!  Thanks Eddie! Hi Aislinn, thanks for your sweet review! It is always great to hear such nice words! And thanks for the feedback, I will make sure to take a look at the bed ;) Hope to see you again in the future! I would like to apologise again for the inconvenience caused by apartment not being ready for you in time.<br/>I rely on a cleaning company to prepare the accommodation and always provide them with arrival time of the guest. I was promised this won‚Äôt happen again.<br/>As for the steep stairs, this is very common in central Amsterdam as buildings were designed that way in the past and now many of them are listed, meaning no structural changes can't be made. <br/>I would like to thank you for the feedback, I have taken steps to make sure cleaners make it to the apartment on time.<br/><br/>Best,<br/>Pauline"

21371721,"Thank you so much for your kind words and happy to hear you want to come back ;) always welcome Thanks you so much for your great review and kind words ! Hope to see you again here Jerry Thanks you very much Andreas, great to hear and it was nice to meet you! Maybe we meet again. Cheers Sander Thanks a lot for your nice words and enthusiasm Dank voor jouw feedback, ik had moeten vragen of je 1 enkele of 2 dekens had gewenst, want heb uiteraard beide beschikbaar. Goede tip Thank you for staying in my place and for being so respectful! Highly recommended  Thanks Heather, it's appreciated!  The whole idea of Airbnb is that you host people in your own house, so yes, that's the place where I live, so where I keep my personal belongings. <br/>The price you pay, has no influence on the fact if something feels like a home or not... Well at least not in my world. Besides, if you don't know how to use a thermostat, putting it on 29 degrees Celsius, then I really don't know where to start. <br/>Guests didn't feel what all the others have felt so far, it can happen and the only advise I have: book a 3star hotel next time for the same price and that unpersonal feeling you get included. Yes the pictures look different with bad weather, because that's the only thing which was unaccarate ... But you get what you deserve  Thank you for your honest summary. It was a great pleasure having you two and whenever you come back, my door is open. My place was as clean as I delivered it. Thanks for the respect and guests like you are the reason to continue...

I also provided some brochure and some city maps of Amsterdam. I was just for only 2 weeks on the airbnb site, so I was not really prepared. Many thanks Enith and Evan Beste Marcel, dank voor je lieve reactie. Ik vond het fijn jullie te mogen begroeten. Jullie waren super relaxte gasten. Dank voor je feedback.

Thank you and come back anytime Por circumstancias ajenas a mi voluntad el cuarto que initialmente alquilo la se√±ora estaba ocupado.

21689300,"Hi Ma√´va. I feel bad for you that the weekend didn‚Äôt unfolded the way you had in mind.  <br/>I do think it is sad that you gave me such a bad review because I explained multiple times what happend and you clearly didn‚Äôt read my advertisement. <br/>Anyway, all the best in life üôèüèº"
21725610,"Thank you Wallace, for letting me know! I have ordered new mattresses! THank you for staying, Hadewych I was of course very sorry to read this comment! Alexander unfortunately didnt contact us about it, so there is no way for me to check now what was wrong. I only know that guests who stayed in the boat after Alexander didnt experience any smells or problems and were happy with their stay. "
21845977,"I am always a bit surprised if guests complain about not having a kitchen..its clear in the add. So is the location and the steep stairs. Nothing I can change about it. Hi,<br/>I live in the same building and if guests want to meet me in person I am happy to do so. Mostly guests  have there own agenda and I try not to interfare. <br/>Some spidercobs are fine( they eat the muskitoos), but I try to clean them. <br/>Dont understand why you are so negative. Amsterdam is expensive but this studio is  a good place to be. larger then hotel rooms and a nice view at a big garden with a big tube. Sorry for th noise of the neighbour above you. He was working on his floor and moved furniture. I did not know that.<br/>He caused also the leakings. Very unfortunally... Hoi Steven,<br/>Yes,I had to do some  work at the house while you stayed.. But did it after noon during daytime, hoping not to disturb guests. excuses for the inconfinience. Mostly I react within a hour on mail( perhaps not at 07.00 hr in the morning.....)<br/>By telephone I am always standby!!! Adrian did smoke in the doorway of the stairs  what set the fire alarm .<br/>When we discused it h√© did not denied <br/>There is a no smoking policy in the building and I have fire alarms .<br/>I believe the neighbor that h√© smelt marihuana , because I say it in the eyes of Adrian also and h√© confessed at the moment.<br/>He did not smoked insite the room but in the doorway doorstairs because of the Rain.<br/>it was mot very polite of my neighbor to shout, but guests have to underdtand they stay in a building with neighbors and not in a hotel. And fire in old wooden buildings is very dangerous.<br/>This is also very bad for my listing, if neighbors <br/>conplain about a airbnb guest.<br/>I was very politie in the ranking of Adrian  and did not sent him away, <br/>I could have done that . Dear Maria,<br/>I had the room ready for you very early because you ask for it. And then you arrived  very late without letting me know.<br/>So I dont understand your low rating for arrival.<br/>The same with check out.<br/>You left the room almost a hour too late.<br/>Communication was a bit difficult in person because of the spanish ,but the airbnb app can translate.... What a shweet review you gave!!! Happy to hear that you enjoyed Amsterdam.<br/>All the best <br/>Debby Hi Marie-Helene,<br/>What a pitty that you did not told me that you could not work the watercoocker...<br/>There is no microwave in the room because the regulations for touristic rent in Amsterdam forbit a kitchenet.<br/> My advertisement on the platform of airbnb does not mention a microwave and mentions the steep stairs.<br/>Hopefully you had a good time in Amsterdam and the travel with the Thalys was quickly.<br/>All the best,<br/>Debby Thanks for the feedback Katharina. Time for a new matras then. To late for you, but I will get a dubble matras then. Not nice to roll into the middle! Hi Stef,<br/>Thanks for the feed back about the parking place.<br/>I have this listing already a few years on airbnb and I seldom look at my own advertising.<br/>Airbnb updates and renews the functions you can use a lot. And I saw that I did ot filled i a new list they put at the advertisement and so automaticly stand for free parking...<br/>I change it...thans for letting me know. This has to be correct ofcourse.<br/>You are welcome anytime,<br/>Debby Thanks again, hope you found what you looked for in Amsterdam Jammer dat het bed te zacht was voor jullie, heb juist een stevige boxspring gehaald....excuses ook voor misschien een te emotionele check in...vond het bjzonder  je te kunnen hosten met een wederzijdse geschiedenis ....je bent een mooi mens uit je ogen te lezen en  ben terug gezet in te tijd dat mijn familie nog compleet was....voelde ff mij twentse roots weer....fijn en pijn Thx, for the feedback.<br/>Normally I provide the code to guests, just was a bit busy that day.... Hi Jennifer,<br/><br/>Yes the stairs are steep and original, and I do mention it in my  advertisement in the second line.....But I can understand that you are not use to it . <br/>Best wishes,<br/>Debby Hi Ara,<br/><br/>I'm glad you enjoyed your stay !The stairs are typical ""Amsterdam stairs"" they can be difficult with big suitcases but i can always help. The neighbours a few houses away where busy making a new window in the morning,I'm sorry this was inconvieniant for you. Dont worry if u want to come back in wintertime the central heating works perfect then and we also have dubbel glass windows, never had a complaint about the wintercold. <br/><br/>Best wishes and thank you for staying,<br/><br/>Debby  Hi Amber,<br/>Sorry I could not give you the service of dropping your luggage before check in time..you know I was for the weekend in belgium and my car broke down,<br/>Anyway your room was ready in time as promissed and I mailed you about this the day before...Sorry to have stirred up your planning. <br/>Best wishes,<br/>Debby Yes the stairs are steep, there for I mentioned it in my advertisement. All the towels are white and sometimes old stains are difficult to romove or see.<br/>So sorry for that .I will pay extra attention to them ! Hi,<br/>I am sorry to hear that you where bitten  by muskitos.<br/>Normally there are not many for there is no canal or water around....<br/>But thanks for the feed back, I will think about a solution in the future!<br/>Best wishes,<br/><br/>Debby Hi Sohia,<br/>I really did not saw you outside!!!<br/>I am very sorry for you, because it was poring ....<br/>I was cleaning the room upstairs and dont hear the doorbell then.<br/>You could check in at 11.30 .<br/>2,5 hours earlier then normal( 14.00hr) and I was rushing cleaning your room !!<br/>Hope you could appreciate the early check in anyway.<br/>Best wishes,<br/>Debby Ende August sind die nachbarn fertig mit bauen, meine entschuldigung fur den L√°rm die sie manchmal machen mussen....<br/>And danke fur den ""Feed back ""! Hoi Wouter,<br/>Dank voor je feedback.<br/>De entree moest inderdaad gezogen worden omdat er net nieuw glas gezet was in mijn winkelkdeur ,excuses ! Beste Tamara,<br/>Excuses voor mijn verwarring over jullie aankomst tijd...heb inderdaad daardoor de studio heel snel moeten schoonmaken hierdoor zaken over het hoofd gezien..<br/>Vervelend voor jullie..sorry.<br/>Er zijn twee soorten kussens op het bed , een zachte en een stevige. Hoop dat hierdoor juist wel keus was ...<br/>Jammer dat jullie slecht hebben geslapen, de meeste mensen vinden het bed en de rust s nachts juist fantastisch.<br/>Kom gerust een keertje terug, dan zorg ik voor nog een extra optie qua kussen en maken we een prijsje.<br/>Met groet,<br/>Debby<br/> Hoi Wiert,<br/>Wat jammer, dan hebben jullie het verkeerd begrepen....<br/>Op de kopietjes aan de wand staat het ook""ontbijt op het Bellaymyplein en Bilderdijkkade en diner juist in de Jan Pieter Heijestraat.... Thanks Alicia for your feedback ! Hi Niels,<br/>Hope you had a good trip.<br/>The coffeemachine was fine.....I checked it..Its a pitty you did not told me the first day so I could explain it to you.<br/>The Nespresso by the way is Swiss. Hi Robert,<br/>Thanks for your suggestion.<br/>The stairs ( 15 steps) to the first floor are indeed a little steep, but for it is an authentic situation, nothing can been done to it.<br/>For elderly people who have difficulties with their legs it can be indeed a problem.<br/>Anyway, I am always glad to help with the luggages and most of my guests get used to it.<br/>A second handrail is not a solution I think.<br/>I will adjust the discription on airbnb.<br/> Hi Christine,<br/>This was the first time I  did not checked in my self because I was for a short break in France.<br/>My friend Ellen was there to check you in and waited a long time for you.<br/>I am sorry you could not reach her...I send you the phonenumber and had told you that I was not inreach.<br/>You also had the adres and Ellen was there waiting for you!<br/>Hope you had a good time anyway and I am sorry that the check in felt a little unconfenient for you..<br/><br/>Best regards,<br/>Debby<br/><br/><br/> Thanks Donald for the feedback!<br/>I shall adjust the timer of the lights.<br/>The stairs are steep in this kind of old Amsterdam houses, thats true .And I can imagine that you had trouble with your luggage because it was extremely heavy and much !<br/>Thats why I carried your luggage up for you....<br/><br/>Hope you had a nice holiday in Europe and thanks again.<br/> Thx Lexi for your visit and your kind words.<br/>You are welcome anytime !!! Thx Carlos !! Thanks Mun,<br/><br/>Hope you have a nice memory of Amsterdam.<br/>You are very welcome to stay again !<br/>Good luck with the studies for both of you ! Thanks for the review.You are very welcome to stay again and your little girl was no problem at all !!<br/>Take care. Dank je Sytze,<br/><br/>En dank voor je geduld !<br/>Je weet me te vinden !!!<br/>Misschien in de zomer een bbq of houtvuur in de tuin ?<br/><br/>Groet, Debby The chocolate you left where very nice...!!!!<br/>Hope you had a nice trip in europe.<br/>Best wishes,<br/>Debby Dear Amanda,<br/>Thank you for your wunderfull review !<br/>I am glad you had a good time, even for this short time you visit Amsterdam.<br/>Take care,<br/><br/>Debby"
21849097,"Nogmaals dank voor je verblijf en je tip! Groet, Coen Great review, Jennifer. Thanks again! Thank you for the wonderful compliments! You're very welcome to staying with us in the future.

Thanks, Jean, for your great review and good tips!"
21866990,"Wat fijn  om te lezen dat je het naar je zin hebt gehad. Amsterdam Noord is heel leuk , vooral als je een fiets hebt. Het was heel gezellig en vertrouwd om je over de vloer te hebben. Succes met je bedrijf. Hey Vladimir wat ontzettend mooi wat en hoe je geschreven hebt. Dank je wel en het was veel te kort. Heb een goede ontdekkingsreis ü§ó Hoi Leonardo dat van de locatie staat erbij. En ons huis ligt in noord en op deze locatie wel bij heel veel voorzieningen. <br/>Je kan en mag het niet vergelijken met de historische binnenstad. <br/>Daar zijn de kamers en de prijzen ook vele malen hoger. <br/>De binnenstad overigens met de fiets heel dichtbij ligt. Je had beter een fiets kunnen huren want met 10 min sta je achter het Centraal Station. Lieve Sara ik vond het ook echt heel bijzonder en enorm leuk. Je voelde ook als familie , realiseerde ik me nadat je op trein was gestapt. <br/>Soms brengt het leven oude zielen weer bij elkaar. <br/>Heb het goed en ik ben trots op de haven die je bouwt in Marocco. <br/>Mensen zoals jij heeft deze wereld hard nodig. Blijf jezelf en wees sterk. <br/>Liefs. B Dear Petra thats nice what you share . I didnt know it was your first trio alone. And all guests ( persons) are welcome. <br/>I found two of the same glasses so that is also solved ;-) Hey Haylee ,  ja ik had ook wel langer willen kletsen met je. En je meer leren kennen of ook mijn theater laten zien. <br/>Tot volgende keer misschien ? Roken in huis is niet te gestaan dus ook niet op het terras. Wat overigens geen onderdeel is van de kamer. <br/>Water goed idee! Hoewel in NL alle kraanwater goed is . Super op je gemak voelen is het meest belangrijke in deze tijd. You are more then welcome! Dear Julie thank you for your positive feedback. <br/>üôè Hoi Nele wat jammer dat je niet even hebt laten weten over je vragen van het openbaarvervoer. Er gaat een bus direct naar de metro . En de metro brengt je in 5 minuten naar het centraal station. Het is allemaal dichtbij en op loopafstand. <br/>De deur is toegankelijk maar je  bent bij ons thuis en kan ook zo onze kamer en woonkamer inlopen. <br/>Airbnb is opgericht om locale mensen te leren kennen en bij hun thuis te verblijven.  Wantrouwen past niet bij dit concept. Dear Bhavika I am happy you had a good time üôè Thank you and nice you came to visit us . I will  out one always. It became warm all of a sudden. Dank je wel üòÄ Unfortunatly i cannot read your language.<br/>Have a good and save travel. Mohsen reserved for a friend. He had a good stay and was a pleasant guest. He went to enjoy in Amsterdam and was a kind person to have met. I am sorry to read you were not satisfied. Next time please tell me and I will try to help you. Hi Justina its quiet unfair you blame your own problems to my place<br/>Nobody ever couldnt find it. <br/>And please dont use drugs when you come to my place. Its how people get lost. And my son doesnt have to pick you out of the park in the evening. <br/>Or demand something through an app as if i am your servant. I was downstairs and you could easaly communicate with me. <br/>I guess you better take a hotel next time in touristic centre of my city. Hey the sharing of the bathroom is in my discription. Dear Ciara, I took contact with Airbnb again about the whole issue with you two. And when we cleaned the room I found more garbage related to the use of drugs. I have no clue why you had to take 3 bathmats into your bed and a bunch of clean towels? Which where not used nor needed. When cleaning up the room I found more things and the rolling curtain is damaged and ruptured. So for me it says it all. <br/>You told me every day you had problems sleeping and put layers of makeup on your face to hide it. Before going to the park at 8th in the morning to smoke the first joint together.  <br/>Again even if it is allowed in my country and nice to try out, it doesn't mean you have to be knocked out and a zombie.To be on it 24/7 the 3 days you visit my home. We have hostels for that that host the general drunk and drugtourist from Great Britain.<br/> <br/>We Dutch drink wine, but very drunk people get a fine in the street, we have a redlight district but people don't rape each other here and yes, you can try marahuana, but it doesn't mean you have to be on it 24/ 7 and knocked out. Impossible to talks to and unpredictable in the behavior and communicaiton. You two didn't look good, ill even. You partner was rude in his communications and both wore sunglasses al the time to hide your eyes because of the drugs. <br/>And I advise you to think about that before you visit a person home through RBNB.  <br/> Because your presence didn't feel save at all. <br/><br/>Last thing: the loft in the room with the bed is advertised. Nobody ever complained about it as they probably took a good look at the advertisement. Clean sheets are enough. But nobody every took a bunch of sheets out of the wardrobe in the middle of the night and left all open and dropped on the floor. And the distance to the central station is 7 minutes by underground and 15 minutes by bike. I can imagine that for a very stoned person it feels very far.  Most guests rent a bike and enjoy to ride to the centre and the surrounding green area. And they visit musea or friends . Hey Zoe, I am surprised by the negative way you write about your stay. And if I read the text I assume you couldn't read the facial expression well of me as a host. You were more than welcome and I just asked you to inform me about the washing-machine. As you used it without even asking how it works.  The room was clean, it was not even hot in the Netherlands when you were here and most people love the art work in the place.     Indeed our place it not for people that want to party,  then its better to take an anonymous hotelroom in the centre of town or rent a good bike. But the time to the city centre is really 7 minutes by metro and 20 minutes by bike. Hey Carlos nice to hear from you. My son was also very delighted with your stay and tour :-) Hi olivia, <br/>I understand your reflection.<br/>But in my online text is written that you stay in our home and that we appreciate it if guests can take in account that we also sleep. And therefor decide not to shower elaboratly at midnight.<br/>Its a matter of  a personal attitude.<br/>You both showered at 00:30 .<br/>Which is a moment me and my kid sleep beside the shared bathroom.<br/>If you want free nightly showers then dont sleep with the locals but in a hotel.<br/>And  the other point ; our house is in Amsterdam North. Which is not in the  antique centre.<br/>Luckely we have a metroline near the house which brings you in 7 minutes to the central station.<br/>But our area is a resident area. Thats why its green, quiet and far more cheaper :-) <br/>You both made the choice to come to Amsterdam North and stay in a family home. <br/>It was nice to host you and hopefully next time you respect with whom you stay. Dear Lucca, I would like to respond to your feedback. <br/>The space you refer to as being ' small 'is not a room but a loft with two floors in it and measures 25 m2 surface [ + the sleeping floor.]   It is situated at  the whole 2nd floor of the house itself. We say the upper floor of the house. <br/>I don't know how big other rooms were that you have visited, but for Amsterdam is is very large. <br/><br/>Secondly we always have the entire house cleaned in the morning before weekend guests check in. There was no doubt about it.  Its a pity you experienced it this way. The bedsheets were absolutely clean they were put anew on your bed.<br/>As is been done for every new guest.<br/><br/>The cat never gets futher than the downfloor and the garden. Thanks for the positive review! Xxx Nice to read your positive review! Nice you enjoyed it so much! Hey Rahu and Pria thank you and I really enjoyed the stay of you.And how funny we met at the ferry last night :-) Hi Ike, I know it was a once in a lifetime messy weekend.  don't feel afraid to return and prepare yourself better. you are always welcome. <br/> A heart in love can sometimes make chaotic decisions :-) <br/>Have a good life and take care. yes then you have to be in the centre, but the price will be different as well:-) <br/><br/>Or you should have taken a bike. Its only 15 minutes from the centre :-) Hol nacho siempre bienvenido. Me avisas ;-)<br/><br/>El metro se estreno este a√±o! . Eln el centro estas en 5 minutos en metro son solamente dos paradas. En 20 minutos estas al otro lado de la ciudad o en el airopuerto. Amsterdam es muy peque√±o. :-) Thank you Adam ! Havr a good time in Sweden .  Thank you Jen! Hey Margarita,<br/> Nice to hear from you and good yo hear you had a good time. Also at the place of Anna !  Hi Marion the NDSM and de CEuvel are nearby the house. You can find them by bike but need to use y our google maps because it is the old industrial area go the Northern part of Amsterdam. Next time I tell you the trick how to get there. Its by ferry very easy :-) <br/> hey Daniel, Just 2 minutes from the house opposite to the centre is a shopping centre. And the cafe's and so on are hidden in the industrial areas ( NDSM)  and very hip and happening. You should have asked me and I could have explained you. One of those os Cafe de Ceuvel at on old ships warf were I have my gallery and performance room :-)  Thank you! looks good in Finnish :-) <br/> Hey Steve,<br/> All these details about the bicycle path, the park  and the distance from the ferry  are on my page. I think the fact that you got stuck because of the closed Coentunnel made it all very stressful for you and cannot be accounted for the place and the indication of my house on this page. <br/>Nobody had difficulties till now as much as the two of you did. :-) Even Chinese people arrive on time and without problems :-) <br/>As you might not have read well  or checked good the googlemap it  made me come and hour to late to my appointment too. <br/>Meanwhile I kept on making contact with you through the Aribnb app,  but you two didn't respond or informed me about the traffic jam that you got into until 3 hours after you set a time with me to check in !<br/>It would be a little bit more fair if you would reflect on your own part in this too. <br/>Have good trip home :-)  Thank you Renate I am happy to read you had a good time at my special space in the attic :-) <br/> Hey Maru I just arrived to your Argentina. Thanks for feedback.<br/><br/> thank you and enjoy life!<br/> very nice  Merci !<br/> Thanks a lot <br/> Hi Eric, Thank for you positive comment. Did you succeed in finding the Buiksloterdijk and the Ceuvel at the end :-)  Thank you Simon  Thank you Mayank  Gracias Pablo! Thank you Joshua!<br/> Thank you Soren!<br/> Thank you Trucie! Hey theresa what you write is just a big lie. Probably you need this to feel better. What a pity.<br/>Next time take a five star hotel where wverybody can be treatened as your slaves.  Hey Justin  thankx for the whole story you wrote to us.<br/> Thank you too!<br/> hey Pierre I hope you had a good return and see you again  have a nice summer! Thank you . Always welcome to come again Dear Stanislav. Thank you very much for this recommendation .And have a good life!  Dear Luke , Nice to read your feedback. Have a good traveling life, enjoy earth! Thank you too! And good luck with everything. Xxx  Hi thank you Hi Chih Heng, Thank you for staying and feeling comfortable in my house and the attic apartment . Hi Davide, Its nice that your review is positive. But it wonders me why you experience the city centre far away. Its 10 minutes by bike! And 20 minutes walk to the CS. For the price and the spacious attick there is a good balance between distance and costs. And otherwise you should have taken a space right up in the centre for triple the price? <br/> Dat Lolo and Thierry,<br/>Also you were very special en open for just blending into our house and colors :-)  I can read I. the google translator more or less . That you for your positive reaction and it was funny to see how you and. your friend switched the spaces night by night . We had a good drink !  :-)  Hey Javi that would be nice to see each other in the real old continent!  Hey guys , have a good life and always welcome in Amsterdam  No entiendo su texto ?  Thank you carolina for the nice review you made.  Hey Julia, Nice that you mentioned the bikes. It si Wonderfull to bike in Amsterdam and therefor the city centre becomes super nearby.<br/>Have a good life!<br/> Hi girls, thanks for the nice review. I will contact the bike shop it is from my neighbour :-)  Thank you yawed, Because of your visit I also realized how special it is to have Airbnb and meet  young people from all over the world. Young people that study and will make a beautiful future for the Earth.<br/> Kilian was the sweetest guest I had till now. He surprised me with a very special bottle of wine. I still remember the taste of it ! Oh you are ore then welcome to come again and then I will join you a moment in town<br/> :-) and show the pearls of the city . xxx <br/> Hey jennifer, did you see the NDSM at the end by ferry? You were so lucky with the weather. Have a good life and maybe you will return  Thank you and i hope you feel good after your stay üòÄüòç Very Nice to read it in Italian :-) See you later this year when there is sun and we have a beer  I hope you had a nice day in Amsterdam.<br/>Room is indeed in upcoming North and therefor very big and silent :-)  Hi Charlotte,  Nice to read in French. I will check the wifi. It must work but maybe some technical thing . Normally it has always been ok for the guests <br/> Well there is not a problem about the incheck procedure. Anna and Julian just came hours later then they informed us about. Without informing us and we received them good. <br/>Its easy to check in because its a matter of tuning the time or leaving the key elsewhere as we did  times before.<br/> It was lovely to have  a nice conversation about history <br/> There is a high stapel of towels in the bathroom that can always be used.  Hey Martin i hope you arrived well and save!  Thank you and nice you appreciate the art!"
21883308,"Dankjewel voor jullie geweldige review! Thank you for staying with us! On my listing you can read that the tramstop is a little walk of 8-10 minuts, so maybe you did not read it. And walking is very healthy for us people :-) Wat onwijs jammer dat je mijn accommodatie zo hebt gewaardeerd, kennelijk had je iets anders verwacht wat niet overeenkomt met wat 98% van mijn gasten wel gelukkig waarderen! Dear Ronny,<br/>Thank you for your review and for staying with us. During your stay I was myself at holiday, so I did not had the opportunity to meet you. In the summer during my holiday the tram line 1 was under contruction, because of the contruction perhaps it took longer to reach the city center and I am very sorry for that. However, the tram 1 is not anymore under contruction, so from Ecuplein to Leidsplein (Leidseplein is one of the main places in the city center, it is near the museum square, Heineken experience, flowermarket, Vondelpark etc.), it takes 20 till 25 minuts with the tram as before, you can check it on google maps. But of course it depence where you get off at the city center, for example if you mean Central Station at the city center ( that is located at the other side of the city center) then it take from Ecuplein to Central Station 45 minuts. And from the adress of the Private Studio to Ecuplein it is a little walk of maximum of 10 minuts if you walk slowly. And for the costs, I had written you on the airbnb app that a day card for ‚Ç¨ 7,50 or 48 hour card for ‚Ç¨ 12,50 or 72 hour card for ‚Ç¨ 17,50, so that is cheaper then every time buying for ‚Ç¨ 3 a ticket, but maybe you have not seen it... for the next time.<br/>Best regards,<br/>Nabila Thank you Liza for your great review! You are more then welcome next time!<br/>Best regards, Nabila Thank you Carol for your great review! By the way, the heater is working now well, a mechanic has repaired the heater, so hope to see you next time if you come to Amsterdam! Best regards, Nabila Hi Hazel,<br/>Thank you for your positive review! You were also fantastic guests! The extra bath towels were in the closet ;-) And Thank for the tip of the umbrella‚Äôs! Thank you for your amazing review!! With pleasure I would host you and your friends again! Thank you! Thank you Markus!! You and your friends were also excellent guests! Never seen such youg guests that are so recpectfull and clean! I am to late to leave for you a review, so I do it this way, and maybe I will contact Airbnb and ask if I still can leave for you an excellent review! I would definitely recommend you to any other  hosts without hesitation. Best regards, Nabila I am absolutely speechless, what an amazing review!! Thank you very much. Like I said you and your friend where also lovely and fantastic guests!  Dearest Emanuela, Thank you very much for your great review! Also thanks for your private review, you are a special and beautiful person that I had the pleasure to meet!<br/>Big Hugs, Nabila Thank you Nadine!! I wish you the best! Dear Ken and Liz,<br/><br/>Thank you for your positive review! You and Liz were also fantastic greatfull guests, love to see you back! <br/><br/>Warm regards,<br/>Nabila Hi Jerome,<br/>Thanks for the review and staying with us, you were kind guests! <br/>You say that the place is next to the center and ad the same time you say that it is a bit long (40min) and the cost ‚Ç¨ 4/pax? Maybe you had a the wrong public transport? Because with the tram 1 you reach the city center in 20 max 25 minuts, not 40 minuts and the costs are ‚Ç¨ 2,80 for 1 hour ticket. Perhaps I interpret it wrong, I apologize, but I react to your review so that future guests can read the correct information. <br/>Kind regards,<br/>Nabila Thank you very much for the lovely review! Dankjewel Hayat voor deze mooie recensie! Naar aanleiding van het gemis van een flatscreen, hebben we besloten om er een aan te schaffen voor onze gasten. Dank voor de tip. <br/>Hartelijke groet, Nabila"

Thanx for your great and kind review .  Welcome<br/>Back anytime ! <br/>Best wishes Jeroen Hi Deha , thanx for your reaction regarding our apartment  . I don‚Äôt really understand your problem with the big window because there is a ventilation system above the window . The window door is  always shut and nobody complains about that because there is ventilation above the window . You were probably not aware of that fact and thought there was no ventilation .. ? So it is in your head .. Anyway I also don‚Äôt understand that you thought the price quality is not good ? If you compare our prices with most of the other accommodations in amsterdam we are very reasonable and our prices are among the lowest  . It seems that you did not like the fact that you wanted a night‚Äôs reduction , last minute , 2 nights instead of 3 nights . And we did not agree to that , because we would loose a day‚Äôs pay . I think your overall review is not really fair and is not right . Good luck to you . Hi Osanne ! Thanx for the kind review ! Until next time . Best jeroen Hi Giovanni , thank you for your great review on our accommodation ! It was a real pleasure having you . Until next time ! Hi Helena , thank you so much for your kind review .

I asked you 3 times when you would arrive and you did not respond. I had to call you... You were difficult to get.a hold on Really weird review and this is not fair.

And the shower is kept as clean as possible , hopefully it‚Äôs not a disadvantage , haha ! Welcome back anytime ! Hi Lee , thank you for your kind review! But : From the central station it takes via metro and bus less then 20 minutes to get here. The metro takes you really quickly into town ! So it really does not take you an hour to get into the centre of town . At all !! Going to the pijp area is because of the metro here reachable within 20 minutes as well ! And there are nightbuses !

In your private reaction you wrote 'h≈çte simp', kind host, that is nice, but it is not so nice to write just 'blablabla'. I don't know what it means and people who read this want information on where to stay, and how other people liked their stay. Fortunately most/all of the other airbnb-reactions are more serious and very positive . Best of luck. Hola Regla ! Thank you so much for this very kind review , was great to have you guys .

Thanx, Jeroen Hi Paige , tank you so much for this great review. I really like meeting people here and tell them about Amsterdam and the North, so this review is so nice to read, thank you, and enjoy the rest of your visit in Europe ! Come back via Amsterdam and stay here again ! Best, Jeroen Hallo Nina , danke sehr f√ºr die  grossartige review ! Immer willkommen hier ! Jeroen Hi Bruna, thank you so much for your kind review, it was great to have you here, welcome back anytime ! Best wishes and enjoy your travels ! Jeroen Hi ÊôìÊù∞,Xiaojie , too bad you feel that way . I only met Xiaojie and his girlfriend when they left because after asking their arrival time more then 3 times , they did not tell me when they would arrive until 1 day before , so I had to ask somebody else to give them the keys because I could not be there in the evening because of a short holiday with my daughter at the sea myself..I am really surprised with this review , there is running cold water in the room and a sink, there is a water boiler for hot water, and there is hot water in the bathroom, which is 1 meter away from the room ! The linens I use are of course washed and cleaned and certainly not 'old', and the house is only 10 to 12 minutes from the central station with the bus 34, as is advertised and mentioned. I can't change the location of the house, but there is so much to see and to do in the north which is close by,like the NDSM area and the Adam Tower and its surroundings .. I never had a review like that before ! Very strange and unnecessary negative ..please read the other 193 reviews.. Hallo Sibel , danke sehr f√ºr die grossartige review. Ich bin froh dass es euch gefallen hat und hoffentlich bis schnell. Immer willkommen ! Sch√∂ne gr√ºsse, Jeroen Hi Hemath, thanx for your kind review and your tip regarding the bathroom ! Welcome back anytime . Best wishes, Jeroen Hi Aurely, thank you so much for your kind review. above the big window there is ventilation, but you are right, the big window was closed. I forgot to give you the keys to open them, sorry about that. at the NDSM stop the last ferry is at 12, that's right, but there is another ferry that goes 24 hours,behind the central station to the north, and goes every 6 minutes, so its always possible to cross the river ! welcome back anytime! Hi Kevin , thank you so much for your very kind review. It was a pleasure having you here. Glad you liked the tips..Welcome back anytime ! Hi Killian and Tiffany, great to hear and see that you enjoyed your stay here in Amsterdam, and  that you enjoyed your stay even better because of your stay here in the north ! Welcome back anytime .<br/><br/>Best, Jeroen Hi Priya, thank you for your extensive review. The room does have ventilation since there is a ventilation system above the big window, maybe you missed that. The room is exactly as it is on the photos, it has not changed since the photos where taken, so the 'unwanted' things were always seen on the published photos. Most people enjoy the room a lot , so its a matter of opinion I suppose.. Sorry that you feel that way, but the room is what it is as it is on the photos, I like it myself ..! There are 3 lighting possibilities and one you can set higher or lower if you want . There is an extra door which is to be locked, but that is only one lock extra, sorry to hear that it makes you feel stressful . you say that there is no mirror in the room, but there is! its above the washbasin. the washbasin is exactly as it is published on the photos ! Best, Jeroen Hi Stefano, thank you for kind words on the price quality of the private room and your tips on the beddings, I will use them ! Enjoy your travels . Best, Jeroen Thanx Pierre, was a pleasure to have you here ! Welcome back anytime ! Best, jeroen Hi Heidi, thank you so much for your very kind review . I always love to tell my guests where to go and what to do . Amsterdam has so much to offer ! Welcome back anytime.<br/><br/>Best, jeroen Hi Camila, thanx for the great review, and very happy you had a good time ! Welcome back anytime. Best, Jeroen Hi Christine , thank you so much for this great review ! More then welcome to come back !!

22479558,"Micheal's a perfect guest; polite, clean and clear in his communication, I'd highly recommend hosting him if you have the chance! Margaux and her guests booked my apartment with a request for a late check in at 0.00 on friday. We agreed on said check-in and I planned my day accordingly. She then informed me a day in advance that her friend would pick up the key 5 hours earlier than the original check-in time, which forced me to cancel my cleaner that would sort out the house before the check-in. I made sure the apartment was in a good state, but apologize if I forgot to hoover. I contest claims it was dirty though and am very disappointed her friend,who stayed in my apartment all night, did not contact me about the problem so that I could have still sent my cleaner over to sort out any inconveniences. Margaux agreed to adapt to my house-rules which mention to be respectful of my neighbors in terms of noise levels, yet on friday night I had to remind her to be more quiet, which did not sort enough effect after which my neighbor knocked on the door and spoke with her about the situation: she agreed before booking to adhere to my house rules which clearly ask to be respectful of the thin floors, yet had to be reminded twice. I to conclude contest the claim of their not being enough beds available: the sleeping arrangements were clearly explained in the listing and I feel that one who inquires to book, should have read them before conforming their booking."

22750552,"Hope to have you a other time as my guest!! Wish you all the best!<br/>Greets Karlijn You always welcome Guy's!! <br/>Wish you the best, greets karlijn Thank you so much!! You are Always welcome with your lovely family!<br/><br/>Wish you all the best! Thanks guys! You are more than welcome anytime!!<br/><br/>Wish you the best! You are anytime welcome sweethearts!! Thanks you too guys, for the great presents!!! Hope to see you again!<br/><br/>With love Karlijn Thank you Ali!! Hope to see you back! Wish you the best ;-) Dear Kirsten, I'm shocked,  your story about me! I have so many good reviews and I find this really terrible!<br/>I thought it was really horrible to you for what happened, but sometimes things happen beyond your power. I am so sorry for it!<br/><br/>I therefore like my response back.<br/><br/>Your point about the washer and dryer; Dryer was broken and in my list are these not the things you can use in my home. I offered you that i could do your was, only I could get was dry as the dryer is broken. Therefore have you yourself decided not to do the laundry because it would not dried up for your departure the next day.<br/><br/>The morning that my door was broken;<br/><br/>You called and I recognized immediately!! I direct pick up my phone. It was half past six in the morning and I was in the neighborhood, to work in home care. Luckily a colleague to take over my job I work in the hospital and can not just suddenly my patients leave alone.<br/>I did everything I could and I immediately called a locksmith to let you go out of my house. I found this myself terribly for you.<br/>Fortunately, I can wake my neighbor and I helped you over the balcony. I helpt you and your brother, not only your brother.<br/>Why do you say that I let you down and not immediately took my phone, I have no idea?? I did everything immediately and leave my work to help you!<br/><br/><br/>You now cares about everything in and around my house a negative review. I can say at this; I'm really hurt by you terrible review. Sometimes things are going wrong, where you can do anything.<br/>I therefore give you back your bad review...<br/>This is because, if something goes wrong, where nothing you can do about it. You are able to destroy someone with a bad review.<br/><br/>I said; You're lucky I close working home because it I mean, I worked happily that day close to home, otherwise I would not be so quick and direct you can help.<br/>i don't know way you're so mean to me. I was there in 10 minutes from the time you call me!<br/><br/>Kirsten, I hated that my door would not open and I did everything right again put into effect to help you as best as possible. If you read my reviews (super host), it can not be that I'm so like you describe me.<br/>You've had a bad experience, which I am truly sorry!  But in order to attract everything negative a i think that not fair..<br/>To make everything negative in and around my house, itself the area, walking distance from Vondelpark, all make you negative.<br/>The weekend before you were in my house and I have given a good review, you were happy about my house and the area! I don't understand that you over everything so nagative...<br/><br/>Therefore, I never hope to have this anymore, i am sorry to say, but you have really damaged my trust!<br/>You destroy a person with a bad review, if something goes wrong, I can not do anything to. <br/>You are  the ONLY guest who complains about the environment, transportation to the city, you take things in that are not fair, i think. I did everything to liberate you, what I should have done differently? You've got your plane, because I was just so quick there and did everything to help you. I totally understand that this situation was not fun for you, but I really could not help it...<br/><br/>I tried to call you when you got home and sent you a message a few times, why have not you called me back and then we can talk it out? Now you have chosen the easy way out and give me a bad review over everything in and around my house. You are unfortunately been a guest for me, which I could not trust.<br/>I had if we had spoken to each other with love and offered a free weekend at my house for the problem with the door! <br/><br/>Again, i am truly sorry for the door did not open, which has not happened before that the door did not get open any more.<br/>A new lock is in, this can not happen again!!<br/><br/>I wish you the very best, Greetz karlijn<br/> Thanks Guys! Bye :-) Thanks girls for leaving it so tidy!! And thanks for the Cake and pink flower!  Thank you so much Hannah!! Hope to see you Girls back!<br/>You are more then welcome!! Thanks you 2 for your kind words!! Very nice to read :-)<br/>Best wishes!<br/><br/>Karlijn Thanks you too!!! ;-)   Tamara and her husband were lovely guest!

22837110,Too bad you did not tell me one radiator did not work when you were here. Glad you had a good time aboard. Hope to see you again.
22847584,"Carrie is not completely accurate in her description. The water heater did brake, very unfortunate and very stressing for her to which again I apologise. The fact that she checked in very late on a Sunday night made it impossible to have a plumber come by. I tried my best but nobody would come by in the middle of the night. I therefore arranged that the heater was fixed early the next morning. Carrie then asked for a full refund of the first night. A little too much in my view. Her tone changed dramatically to which I gave her a choice: late check-out and no refund or refund but early check-out. <br/><br/>I always have my appartment cleaned before guests come by a professional cleaner. That there would be hairs and dust on the bedsheets simply cannot be true - I also never had the complain before. The house is located on the first floor - as is indicated in the description. The staircase is quite wide and certainly not steep. Airbnb demands that there is a washing facility in the building, which there is. That it's on the 4th floor therefore falls within the requirements. "

22923931,"Muchas gracias Miguel please feel free to come back any time Thanks Jon much appreciated  Wouter Thanks Mark! Hihi for clarification: the manual is the first thing I app when guests book, and when people show interest for booking, I always respond woth as first question: did you see that I have a cat that needs to be fed and cuddled a bit?<br/>Printed copy of the manual is on the dining table too.<br/>For the rest thx for the poz feedback Wouter Ali's review is rather harsh; the house was meticulously cleaned the day before (as 95% of the other reviews also state) but yes: in the 20 hrs before check in some cat hairs will be on the couch. Most probably this review is negatively influenced because we approached the guest because he stayed with more then 3 people whereas the max allowed is three - which might have made him grumpy. The only thing I apologize for is the hair dryer, it broke last week. Thank you Jeff! Let me know when you want to come to Amsterdam again you're very welcome Wouter I regret Alejandro's experience and that he did not inform us immediately so we could check and fix on the spot. Experiences that guests have in this very sexy modern style Amsterdam house, luckily differ between guests, please see all the other reviews below. Hi Anja super thanks and hihi.. Renting out / sharing one's own home is the cornerstone on which airbnb is based so yes, it's not a bed & breakfast, it's a personal home incl belongings. Glad you appreciated the spaciousness and how clean it is. Thanks Wouter Wow suuuper thanks Anna! <br/>Google translate: Wonderful house, hospitable Wouter! Everything is even better than expected. A picturesque place, the house has everything for a comfortable stay. Near supermarkets, metro and tram stop. A beautiful courtyard where you can drink coffee in the warm season. Hard 5! Thank you, Wouter! Wow suuuuuper danke, gern gemacht Hehe letting people enjoy your place when you're away: that's exactly what's airbnb is all about hihi."
23256355,"Hi Amer,<br/>I am sorry that you found the floor dirty, my cleaning lady must have forgotten to wipe the staircase in front of the main door.<br/>It is the first time I receive a negative feedback regarding the cleaning and I feel very sorry about it, I will make sure it will never happen again. Same in regards to the fridge and towels.<br/>Regarding the broken tables, they were temporarily manually fixed (they have been overused during the Covid time) with extra support until I get the chance to replace them with new tables. Sorry that it bothered you during your stay I will make sure to replace them asap.<br/>Thank you for your feedback and I apologize again for the inconveniences during your stay."
23286921,"Again, many thanks for staying with us. I saw the review we left for you was wrongly addressed as you did not travel with your parents but with your friends :)"
23556233,"To all future guests: don't worry about the check-in time. If you like to check in early, ofcourse it is easy of we organize this in time. With regard to the location I am very surprised with the comment. The apartment is located within walking distance from vondelpark, museumsquare and leidsesquare and the tram will take you to the city center in 8 minutes. To me this makes it a fantastic location, but that's my personal opinion because I love my apartment and the area it's in.. See you soon! Femke"
23593514,"Hi Lisa Marie thank you very much for the feedback, we have added more pictures to the listing. We will use the feedback to make the experience for future guests even better.<br/>We thought the listing clearly states that this is a private room and not an entire apartment.<br/>Also in our messages we communicated to you that we live at the same address. Our sincerest apologies if this somehow was not clear.<br/>Our only moment of contact are during check-in and during breakfast. Breakfast is prepared on the spot<br/>Although we enjoy getting to know our guests, we do expect our guests to clearly share their needs with us, be it breakfast wishes, travel tips or the need for privacy.<br/>Just to correct the review and provide more nuance, the living space is not shared. The room is private and has a lock on the door with key.<br/>Ultimately, even though we value your feedback very much, we feel that any of the other 200+ reviews portrait the experience one can expect a little bit more accurately.<br/>Warm greetings<br/>Cherry Tree Bed & Breakfast I am very pleased that you enjoyed your stay with us so much and happy we could add on to your positive experience of Amsterdam.<br/><br/>As for the warm water, I don't really understand what the problem was. At the bath tub it's a simple single handle mixer tap, pull the handle all the way to the left you get piping hot water, all the way to the right ice cold water and somewhere in the middle adjustable warm water. Under the shower, also a simple mixer tap for hot and cold.<br/>It does take a second or two for the hot water to reach from the central heating unit, but that's about it. I'm sorry that this may have caused an inconvenience and in the future I will ask guests if they are experiencing issues with the warm water. <br/>Thank you for your review. Thank you very much for the glowing review.<br/>The direct bus from the airport that you mentioned stops about 15 minutes walking distance away from us. If one also has luggage then this is not a recommended route and as such I usually do not mention it. However, I will definitely keep your comment in mind for future reference though. Thank you."
23802419,"Hi Nanna, thank you for your stay and your lovely review, hereby the translation:<br/>My friend and I have been so happy that we chose Klaartje's room. The bed was large and comfortable to lie in, nice to have a fridge and the option to eat breakfast in the room. Klaartje had given us so many recommendations for places to eat, and we tried quite a few of her recommendations, and each time we got a completely unique taste experience. We also used Klaartje's recommendations for walking routes in Amsterdam and it was also really easy to use tram 4 to get back and forth from the center. Klaartje is an absolutely fantastic host, she served us a sumptuous breakfast the first day we were there and her little notes during the stay just made it a really nice place to be. We will definitely come again next time we visit Amsterdam. Merci beaucoup pour ton avis Sonia, je repense √† votre s√©jour dans ma maison avec grand plaisir.<br/><br/>Hereby the translation of Sonia's writing: One of the best airbnb's we have been to. The location is close to public transport, shops and restaurants while staying in a very quiet street without night noises. The room is very clean, well equipped for breakfasts and quick meals. Klaartje was very attentive to our needs and her generosity made this stay a special moment. Sharing and smiles filled us with joy. Thank you Klaartje Thank you Luc and Claire for your stay at my place and this lovely review! Hereby I will give the English translation: ""Great address for a stay and to discover Amsterdam, the location is ideal and the room very comfortable, we highly recommend the magnificent  room at Klaartje's and it's hospitality!"" Thank you Adriano for your lovely reaction and compliments! Hereby the translation: ""The place is fantastic! Very well located, decorated and cozy. Excellent choice for couples. The hostess is very dear and helpful. We strongly recommend Klaartje's space."" Thank you Sergio for your lovely review. Hereby the translation: The room is as shown at the pictures. Very good hostess. She gave us many indications and excellent treatment. Highly recommended. Thank you Nicolas for your lovely review! It was lovely to host you, thank you. Hereby the English translation: ""Our stay at Klaartje went perfectly well. The room is spacious, well equipped and filled with little touches (flowers, Dutch sweets). Klaartje welcomed us warmly and provided us with valuable information about the city (you will find all this information on the cards available in the room). The accommodation is really well located. The street location is very quiet while being in the lively area of Pijp (excellent restaurants with terrace if found and a super market). In addition, you are 100 meters from the tram-stop taking you to the historic center (around 5 stops). In short, all conditions are present for a good stay! Thank you Klaartje! :) "" Thank you Laura and Mikey for you compliments. Kind regards, Klaartje Thank you Geraldine for your review! In Amsterdam the stairs can be very steep! Even more steep compared to the one in my house; can you imagine ;-). I hope it did not bother you too much. To future guests; please do mind in Amsterdam the stairs can be very steep, please mind to not bring large suitcases!<br/>Hereby the English translation: Very attentive hostess who takes his time to explain things. Very nice neighborhood. The steepness of the stairs to the room should be reported. Thank you Aurore and Antoine for being my guests! It was lovely to have you. Herby the English translation of Aurore's review: Super Airbnb near the center of Amsterdam. We liked its proximity to transport and many shops and cafes while being in a quiet street. Only 30 minutes walk from the center, the use of transport is not mandatory. The room is very well equipped (towels, hot drinks, sleep masks, ...). It is sufficiently isolated from the rest of the house to feel like in a whole house. Thank you Giovana for your stay at my place, thank you for your lovely review. Herby the English translation: Excellent location in residential street with shops and public transportation very close. Super comfortable room with private bathroom, plus mini refrigerator and utilities for coffee, tea and light meals. Klaartje is a super host in the extended definition. Affordable, friendly and with great neighborhood and city tips. Certainly will come back at another opportunity! Thank you Brandon, you are most welcome to come and stay again! Kind regards, Klaartje Thank you Benjamin and Daniela for your lovely review. It was a pleasure hosing you, having your sweet atmosphere in the house. Hereby the English translation: The home of Klaartje is super cozy, a place with private bathroom independent of the other facilities of the house. It is well located, about 30-45 mins walk from the center or a few blocks from the tram station. I recommend her place, I would definitely go back. Thank you Jean Jacque for your review. It was lovely to host you.<br/>Sweet to call my place a 'small apartment', in fact it is a 'single room', although it contains a mini kitchenette with tea, coffee and a small fridge and of course your own private bathroom.<br/><br/>English translation of Jean Jaques' review: Small apartment in a quiet street typical of Amsterdam. Very close to the center. After renting a bike at the address advised by Klaartje, we took the public transport 250 m from the house to go to the airport. Klaartje is very attentive and considerate ... Thank you Aline for your sweet review. Hereby the English translation; Nice little apartment very well located and charming hostess. Thank you for your lovely review! Hereby the English translation:<br/><br/>The landlady is a lovely artist. She enthusiastically introduced many of the attractions for her guests, also provided lovely drawn sheets of the Dutch food and delicious restaurant. The space is very comfortable, with its own bathroom a simple kitchenette with tea and a large table, very good light, every morning waking up with warm sunshine and the birds singing. Thank you Vivian for your lovely review! I am touched.<br/><br/>To all guests who stayed at my place:<br/>Thanks you for bringing the world to my home. It is a pleasure to host! Klaartje Thank you Bline and Michael for your lovely review. It was lovely to host you. Thank you for your stay at my place. Hereby the English version of the review: ""The weekend trip to Amsterdam, staying at Klaartje's place was simply a super idea! Communication with Klaartje was very good both before arrival and in general. Accommodation exactly as shown at the photos, if not more beautiful. Great connections through the walking distance to the tram station into the city. What made the trip especially so special are Klaartje's numerous and great tips, both in terms of eating out, and the evening planning. Highly recommended and gladly again! :) "" Thank you Ariel (and Lucio) for the wonderful review, thanks for staying at my place!<br/>Hereby the English translation:<br/>Our stay in the house Klaartje ( Bed at Pander ) was very good, she is a luxury hostess and made us feel my son and me as if we were at home. We got all the information we needed to manage in our passage through Amsterdam. She made us delicious surprise breakfasts! Beautiful experience. Thank you Lorenza, Manuela and Mariachiara for staying at our place! Hereby the translation in English:<br/>""Nice Hospitality , Klaartje proved to be a kind and helpful host. The house is comfortable, the neighborhood is full of bars and is as convenient as downtown!"" Thank you for your lovely review Alphonse! And with this reaction I would like to thank all my guests and the reviews I you wrote me. It is a pleasure to host.<br/><br/>Hereby the translation of Alphonse his review in English: ""Beautiful Home ! The room is lovely, clean and well located twenty minutes walk from the city center! A big thank you to Klaartje was a very good host: she prepared small cards with the best things to do, visit and taste in Amsterdam! I recommend it to you!"" Thank you Gerhard for your lovely review! Translation to English: Had a great time in Amsterdam. The apartment is very quiet and still you get quickly to the center, if you want. The room, the shower and toilet are clean. The hostess was very friendly and even invited me on the first night for dinner and gave me useful advice. As a welcome greeting ne chocolate lay on the table. It was so delicious that I bought a stock for the home of the same variety. You get from the hostess to request a tram ticket that you can recharge. This saves you 7.50 euros. Thank you Sara for your lovely review!<br/><br/>The translation in English:<br/>Klaartje was really nice. The room was lovely and comfortable and warm, for a chilly like me. Quiet neighborhood, the tram downtown is the number 4 it takes 12/15 mins to get to Dam Square. It leaves just near the house. Well linked. Super recommended. Klaartje is great! Thank you Stephanie for your lovely review! I am happy I got to see your animation in EYE filmmuseum; you are an amazing animator. Thanks for your stay at my place. Thank you Dennis, I am flattered. Thanks Clem for your positive review!<br/>This is the 10th review written about bed-at-pander since I started at airbnb. I would like to take this as an opportunity to show my gratitude and thank you all for your lovely reviews! Everyone who has been to my place brought their own unique atmosphere to the house. It has been a pleasure to host you on your stay in Amsterdam! Thank you all, Klaartje Hi Charlotte! Sorry for your discomfort. True, the kitchen is not included. If you would have asked, of course I would have kept your drinks cold! Though for your future visit I took it as a tip; now a small fridge is at the room for your convenience! With kind regards, Klaartje"
23886273,"Thank you, it was a real pleasure to have you with us, and I truly appreciate your kind private message:<br/>Thanks Marielle, we cannot think of anything more which could improve on what you already do. You are the best super host we have experienced. Much appreciated. Kind regards Gwyn and Chris Dear Alice, as shown in the advert we offer two very comfortable Pullman boxspring single beds (twin beds) easily placed apart or tied together for everyones wishes and conveniences! <br/> Thank you, it was an absolute pleasure to welcome you! <br/>Concerning the Amsterdam stairs we welcome a lot of retired guests from Australia, Canada, USA and Europe the oldest guest was fit senior of 83 years old, no complains about the stairs :)) <br/>But as mentioned in the description when you have physical disabilities it might despite the rails to hold on to a challenge for all ages.<br/>All the best from the Jacob van Lennepsstreet! Thanks for the kind review, good the hear you enjoyed your stay with us.<br/>And as we have these typical (steep) Amsterdam stairs we're always there to assist carrying luggage upstairs , and I have to admit the weight of your suitcase comes in the top 3 of all time :) I was so glad I could arrange a ticket for  the sold uit Ballet of Giselle for you, it must have been beautiful  hope you enjoyed it!<br/><br/>It was pleasure to welcome you, thanks for your visit! <br/>Thank you so much Victoria it was a real pleasure to welcome you. The beds are PullMann boxspring beds, the coffee maker is a Nespresso machine with aeroccino:) Looking forward meeting you again. I'm blushing ...thanks for your visit, you're welcome any time! Hi Shelby, glad we could extend your stay and thanks for the kind comment about the apartment, next time please inform me immedeately about the WiFi, I could have given you the code of our other fast WiFi connection (also 180Mbps download/ 20 Mbps upload!)  for your comfort without any problems. <br/>I' m really sorry my other guest didn't respect the houserules (exceptional) I 'm really embarrassed about that and wished you told me so I could have take action as I don't tolerate guest disturbing other guests late at night/early in the morning...<br/>Kind regards,<br/>Marielle  English translation: <br/>Everything as expected: small but very nice apartment with everything you need. Marielle guided us with precision and welcomed with great sympathy and told the surroundings, even less known. Very quiet area, well served by public transport and a 10-minute walk from the museums area and Vondelpark (wish we had had with us suit and booties!). ""<br/>Thank you Paolo! Thank you so much Tanja, it was a real pleasure to welcome you. <br/>The beds are PullMann boxspring beds with extra topper!<br/><br/>Review for English speaking  guests:<br/>The apartment is exactly as advertised and more perfect is impossible! The most comfortable beds in the universe! We felt at home and the location is simply unbeatable. I recommend it to everyone and I would like to come back!"
23923878,"Thanks a lot for coming Michele, it was a pleasure to host you. I indeed live in the apartment. This is common practice in Amsterdam. In Amsterdam, Airbnb rental is only allowed if you actually live in the place and not longer than 30 days per year due to regulations from the local municipality. I've updated my page and replaced the towels, thanks a lot for sharing the feedback. Welcome back anytime!"
23928189,"thanks Toby, you was a wonderfull guest!<br/> great guests to have over!  you are more than welcome!"
24002310,"Now it would actually be time to say thank you. But in your review you criticise the dirt and dust in the room. I regret this very much and will point out these deficiencies to the housekeeping staff. I am very sorry for the inconvenience.<br/>On the other hand: It's a pity that you didn't tell me immediately that there was dirt and dust. So we had no chance to remedy the problem - it would have taken a few minutes and you would have been happy with us.<br/>Toilet: We already write that the private toilet is outside the room on the AirBnB advertisement page. We will highlight it more for future guests.<br/>Thank you for your review. Good day.<br/>I am very sorry that you had such an experience. It should not be like that. Our team consists of five nationalities and we usually know how to deal with strangers. <br/>You were a guest for several days. Now I don't know which person I should talk to in order to improve their hospitality. Unfortunately, I also don't know exactly what happened and when.<br/>In any case, I am very sorry that you had such a bad experience with us.<br/>With kind regards<br/>Hans <br/>from the team of Guesthouse Keizersgracht Thank you very much for your feedback. We are very sorry that your room was not as clean as you can expect. <br/>It would have helped us - and you - if you had informed us about this during your stay. Within a short time, the problem would have been solved. And you would have had a more enjoyable stay.<br/><br/>Important note: A breakfast cannot be booked in our guesthouse. Sometimes we invite people for a free breakfast. Sometimes. In general: All bookings do not include breakfast. The booking includes only the room and service described in the listing. Many thanks for the feedback. Of course we regret that you did not feel comfortable with us.<br/><br/>But a correction is allowed: ""Breakfast was just boiled eggs"" is misleading for others. There is bread, cheese, yoghurt, fruit, coffee, tea etc. as well. Due to the Corona regulations we are obliged to adjust our breakfast buffet. <br/>As far as eggs are concerned, it is true that we only offer boiled eggs, but not scrambled or fried eggs. This can certainly be expected in a guesthouse of another category than ours. Es realmente lamentable que nuestro personal (ama de llaves y se√±ora de la limpieza) haya tenido que notar un fuerte olor a marihuana proveniente de la habitaci√≥n de Sebasti√°n y su amigo. Esto viola nuestras reglas de la casa. No toleramos las drogas en la casa de hu√©spedes.<br/><br/>Cuando me acerqu√© a Sebastian en la calle (a tres casas de nuestra casa de hu√©spedes) ya estaban fumando como locos. El olor llen√≥ toda la calle y tambi√©n lo notaron nuestros vecinos. Le aconsej√© al amigo de Sebastian que se durmiera mejor, parec√≠a muy cansado. Eso es mejor para su salud.<br/><br/>Que Sebastian escribe esto y aquello sobre nosotros: Entiendo su af√°n de hacer que todo sea malo para nosotros. <br/>Somos amables con nuestros hu√©spedes en el Prinzep, pero cuando se trata de mantener las reglas de la casa (no fumar en las habitaciones. No drogas en la casa) somos implacables. Tambi√©n con Sebstian y su amigo.<br/><br/>Quien busque la libertad sin fronteras en √Åmsterdam seguramente encontrar√° mejores anfitriones que nosotros. De lo contrario, todas las personas del mundo son bienvenidas aqu√≠. Il tuo punteggio totale di 5 stelle √® naturalmente molto apprezzato da noi. Grazie mille!<br/>Nel tuo messaggio scrivi che il bagno √® fuori dalla stanza. Purtroppo i visitatori dell'annuncio ricevono informazioni errate.

You can certainly alternate with one voucher between several devices (so one device at a time). It is your choice to use the voucher included in your booking as fast as you want. If you need more vouchers, its 1‚Ç¨ for each. With any booking the internet for 1 conncetion is free of charge.

We think, thats a fair price. Only now we read about problems with the internet. It's a pity that you didn't tell us about it during your stay. Many problems can be solved quickly, e.g. by restarting an access point in the guest house. We would have done it for you. Thank you very much for the feedback.

I'm sure your particularity has had a strong influence on our communication. The check-in left me completely confused. <br/><br/>It would have been helpful to me if you had mentioned it. A missed chance. Thank you for this feedback! It saddens me to read about your problems in the room only now. During your stay we could have taken down the mosquito net in a few minutes and you would have been comfortable. Dank u voor de feedback. Ons plan om de muur tussen kamer 22 en 23 tegen geluid beter te isoleren, kon in 2020 niet worden gerealiseerd. We hadden er de laatste jaren al heel wat geld voor gespaard. Toen kwam de Corona-crisis en het duurde langer om al het geld bij elkaar te krijgen. Pas nu is de begroting rond en zullen we de werkzaamheden in augustus 2021 uitvoeren. Daarna zal iedereen rustig kunnen slapen - in beide kamers. Bedankt voor de feedback!<br/><br/>Het is jammer dat u de situatie niet optimaal vond. Dit hangt natuurlijk altijd af van waar je naartoe wilt in deze stad. Het Rembrandtsplein ligt op 4 minuten lopen, de Opera op 5 minuten lopen, de Magere Brug op 3 minuten lopen, de Waterloo vlooienmarkt op 7 minuten lopen van ons.<br/><br/>Maar het centrum van Amsterdam is groot.

Er is met de schoonmaakster gesproken over het hoekje bij de tafel en er wordt voor gezorgd dat zo iets niet opnieuw gebeurd. Excuses hiervoor. Het spijt ons dat U dit niet tijdens uw verblijf al aan ons heeft laten weten. Dan hadden wij er meteen werk van gemaakt. Wij staan altijd open voor oplettendheid en zullen U graag van dienst zijn. <br/>Met betrekking tot de bekers op de kamer is het helaas zo dat eerdere pogingen met glaswerk tot ongelukjes en veel kapot glas hebben geleid. Hierdoor hebben wij toch maar besloten om plastic te gebruiken. <br/><br/>Vriendelijke groet en hopelijk tot ziens,<br/>Zeb Lelie,<br/>De Housekeeper van de Deutsche Seemannsmission Amsterdam"

It was great to host you, Anton. Relaxed and pleasant!  Muchos gracias. Adios! Thank you so very much for your wonderful stay! It was nice to host you! hello Devin, Thanks for your stay and constructive feedback. I immediately moved the p.c.-table and p.c. to my own room. So I can use it more frequently. Also, now the rented room has more space. No guests used the p.c. anymore. Because they all use the wifi. Have a nice spring time! Muchos gracias, Jorge. Hello Cori, I really LOVED your stay very much with your great mother and very friendly son. And thank you so very much for your chats and concrete and detailed feedback. I really appreciate that. Also you gave me very special Mickey Mouse soap and a beautiful t-shirt. I am sorry that the rooms were not yet ready, but I was overwhelmed that you arrived half a hour earlier then we agreed. If you ever come back I will make you a tasty dinner! Lots of warm regards! Merci beaucoup! WAUW, THAT SOUNDS GREAT! Thank you so very much for your long stay and detailed review. I like it very much that you enjoyed your breakfast at my TINTIN table. My father made it. Yes, I had to work hard and had no holidays during your stay. I did not know that you could hear the television. I never heard anybody about it. If you told me I could simply just turn down the volume. I hope you, your mother and daughter are well. And I wish you all the VERY best. Hooray. This is GREAT to read! THANK YOU VERY MUCH! It was a real pleasure to host you nice, energetic Italians! Dear Jamie, it was great to host you and your niece. Good luck with your work and everything. You are welcome any time! Thanks for your stay, Justin Kim. You are welcome, Heidi. Vielen dank, Tobias. You borrowed my iron and have been ironing in the room.  That is fine. Other guests did that, too. But you ruined my Mickey Mouse rug. It was a special collector's item. Now there are more then 15 tiny black burning spots in it. After I confronted you with the damage, you denied it. And even blamed previous guests! Although I told you that I always double check everything before new guests check in. I am disappointed in this behaviour. And thanks to you, too, Elodie! Wauw, dearest Benita. What a complete and explicit positive review. Thank you so very much. I really hope you will be back once. Thanks again for your stay and nice chats. Take care. Merci beuacoup. C"" etait tres agreable avec vous! Thank you very much. I am really glad you enjoyed your stay so much. Ethan, I really hope you will come back again once.

Yes, the hydro power from the water of the shower is not as strong as in modern houses. My house was built around 1910.  I also love strong showers in modern houses.

Feel welcome any time again! Keryn we felt very honored by your visit! Feel welcome any time you like!<br/>Thank you very much. All the best. When Stephanie made a booking request for two persons, we thought she was nice and honest. At the last minute she asked about a friend coming over for only a drink. But in the end we found out he was staying for the night. Normally its no problem for an extra person to stay but we had no extra bedlinen or towels! Also an extra person is 50 euro/night this was told after we found out and is also mentioned in our house rules! After that everything went wrong. The friend stayed for three nights! They came home in the middle of the night (at 4 pm) without keys to enter the apartment. So they had to wake my daughter and were very noisy and had a rude attitude. The last day: they didn't left the apartment till 13.00 and when our cleaning lady arrived she found drugs in the apartment, while our house rules say this is not allowed! She was surprised that they need to pay for the extra guest and even asked to stay for another night despite the stay was not a pleasure at all! Sorry Stephanie but we did not like you as our guest! We don't understand why you want to cheat and lie. Sorry but no recommendation as a guest."

25255796,"Hi Julia, thank you for your review! Would appreciate it if you can give me a hint/suggestion how I could have made the two mattresses (very good quality) also very comfy for you? Thank you in advance. Without exaggeration, you hardly can have better guests! So Benjamin and Brady hope to see you again, some time in the future! Thank you so much for your lovely comments. After all..... we understood each other very well, which results in a good and loving communication. Wish you both all the best. Thank you Kelly for your comment! Thank you Aristos for your nice comment. Hope you enjoyed the marathon?! Well John, I don't know if I can live up to that standard but thank you so much for your positive and great comment. Wonderful guests are easy to host. Gina, it was great meeting you and your mother!! Thank you for your very nice comments! Thank you so much Mariasilvia for your lovely comments. Guests like you make hosts do the extra mile! Enjoy summer and hope to see you in the future. I understand Meg's reaction as to the construction noise, but as I thought I explained to her as well, that this construction work is one of the few going on in the neighborhood (sometimes there are none). Although this is known as a quiet area, compared to the busy centre,  construction activities can take place everywhere. There are days (weeks) that the site is rather quiet, other days there is indeed noise. During the week that the foundation was constructed I did not rent my place and I am always, so far,  in good contact with the builders.<br/>This is living in a dense populated Amsterdam, even out of the centre.  Hi Ville, I am so curious to know what you have written. Unfortunately I do not know anyone who can translate from Finnish to Dutch (or English). I also understand German, French and Spanish). Hi Ben, I have not yet been able to find someone who can translate your comments. Is it possible that you write the same text in English? If you do not have time or whatever, that is of course also okay. I am just curious what you have written. Txs in advance!"
25381221,"Michael and his friends stayed over at our place for 3 nights. He is excellent in his communication, very polite and happy to think along with solutions. On multiple occasions he pointed out improvements on our appartments' profile. He was flexible in adapting some last minute changes. He was on time, and left on time. Would recommend to host him You're more than welcome Thank you Liane for seeing my neigbourhood from a new perspective (Is there any restaurant that serves pancakes? Is there a volleyball court?) Thank you! Thank you for the kind words, Fr√©d√©ric. I am glad that you had a good time. "

25982521,"Dear Ariana,<br/>I'm sorry to hear that your stay did not meet your expectations. Our photos are recent, and the apartment has undergone renovations to make it even nicer. Previous guests have had positive experiences, and we strive to maintain high standards for everyone.<br/>Regarding the mice, I understand how unsettling this can be. Unfortunately, mice can occasionally be an issue in Amsterdam, especially during the rainy season. I promptly arranged for a professional to address the situation and offered a complimentary night's stay as compensation. I regret that this did not resolve your concerns.<br/>Airbnb is a platform where people share their homes, which can be different from hotel accommodations. For those who prefer a more standardized experience, a hotel might be a more convenient option.<br/>Thank you for your feedback, and for acknowledging my efforts to respond promptly and courteously. Future guests can rest assured that we are dedicated to providing a pleasant and comfortable experience.<br/>Best regards,<br/>Camille Merci √† vous ! Appart niquel c'est g√©nial üòä"

Je suis d√©sol√© pour votre mauvaise exp√©rience, mais c'est le r√©sultat de votre propre manque de recherche. Dear Raimundo, what a shame that you did not have a pleasant stay in my house in Amsterdam. I'm sorry that the house did not meet your expectations. We let the cleaner clean our entire house, like we always do. During the weekend I did not hear about the apparent low quality, I would have done something about it. As far as the location and the stairs are concerned, I do not understand your point. You will see clearly in advance where the house is located. In addition, I marked in 'things the guest needs to know' that we have a steep and narrow staircase. Sorry for the apparent bad experiece."

Which I'll do immediately! :) Thank you for the kind words Mayuka, the cats and me enjoyed your presence to. Good to hear that you enjoyed your stay here. You're always welcome back... Thanks for your lovely words, the pleasure was all mine :) Thanks for the cool ADE t-shirt! :) Thanks Michael, you have been a great guest as well and I really appeciate when guests know to cope with pets. danke sch√∂n Thank you for your kind words and company during your stay Florence. You're welcome back anytime! :) Hey Francois, your 4 and 3 star ratings are really disappointing. About the price/quality ratio: I continiously compare my rates with other hosts and ho(s)tel on Booking. Your nice words and private messages don't match with the ratings you gave me, it feels like a slap in the face. Thanks for taking your time to leave a review behind. I really can't relate your 3 stars ratings, especially given the fact you have stayed only 12 hours at my place asking for a refund because of your cat allergy. I thought I was helpful to you with giving a partial refund. Don't punish hosts with a low rating for the nuisance not being caused by them. This feels really unthankful. Thank you so much for your kind words Elvania! üôèüèº The postcard is on its way but I assume it will take a while to reach Canada :) Welcome back anytime, take care! First of all, thanks for your nice review and rating! I'm glad that you had a great time. at my place Regarding to the price I just want to say that I, unfortunately, had to raise my rates mainly because of the inflation. In order to stay competative I compair my rates on a regular base with other accomodations in the area. I can say I'm still one of the cheapest options on the market. Like you've said yourself already, other accomodations are not cheap either. Why the 4 stars for location and value if you haven't stayed at my place? Hi Hanna, I‚Äôm surprised with your overall rating with 4 stars. Could you please tell me why and give me some feedback so I could improve things? I'm dissapointed and surprised with your review man. Apparently this is what you get when you try to be helpful with free laundry and free storage of your luggage. Hi Marc, I had soap in the kitchen, in the toilet and additionally on the sink in the shower. Besides that there was showergel, shampoo and soap in the shower cabin. Could you be more specific where you missed soap?"
26577733,"Dear Ragnheidur and Siggi I was so fortunate meeting you guys in person! So lovely to hear the stories how things are in iceland and absolutely loved the excitement that you had for this trip. I hope I can make it soon to Iceland. Wish you and your kiddo crowd all the best. Thank you Michael! wish you all the best. Regards, Lizzy Dear reader,¬†<br/><br/>Of course you shouldn‚Äôt be happy with my apartment as a honeymoon suite! It‚Äôs not advertised as honeymoon suite, it is my actual cozy home! If you are looking for a Honeymoon suite in my neighborhood area then try Conservatorium hotel. Abi paid 129euro a night for my apartment. This place nearby you can book for an average of 1000euro a night in this season. If you walk down my street there is another hotel were the price per night has an average of 260euro a night. And then you also have to eat out every day, up to you. You can also scroll down my profile and read the review of Becky who also had her honeymoon in my apartment and had a great time. <br/><br/>Please have a look into my photo gallery to see how my shower really looks like. But since u actually read this you probably already did! Maybe one day after winning the lottery I can afford myself that nice rainbow shower Abi is referring too. Until then I have to do it with just a ‚Äòshower head hose‚Äô, poor me.¬†My mom taught me that shower curtains are a source for germs so I prefer using the shower wiper to dry and clean the bathroom directly. Sorry this takes 1 minute extra out of your day for drying my very royal shower!¬†<br/><br/><br/>There is a dishwasher in the apartment so there is no reason to eat or drink from dirty plates. Also the couch is an Ikea 90 degrees washable couch so if you ever spoil something we can always wash it, when it comes out I won‚Äôt charge you extra, your welcome!¬†<br/><br/>And yes my apartment is located on the first floor in a typical 1930 Amsterdam building. So be prepared for a real local experience. If you don‚Äôt have biceps travel light but then again it is just the first floor!¬†<br/><br/>Cheers!¬†<br/><br/>Lizzy¬†<br/><br/>Ps) If you like a real nerdy fact; Amsterdam only allows us to rent out our apartments a certain amounts of days per year. So there is never a running in and out of travelers. You probably also already know that Airbnb always pays you back some money even after arriving at a place and cancelling within 24 hours. <br/><br/>I apologize on beforehand if you didn't read my advertisement properly, that you have no clue of living expenses and property prices in Amsterdam, that you didn‚Äôt look into my photo gallery and that you don‚Äôt read any cancellations policy before you actually book. I am so sorry for you. <br/><br/>Be always welcome as a traveler in my apartment. If you feel more like a tourist or princess on the pea please book a hotel. You can always contact me with any questions.<br/><br/> I wish everybody happy travels all over our beautiful world! Travel is the only thing we can buy that makes us richer. May we be open to see and receive this blessing. So nice meeting you in person Dilara! Wish you all the best. Elizabeth  Thank you Nicole! Hope you had an awesome time. Welcome back any time.  Thanks for letting me host you Jonas! Happy to hear to enjoyed your time here.  Thank you Becky for your stay! Always welcome back in your Honeymoon city :-) "

Thank you for staying Michael! Hi Maria, great to hear that you had such a nice stay! Due to the fact that you arrived at the apartment 1 hour earlier than expected, the host that was scheduled to welcome you had to adapt her schedule quickly and did her very best to meet you at the apartment as soon as possible. Apparently you told her not to rush and that you would wait in a cafe close by. She arrived after less than 30 minutes and found you in front of the door.. The bed is indeed a boxspring, with a comfortable double top mattress. All the best, Boy"
27489189,"Hi Kyle, we found out that the gas spring - that normally eases the controlled closing of the hatch - was broken and will be replaced.

Thank you for your honest feedback, and I'll take it as an invitation to work even harder in the future to make sure my guests have the best possible experience. I am very sorry my appartement did not meet your expectations! As a host, I always hope my guests have the best possible experience. I feel very well in my home and it is always very sad to hear that my guests do not share that feeling. Your review encourages me to in the future take even more care to offer the best experience possible. Hey! It was not necessary to take a train; the apartment is situated in the city and to get to the city centre, you'll be there by tram in 15 minutes or at central station in 20 minutes!

28154037,"Great to hear you were happy. See you next time:-) Hope to see you back Amanda Thx Jamie, so happy to hear. You were a great guest! Thanks Jonathan for  the positive words. Right back at you! Hope to see you back Dank je Sascha, zie je graag weer terug Thx for the very positive recommendation. Highly appreciated Dear Michela and family, thanks for the nice review. I was happy to have you as my guests! Hopefully see you a next time Thanks for the lovely words. Very mutual Thanks David, thats great to hear. So happy you were all happy. Hopefully see you back! Thanks for the kind words. Hope to see you again soon! Merce Stephane! A la prochaine Dear Julia and friends, good to hear you were happy. Hopefully see you a next time<br/>Best<br/>Annette Thanks Georgia. Feeling was mutual Hi Sinead,<br/><br/>I am so sorry to read that my house was not up to your standards. I normally always mention (and it is written on Airbnb!) that the four beds are in small children bed rooms. I also mention that it is a family house. When adults want to stay at my appartment I always mention this too in the one to one communication. I am sorry that you missed this in my text on airbnb. I see that I did not mention it in my one to one communication, so that is my mistake however as you did not reply to none of my messages (I had to contact airbnb to make sure you were coming, you remember?) that was probably why I dit nog send you more information.<br/>Again sorry. You are my first guest who is nog happy. I ill do my best to listen to your tips HI Raffi,<br/>As it is an house I live in with my family theree is a lot off stuff around. If you want an empty house you should book an hotel or a house with is not ""really"" an airbnb<br/>I do not have an AC (not normal in Dutch houses) so I wonder when it did work? Thanks Martin for your positive message. See you back in Amsterdam! Thanks for kind words Natalia. Happy you enjoyed your stay! Dear Isabelle,<br/><br/>Thanks you of your nice words. I am happy you had a good stay.<br/>Hope to see you back<br/>Amicalement<br/>Annette Thank you Stacey for the sweet words and compliments. Hope we can welcome you again Thanks you dear Pierre-Louise for the kind words! you were perfect guests and we ar happy that you had a good time<br/>Amicalement Annette Thanks you Chloe, very nice to hear you liked it!<br/>Amicalement annette Thank you Ofer, for the nice words. I hoped you also had a good time in the other part of the Netherland<br/>Best regards<br/>Annette Thanks Kit, for the friendly words. You are definitely welcome again next year! Thanks paulina, you were perfect quests. Happy you liked it! Thanks so much Alejandro. I am happy you liked it. Thanks for being our quests"
28561678,"As you can see, we only have positive reviews besides this one. We are honest people. These guests damaged our sink without any notice. This issue is currently under review by Airbnb. Besides these guests were both too late for the check-in and check-out..."
28614173,"Thank you for your kind words Olivia! Please come back and stay longer.<br/>Warm regards,<br/>Patricia"

28640347,"We have no access to kitchen en terace because of the so many restaurant options in the area. A large park, right outside our place gives you acces to a great nature surrounding. We regret to hear that you had this unpleasant experience. Our reaction has been indeed not proportional. Having said this you were very noicy around midnight. We feel we should compensate in some way and we will. I suggest to have contact about this event and I am convinced we will come to a satisfying compensation. Thanks you so  much for staying! Have a good trip back home or to your next destination! Thank you Marie! We love doing what we do! Thanks for your feedback. In Januari 2019 we will do some renovations and we will for sure place a small table in the room. Breakfast will again be available on weekdays too. The kitchen and rooftop terrace are available for our guests daily until 12:00. <br/>The entire villa can also be rented during specific dates during the year. Unfortunately the information of this guest is incorrect - all our guests have access to the sunny terrace and kitchen daily until noon. This is also clearly stated in the advertisement. Furthermore we request our guests indeed to take others into account and reduce their noice as of 22:00 hours.  Danke schoen! Ihr seit immer wieder wilkommen! LG Dear Matina, thanks for the feedback. Pls note that we are renting out a room + exclusive bath room and not an apartment. The kitchen and terrace can be used as described and its shared. And that is the Airbnb concept, which many visitors like so much! Rgrds. Danke Dagmar, hat uns gefreud. Parken ist uebrigens kosteloos auf eigenes Grund, vor dem Villa. Elaine, sorry to hear that you are diappointed. If you read the profile info, our route description and info about the house sheet; you would have been familair with all details/info. We are surprised and disappointed too about your stay as you did left the room pretty dirty! Again we think youngsters like you are not our primar target group. Please refer to the more than 70 guests reports before you that gave us an average of the maximum satisfaction rating!  Thanks Adrian, you and your grilfriend have been one of our nicest guest until now!! See hello to Laura! Thank you Kriztina, there is a hair dryer now and please note that our double fridge in the kitchen is for general usage."
29116854,"Thanks for your review. I‚Äôve to say we disagree about the stairs though! Even oversized luggage goes up there ;) Thanks for staying and pointing out the stairs are no big deal for (oversized) luggage, always got everything up ;) <br/>Hope to welcome you again mate Guests where OK but apartment was left dirty, same during their stay. This isn't just a problem for cleaning but also attracts vermin. Wouldn't agree on having them again."
29360280,"Thanks a lot, welcome back anytime!"

29647728,"I hope people read the other 465 reviews, that have high ratings. This guest was the exception. He had to wait four minutes (!) to get checkin instructions. And then had complaints about almost everything and left and wanted money back. Our cancellation policy is strict, so when he did not get the money he decided to write this review. Yes, the Little House is truly Little, the loft is for children or grown ups who don't mind a tent like ceiling. As you can see on the pictures. We do our best to give our guests a great experience, an oasis in the city. We are very sorry that the wifi was not working. we have now replaced the rauter, that turned out to be the problem. But that could not be repaired during your stay. A electric hot water boiler of 200 liters is normal hot water for four people having a shower. You can do so twice a day. It is correct there is no microwave in the Little House. This is due to city regulations. It is for idden to rent out a BnB with kitchen facilities. That is meant for long rentals to inhabitants. I am sorry to read you did not fully appreciate your stay with us. It would have been nice to hear this on departure, I now understand why you left without notice. Communication in French is indeed a bit more difficult for me than in English. Sorry about that. The house is very central, so it can happen that people pass by in the night that are coming from a night out and that are not quiet. The night you stayed was the Saturday before Christmas, a night somewhat nosier than usual. The strangest review ever. Yes, we heat only up to 20 Celsius, yes we clean the sheets with ecogical non perfumed detergent, yes we have a boiler system for heating the water, so if you use up all the warm water it stops, yes we have wooden tiles in the showe instead of ceramic... Never ever in the seven years that I am a host did we have someone leaving before spending the night. Probably Marla is angry because we did not refund her for not staying. I hope whoever reads this, reads the other reviews as well Deze gast was bij ons middenin een Europees droogterecord, van alle kanten werden burgers opgeroepen om minder water te gebruiken. In Frankrijk zitten hele dorpen zonder water, dus we waren wat strenger dan normaal. Wat hygienisch en onhygienisch is, daar durf ik geen uitspraken over te doen, wel weet ik dat dit de allereerste keer in ons 7-jarig bestaan was dat hier moeilijk over werd gedaan. Zelf wassen wij onze eigen handdoeken √©√©ns in de twee weken en dat overleven we al ons hele leven. Gasten die een week of langer blijven bieden we halverwege wel extra handdoeken aan en ook heb ik aangegeven dat de handdoeken gewisseld konden worden als er echt vlekken in zaten. Graag hadden we de opmerkingen over de minder nette ruimtes gekregen tijdens het verblijf, onze schoonmaker doen juist hun best de ruimte goed schoon te maken, dus deze klacht verbaast ons, we zijn alsnog benieuwd om welke ruimte/plek dat precies ging. Sowieso iets meer direct contact en iets minder klachten achteraf zou ik prettig vinden. Sorry that the cleaner forgot to put the dishtowels in the kitchen, it should be tehre. The birds in the tree above the terrace are terrible! I clean the stuff every time new people come in, then the birds come and: kabam! Maybe I will put a bucket and old cloth out. You are welcome, just let us know True, there are no cooking facilities. We will change the text so that this is clear. There is a small kitchen to prepare breakfast or lunch, a fridge, water cooker, coffee maker, BBQ outside and a microwve inside, but no oven or stove. En inmiddels hangt er dankzij jullie tip een tweede spiegel in het huisje. Want vier dames en √©√©n spiegel dat was wel wat weinig ;)"
29650604,"Hi Megan,<br/>Thanks for your review. Sorry to hear that your stay wasn't as you imagined it. However the listing clearly says that the  kitchen and washer are not included with the room. (we don't mind that our guest use the kitchen but on an appointment basis as it is attached to our living room) As for the kids, they know not to make notice when the guests are in (see other reviews). Perhaps you didn't leave your shoes downstairs after you entered (This the way we know that you are in and then they know to keep it down) Hi Sylvia, I wish you would have told us about the heater because it wasn‚Äôt broke but it seems you turned it off by accident. Hi Beatrice,<br/>We are sorry to hear this. But we can assure you that we never used this toilet. As for the kettle I checked but found it clean. We never had any problems before and told you to contact us if you had any issues or requests. I really wish you would have come to us so that we could have solved this problem. Hi Zoltan,<br/>Good to hear you enjoyed your stay. <br/>We do provide access to the kichen and refrige on request. All you had to do was ask :)<br/>Kind regards,<br/>Derek and Iman"
29651612,"Hi Angelica, as you know the issue with the internet was a DoS attach on my router soon after you logged in. The same issue appeared on my private internet after I gave you access. I have provided you and the service desk the log files of my router as proof.<br/>I advice you book a place with a dedicated workspace if you require high speed streaming internet on multiple devices at the same time. Thanks for your stay Brittney. I do hope that you have found the stairway light switches. Hi Fran, thank you for your review. You write that everything is good except that you miss some recommendations for eating. I would like to point out that exactly these recommendations are provided in my personal travel guide in the app. I also told you that you could always text me on the app for recommendations, which you did not do. I am sorry that this misunderstanding caused you to not give me 5 stars. Thanks for your stay Mathilde. Thanks for your stay Sebastien. Come again. I pride myself at providing a clean, quiet refuge in the hectic centre of Amsterdam. The fast majority of my guests are happy with this and give me 5 stars. <br/>So, when you mentioned a ‚Äúmassive rat‚Äù in your message to me I was very concerned. I searched the room for any evidence of a rat or mice. I did not find any eaten stuff nor any droppings, as I have never found. I asked the guests that stayed here before and after your stay, and they did not hear or see any rodent. I did some research on the Amsterdam canal rats and it appeared they stay close to the water and do not go up to the 3rd floor.<br/>As proof of the ‚Äúpest‚Äù you send me a photo of two flies in the room. If at night you keep the lights on with the window open, insects will fly into the room. You could have used the fly screen to prevent this, as I told you during check in. Anyway the two insects could easily be gapped from the sky with just one hand since they recently hatched and were very slow.<br/>So what is going on? We had some problems at check-in. You rang the bell nearly two hours early. We had discussed that early check-in was not possible that day, twice. So it must have been clear to you. When I explained you the house rules, it was obvious that you did not read nor liked them. I assume that this was the reason why you left without even sleeping here. <br/>I did not refund you since I do not believe that there is anything wrong with the apartment (and Airbnb agreed with me), and thus you gave me a 1 star rating on all ranking elements. Thank you. Please do not come again. It was a pleasure hosting you Christine. Come again, Amsterdam is lovely in any season. Thanks for your review Gavriel. It was a pleasure hosting you. Come again. Come again Javier, it was a pleasure hosting you. Thanks for your stay Joel! Thanks for your stay Amelia! Thanks for your stay Amy.  Thanks for your recommendation Cecilia. Elevators are very rare in these old canal houses, and our stairs are actually quite lush for Amsterdam standards. I would be happy to host you if you return to Amsterdam. Thanks for your stay Marc. It was a pleasure hosting you. Hi Vera. I am so sad about your review. As I had told you, I requested you partial compensation for the damage that you caused by leaving my place very dirty. I could not rent it for the next two days and had to rent a specialised cleaning service. <br/>To quickly respond to your other statements: 1. The shower is not leaking if used normally. 2. I don't care how much toilet paper you use. What I do mind is finding it everywhere in and under my things. 3. If you would close the shower door, the rest of the studio will not get damp. Also there is indeed a tiny window in the shower, but a much bigger one in the bedroom. 4. There is a fan available and I told you that you could find it on the actual attic of the apartment. 5. If you could get a better room at the same location, why then did you let Airbnb call me to quickly accept your reservation?<br/>Since your review is so out of line with my other reviews, I expect that other guests will realise that your review is not according to reality. Hi Paul, <br/><br/>Thank you for your review. The internet was not working due to a problem with the cable company. The power-line wifi extender provides a closed network for my guests only, to make sure you have a secure connection, and that there are never too many users. Fortunately the cable company fixed the problem the same afternoon.<br/><br/>I fixed the water spilling on the floor from the shower.<br/><br/>Cheers, Bart   Hi Jason. I am surprised that you did not have a the best time at my apartment. You have never mentioned any issues to me. The apartment is indeed not very big, but I dont think extremely small is a correct qualification. You can find bigger spaces, but they are more expensive. <br/><br/>You had a problem with your foot. I can imagine that walking up to the 3rd floor can be a problem then. Unfortunately, not many canal houses have elevators. The monumental, 400 year old stairs are for Amsterdam standards actually pretty spacious. But I guess that in your condition, any stairs would have been difficult to climb. <br/><br/>The sounds that you heard on the roof are from birds. It was nesting season so they made a bit of extra noise.  Hi Peter, I offer a private apartment that is clean and quiet. Similar quality, but bigger apartments at this location are more expensive. The bed is indeed a combination of two single beds together of 180x210, which is larger than continental European King size. Thanks for your suggestion Luc. I will put a water cooker in the room with some tea and coffee. Since the tap water has the same quality as bottled water (it does not even contain chloride), I don't think that bottled water is needed."
30203349,"Das w√ºnsche ich auch :).<br/>ps Sorry for the window. I guess the painters who recently painted our house were a little too enthousiasic. Hope I can manage to open it. It should be able to open of course. Haha, it was used very well!! Lieber Robert und Freunden,<br/><br/>Herzliche Dank f√ºr Ihre ausf√ºhrliche Bewertung! Ich werde Ihren Tipp auf den Duschvorhang √ºberlegen. Alles Gute f√ºr Sie und vielen Dank auch f√ºr das unbefleckt hinterlassen von meine Wohnung. Mit entschuldigung f√ºr mein schlechte Deutsch ;) Hi Kelly, due to personal circumstances I failed to write a recommendation. So sorry because it felt so nice having you as my guests and enjoy chatting with you. Thanks for coming and leaving my house so well. All the best and love to see you again ever... Thanks for your precise comment! The paint is caused by painters on the ground floor apartment. Sorry for the inconvenience. The floor in the bedroom will be replaced in september and yes you are right about it. The neighbor downstairs is abroad for months. Wich is nice and quiet but mail stays at his front door waiting...:). And the  (new) toilet brush was not in the right place so you could not use it. Sorry Thank you so much for your feedback. Sorry for missing the extra washcloths and umbrella's. I'll make sure that they will be there next time  and for future guests :) Thanks so much Jianna. Although we met brief, it was a great pleasure meeting you and family. Always welcome again! Wish you well.. X Das freud mich... Thanks so much for your warm review. It was a great pleasure having you and your family. Hope to meet you once again. No mess at all :)! Viele grusse Heleen Hi Nell! Thanks for your review. I'll think about changing the curtains :). Wish you well. Thank you so much Alon for your detailed review!! It was great fun meeting you and your inspiring wife and lovely boys. Felt familiar from the first moment. Always welcome again."

30827622,"Thanks Sumi for your compliments. We're sorry to hear about the towels as they came right out of the laundry. We always ask to inform us of any inconvenience so that we can fix it right away. Afterwards that's diffucult for us. <br/>I don't remember we had any company during your stay, only we received one late phone call due to time difference with our family. Sorry if you experienced that as disturbing. Hi Alex, thanks for your review! We will take your remarks into account and fix the insulation and the water from the shower running into the room. Anyway the bed is quite big (210x90cm) for a single bed:) All the best! Dear Katie,<br/>We are sorry that your stay in our apartment didn't cover your expectations. In many cases we can solve any problem right in the moment, but if you don't communicate anything, how do you expect we can solve it? As a Superhost on Airbnb we have 99+% very positive reviews mainly due to very good communication with our guests and the comfort of the room, so we are highly suprised by your comments. <br/>Also we don't understand your remarks as they don't correspond to the actual situation. Of course the bathroom is private and en-suite as you can also see in our profile pictures. There is a laundry machine and dryer and even we proposed to do the laundry for you. Also we would like to remind your remarks during the check-in that our apartment and the room were above expectation. So we were suprised that you complained to Airbnb only after 2 nights.<br/>Thanks for your comment about the mattress, we replaced it already by a harder one. If you had asked us, we could have done this for your right in the moment. If we receive any more complains about the dog also we're going to replace her:)<br/>Despite this situation we refunded your last night to show our good will. We had a little hope you would appreciate this.<br/>kind regards,<br/>Juan & Pim Super thanks! U are a beautiful women! Hope we meet in the future. üòö"

Hope to see you back. Cheers, Marcia Hi Nigel,<br/>Thanks so much for your lovely words! We are glad that you enjoyed your stay at Zoku Amsterdam. We truly look forward to hosting you anytime soon in the near future!<br/>Cheers,<br/>Anh Dear Amanda, thank you for taking the time to leave us a review. I wanted to take a moment to address the feedback that you shared with us. Firstly, we are indeed a hotel, and as such, we are obliged by Dutch law to charge city tax to our guests. This is stated in your reservation confirmation email. We wish to make this information more transparent to our Airbnb guests but the Airbnb platform does not allow for any alternative way to display this information. We have brought this matter up to them numerous times and a solution has not yet been provided. Sorry to have let you down on this regard. Regarding your room upgrade, please rest assured that you stayed in one of our Loft XLs, while your reservation was for a Loft. Both lofts are similar in design but the Loft XL is 30m¬≤, which is 6m¬≤ larger than our loft. Consequently, the living room, the couch and the bed are larger. It also features our signature gymnastics rings and a sound system. For more details about both lofts, I would refer you to our website. Lastly, I am happy that you enjoyed our dinner and our pastries from the cake table. There are tags on our cake table with the prices of all the items we sell. Next time, if you're unsure, feel free to ask one of our Sidekicks :). Thank you once again for your review and we hope to welcome you back soon, whether it is in Amsterdam, Vienna, Paris or Copenhagen. Cheers, JP Hi Debra,<br/>Thank you so much for giving us this lovely review! We are happy that you enjoyed your stay with us at Zoku Amsterdam.

We would love to learn what went wrong and understand how we can prevent it from happening again in the future. We hope to see you again another time and restore your faith in Zoku! Cheers, JP Thanks for your review and feedback, it really helps with improving our services! Again thank you and enjoy your evening. <br/>Cheers,<br/>Marcia Dear Abdulhakim, we are disheartened and sorry to hear about your experience at Zoku. We take the safety and security of our residents and colleagues very seriously, therefore our hotel is equipped with card readers to access the guest floors (both in the elevator and the stairs),  a separation door, also equipped with a card reader that only grants access to the lofts to residents staying on that floor, CCTV installations and regular bag checks of our employees. By no means did we infer that you were lying, sorry if it came across that way. We have done everything we could to look into your situation but could not conclude anything based on the facts that we gathered. In instances like these, we can only advise our residents to file a police report and leave the matters to the authorities. We wish you all the best and hope to welcome you at Zoku again, whether it is in Amsterdam, Paris, Copenhagen or Vienna. Cheers, JP Thank you Stephanie for giving us this lovely feedback! We hope you enjoyed your stay with us.

30946768,"Thank you Holly. I would like to add that the price of 100 EUR is the price that we have been charged by the company managing the accommodation for coming to help you at 5 am. We are not making any profit on that of course. Also, we have been nice enough to reduce the price for your mistake and take the difference as a loss for us. Sorry for this very unique situation as we were on holidays and we left our house to people that did not respect the rules. This had never happened before and will certainly never happen in the future."

31275614,"Alison and her family have been staying in our apartment for four days, and they‚Äôve been lovely guests. We would definitely recommend them as guests to other Airbnb hosts. Eugenia and her family have stayed in our apartment in Amsterdam. A reliable, warm and easy-going family. Communication went smooth. It was a pleasure to have them as guests.  Hanne and her family have been staying in our apartment for four days. They are nice and friendly guests, who were very neat and clean. They‚Äôve left the apartment in excellent condition. A very kind family with lovely children, who play the piano well. They‚Äôve been perfect guests: enthusiastic, decent and reliable. They‚Äôve left the apartment neat and in excellent condition. A very nice and lively family. It was a pleasure to have them as our guests. They‚Äôve left the apartment in perfect condition. We‚Äôve no complaints about this family at all."

31365652,"In the profiel it is quit clear we have a dobermann. So if you have an allergie of dogs our house is not for you. Because they arrived early we allowed them to put their bags in the room. They respond very rude.  It is unfair to complain  that it was dirty. The cleaning lady hadn't arrived yet. Also they had the choice between the sleeping couch and the new not old matrass. Probebly they expected a room to do drugs due to the mess they left. I did not write before because I thought they were cranky because of the bad flight and one guy was afraid of dogs. But the complain is a disgrace. I advice every airbnb host not to host them. They don't deserve your hospitality.<br/><br/>Hans(Husband of Leah and in charge to host due to the fact Leah was in hospital) Muchas Gracias Carmen. <br/>Esperamos verlos de nuevo. Fueron excelentes hu√©spedes. <br/>Leah Jack Thank you for your evaluation you were great host as well. :-) <br/> Hola patricio. <br/><br/>Creo que no le√≠ste correctamente mi sitio. oficialmente no ofrezco desayuno, a menos que lo acordemos y no estuve al tanto que te hubiera gustado tener dicho servicio.

31501327,"Avec plaisir ! Merci √† vous. Thank you Emily you will be warmly welcomed. Thank you for your comment. I am surprised, however, that you only gave the value for money 4 stars. I think you are not aware of the prices in Amsterdam and with much less or no extras that I offer and that you enjoyed (Clipper teas, nespresso, guides, etc.) Airbnb taxes are high yes but not the night at my place, too bad you penalize me for that. Do another search for a stay in Amsterdam and you'll realize that. Greetings Thank you Francisco so kind of you üòä I am really surprised by your comment, it is the first time I have had such remarks if you have read all the reviews from people who have stayed at my place.<br/>I think that you have not read the advertisement: it is clearly stated that the flat is on the 3rd floor and that there are stairs to climb.<br/>You find it too expensive, from what I have seen after your visit you have taken advantage of all the extras I offer to my guests for their comfort: coffee, tea, jams, tissues and kitchen roll, guidebooks, etc. You don't find all this in every Airbnb.<br/>I don't agree with you that the walls of the flat were dirty, I don't know what you mean and when I see the state in which you left the kitchen we could discuss cleanliness, we don't have the same point of view, it's obvious! <br/>It's true that we have done some renovations in the flat and the walls in the hallway and on the stairs have not yet been washed, is it necessary to make a big deal of it? You are the first and only one to point this out.<br/>Also you say that the blankets had not been washed, this is not true, I can assure you that I take great care to keep my flat clean as well as the linen provided for my guests.<br/>And lastly, you talk about cat hair: no cat has ever entered the flat or been in contact with the flat's belongings, so what you say is completely false. I think you are being disingenuous because if everything you said was true, knowing that I live above and that I had told you that I was at your disposal in case of need, then you would have warned me about the points that posed a problem for you instead of making a false and unfriendly criticism after your departure.<br/>A piece of advice for your next trips: book hotel rooms instead, as you don't seem to appreciate the effort the hosts can go to in order to receive you, nor the charm of being among the locals. Indeed, you have to keep in mind that renting an Airbnb (instead of an hotelroom) amounts to living in an apartment between locals who have an active lifestyle and therefore out of kilter compared to holidaymakers. Also most of the houses in Amsterdam date from the 1900s and therefore do not have the acoustic insulation of modern houses. All this must be part of the charm of the trip to Europe :) Dear Barbara, thank you for the remarks but maybe you have not read the description of the apartment : it is well indicates that it is 35m2. Considering the photos of the bathroom I think they are accurate enough to realize its size. You can't expect something more if you don't look the informations. I have been hosting guests from all backgrounds, ages and nationality with Airbnb since 2015. I have never had a problem with all my other guests before : respectful and clean the apartment was left in good condition.<br/>This host chose to eat in bed - which Is not forbidden - and unfortunately stained the wallpaper. The stains made by him on the floor and the tablet of the bed proved those of the wallpaper he refused to recognize.<br/>Photo evidence has been recognized and accepted by Airbnb. The problem has been solved thanks to Airbnb assistance! Q.E.D.<br/>I am very cautious about the condition of my apartment and the wallpaper and I want my guests to come to an apartment that is super clean! The 5 stars I normally receive each time proves this. forgiveness for the work noise caused by the neighbor: these are things that we can unfortunately not predict or control! Thanks a lot for your kind words Daniel, I am glad you enjoyed the city as well as the apartment. About the stairs, they are steep but not EXTREMELY steep as Josh writes, if you know the houses in Amsterdam you will find that our stairs are even rather comfortable! <br/>Thank you very much for your nice note ! who knows ? maybe one day in India...<br/>You are welcome back any time ! Whoo ! thank you very much Rhona ! I'm going to use some part of your comment in my description :-)"
31641559,"Dear Gillian, how painful to see you rate a 3 for accuracy, referring to the kitchen. In the description on the site it is very clearly indicated, the photo's are also clear in what to expect plus in my emails I have mentioned very clearly what is and what is not to be expected, specifically about the kitchen. I believe it is ultimately important to manage expectations of my guests. For that reason I will pay extra attention to this topic, although in the last 350+ 5-star reviews this has not really been mentioned as an issue by other guests. Always room for improvement though :) Angharad & co were lovely guests. Highly recommended! Panagiotis and his friends were your ideal guest: easy to talk to, respectful, place left neat and clean. If you can host them, don't hesitate Dear Sam, thank you! We are so happy you had a great time and like it here! We make sure to 'make a space' if needed when you return to Europe! Take care. Apologies for missing the chance to leave a review, Michael. For whatever it's worth, you were great guests. Thank you for taking care of the place like it's your own. You made it very easy! Thank you, it was fun meeting you! Very happy you enjoyed yourselves! Take care. Clive and his family were great guests. Independent, polite, easy going. The house was left spotless. We would love to see them back. Thank you for your kind words. And don't worry about jam etc. Next time ;-) Take care!  Nadia and her family were great guests. Clear in communication, easy and nice. We really appreciated how clean the house was when they left. If you get a change to host them, don't miss it! Thank you for your kind word. It was our pleasure to get to know you and your family! What a lovely bunch of people you are. I hope we meet again... in Amsterdam, Milan or Prague... ;-)"
31817443,"Was lovely to host you! I am sorry Lorraine that I was not able to stop the child abuse a few doors down that you heard - screaming kids, that is a really strange phenomenom, next time  I hear children screaming i will don my cap and go on a rescue mission. Kids need be silent, not heard. Ja. Apologoes, the girl that was living there for the past year as the airbnb host, Amy, was moving out. She is a chatty, bubbly happy girl, so i apologoze that having her mother and friend come to move her stuff out was scary for you. It is a shared flat, so it can be that the resident has their family visit in from canada over to stop by and help with moving her stuff out. :) I just cant get over how ppl who use AirBNB expect to stay in a hotel.  If you want a hotel, pay 4 times as much.  If you want to save money and be close to the center, than u use AirBNB.  What do ppl think AirBNB is?? It's not a place for hoteliers to advertise! haha.. :)  I just stayed in an AirBNB in Paris -- was tiny, pricy and not as clean as I keep my place. I think 'dump' is a bit of an extreme word. Anyways, the review made me laugh, im not angry or anything, and ok, i agree with you, please don't come back :) I have a feeling u gave me such a low review bc I didn‚Äôt let ur friend stay for free.. As for the toilet- toilets are in small closets here, if someone uses it, it will smell for a few mins! I provide odor spray, aside from that don‚Äôt know what I can do! :) Homes are very small in the small country of NL, especially in Amsterdam center ‚Äî probably only in an expensive hotel can one have sound-proofed rooms in Amsterdam center! :) Sorry if that was awkward for u! I don‚Äôt understand where the house was messy though.. All the best! :) Sorry about the smoke -- as me and my husband were away we had our co-host manage the house for us, however, it is listed as a smoking house. Most of the time it is not very smoky, but some people smoke a lot! That said, there is a door to the backyard which can give fresh air to the room always -- I also don't really like smelling cigarette smoke, but as most places are smoke free, I like to offer people the freedom to smoke if they like (but always air out the place after! :) ) Hey David, Yes, I wish I could have responded more quickly -- sorry if my co-host wasn't able to respond quickly -- as it was a last minute trip to Canada, and my co-host helped me last-minute, she still had to work and likely was unable to access her phone too often!  And yes, CLUTTER is BAD!!!!  :)  Houses in A'dam are SOOOO small, it's easy to get too much stuff on tables! :) Hope you had a good time in A'dam otherwise!!  All the best! Maybe you didn't notice, but  there is hangers and a place to hang clothes, and a dresser with 3 drawers to put clothes in.  As for the cold -- yes I suppose perhaps it got cold in Holland recently for a day or so, it's just switching from summer to fall and as I was away on a family emergency, my co-host/cousin wasn't living there, and as it is still pretty warm there, likely she didn't put on the heat, as it's not really neccessary.  There are 3 extra blankets in the room out in the open.  Sorry if you were cold!  Usuallly I am living there and can turn the heat on if (and when)<br/> neccessary WOW.. you didn't even stay at our place! This is an angry review because we did not refund her 3 nights which she expect when asking for it on the day she arrived.  I explained to you that I had a family emergency and was out of the country and that I had a co-host that would manage the house. She messaged you many times asking when you would arrive, so that she could come beforehand to prepare the place, but you only messaged her once you arrived.  Nobody had smoked in the house for a week, and we open the patio door in the bedroom after every guest to air out the room.  So childish when people leave nasty reviews out of spite.  It's not a HIlton or a hotel, it's AIRBNB. (eye roll)  :) Yes, sorry, as you came late at night, though I was waiting for and expecting you, I had fallen asleep... SORRY!! :) I think that was a first for me (as usually I am a night-owl :)  ) Hey Oscar, First time I went to the post office, they wouldn't take credit card, and to take money out from the machine to pay them would have cost me a few euros, SO I had to wait until Darius (my husband) was back from his grandma's.  SO, we mailed it 2 days ago, probably will take at least a couple of weeks, as the faster mail was like 15 euros extra and I didn't think that neccessary - -the way I wrapped it makes it look not like anything interesting for a postman to steal, and on the 'customs' label i wrote it was a used jacket forgotten at my place, andvalued it at 30Euro, b/c if I wrote it was new, or really expensive then the governemtn would demand custom tax from you.  But it was FINALLY sent, I took a picture of it, and they also gave me senders reciept. I am drunk (it's New Years Eve, 2:30 am -- I have a flight to catch in 10 hours, so I don't have time to send u all that stuff, but will be back in A'dam on the 15th, so if you want those pics, let me know, or i will just try to send them to you when I am in Estonia (as they are on my phone). FUCK i don't want to go to the airport tomorrow -i'm so stupid, WHY fly on the 1st!???  I'm so stupid, should have gone on the 2nd... haha.. Well, Happy New year, and please let me know when the jacket arrives!!! Hey Gabriel, Yes, the various flies that arrive in the house drive me crazy -- we found a melon that we had just bought a day or two earlier, and somehow it molded super fast.  I can't help the spiders -- windows here don't have any screens, and anyways, who knows where they come from! Hope you weren't scared of spiders! Sorry about the smoking -- if anyone is a guest reading this, please let me know if you hate cigarette smoke (I understand -- used to put no-smoking signs around my house when I was a kid!), so I am happy to make the house non-smoking. Some guests like to smoke, some don't -- if nobody complains, I let people smoke in the house. But, I don't mind not living in the smell of smoke, so if that is your preference, please let me know! Thank you so much, Jess! It was such a blast having you stay with us!  Yaara was an awesome guest! Great to talk to and hang out with !<br/> Hey Victoria -- I think you forgot to ring the doorbell -- as we were at home when you arrived.  I think you must have knocked on the door (which is the door to the entire house, not our flat door), rather than ringing the buzzer (as we were inside the house and when you called us we were able to answer the door).  Hey Lennart, I'm sorry about the messaging, I was away on holiday in Egypt and had given my cousins number (she was handling the place) to all the guests that had booked before I went to Egypt, and I did not expect the wifi to not work at our hotel in Egypt, (there was a massive rain/hail storm that knocked out all the wifi) so my apologies for that.  My cousin was checking the AirBNB site daily but, yes, I acknowledge, it was probelmatic not being able to communicate with guests quickly.  Normally I get the messages directly on my phone, but my phone also did not work in Egypt. I'm glad you still had a good time! Hey Vahid, I apologize if there was a problem with your luggage -- when I am in town (I was on holiday in Egypt when you were here) I am usually able to let people leave their luggage here if they have a full day to spend in Amsterdam.  As my cousin was watching the place for me, she had to go to work, and so could only let you keep your luggage until 15:30 here (which is quite reasonable as most hotels/hostels expect people to leave by 10am to 12noon).  Again, as I was on holiday, I did the best I could to ensure that the house would be kept clean and everything be organized while I was away, and I apologize if it wasn't to your standards.  Normally we don't have an issue with that.  Van Gogh Museum and Rijks museum are about 20-30 minute walk, as they are on the other end of the center from us, if u take the tram it takes not much less time, as the tram goes much out of the way to get to those locations.  Amsterdam is a very very confusing city -- I get lost when I go to new places, even after living here, google maps are not so helpful, street names change and then change back, so it can be frustrating and wind up taking more time than if you know how to get there directly. I hope you had a good time in Amsterdam and I apologize that I wasn't here in person to deal with your concerns.   Hey Harry -- I'm  sorry about the cigarette smoke -- so you know--- when you book on the front page of my listing my place is listed as a 'smoking' house.  If someone has a problem with cigarette smoke, if we know beforehand we are happy to accomadate them by smoking outside. But in future, you can check the features of the spaces you are renting, and then you can see whether they are smoking or non-smoking.  It is quite clearly listed on peoples profiles. As you may remember I had the back door to your room open, to the garden, so that there was lots of fresh air in the room (as we only smoke in the living room which is separate from the bedrooms).  Hope you arrived safely home and take care!! All the best! And Andrew, you were a great guest as well!! Not sure if I did your review in time, but I would reccommend Andrew to ANY host!! We would love to have you again Cornelia!! I'm so sorry about  that Katie -- yes, I was out of the country and my cousin was watching the place -- normally I only let people smoke weed if I know everyone else in the house is ok with it, or ask them to do it outside.  As for the loud music -I don't know what happened with that -- I'm so sorry that the first day was not so good! As well -- if I could give YOU more than 5 stars, I ALSO would!!  Only thing -- I feel a bit bad that you came ALL the way to Europe, and ended up staying with CANADIANS!!! hahaha.... But, on the other hand, it's nice to have a bit of 'home' with you when you are travelling!  We would LOVE to see you again -- next time you come to Europe, even if it's not Amsterdam, let me know, maybe we can have a beer! And thanks for explaining the origins of a ""dutch oven"" - hahaha... Hey, I'm so sorry, I didn't thank you for the cool gift you left us -- it is so our style!!  We loved having you here, and wish we could have spent more time with you.  Next time you come, you will see the picture you left us on the wall. It is awesome!<br/> this was a kid that tried to book the room and bring a friend, even though it was only booked for 1 person. so he has left a horrible review in some sort of ""revenge"" for having to pay for the 2nd person. I hope this child is happy that he got to make a bad review.  If that makes him happy, cool, a ridiculously bad review doesn't hurt me. I wish him good luck:) So kowkow i hope i spel it right was a wonderful guest. What a nice feel/look into a different culture. She needed an extra day so ended up on our couch. <br/>Definitely a guest I would have again and recommend her to all Thank u shariq! Bless u and good luck! :) We had an emergency and nobody could be at the house to change the bed. This is why we left you new sheets for you to change the bed and refunded you some of the money for the incovnvenience. You were also a WONDERFUL guest!! So glad you had a good time! I gave you 5 stars, as you were a 5 star guest! :) Sorry for your experience Karla!! You kind of snuck out of the house without talking to us!  Had you done so, I would have made the house non-smoking ( I had had  some family visiting me the day before from overseas, and they were heavy smokers, so I apologize for that).  I always am happy to accomodate guests if I am  approached with an issue -- being direct solves problems!  And just to be clear, the picture of the room on AirBNB is exactly the same as the room (I do not understand how you felt it inaccurate). As for the bed, great news, we have a new bed coming in a couple of days -- I have never had complaints about it before -- however I wanted a bigger bed for the room. I am sorry it did not suit you. People in Holland, particularly Amsterdam, live in very small flats - so unfortuantely you can hear other people moving in the house.  As well, as for street noise, I am located in the center of Amsterdam -- even though I live in a residential area, living in the center of any major city is bound to have city noises. My place is for people who want to be in the city center, close to everything, and would rather not stay in a hotel, for whatever reason that may be, whether it be financially, or to really experience a Dutch home. As for the hot water maker, it probably just needed to be plugged in (I don't drink coffee or tea, only have it for guests).  My cousin Liina was on the couch -- it was 8 am, and she was just hanging out, waking up on it.  Again, this is a house, not a hotel, and as much as I try to keep my life not in the way of guests, it is bound to happen sometime.  I am sorry this guest had a bad time -- most people have a great time at my place! But, its impossible to please everyone!! Sorry about the situation Tina -- I am normally here, but was away for 2 weeks in Egypt so had a family member watch the place.  If someone has a problem with smoke we don't have a problem having smoking outside. We don't really like the house to smell smoky either. The bedrooms are smoke-free, and we have 2 rooms that we rent, so it's not a hostel.  Again, sorry about that and hope you had a fun time in Amsterdam! I apologize Natalia for being difficult to contact-- I was in Egypt on holiday at the time and was told that my hotel would have wifi, but that was not the case.  Normally I am able to respond to people quickly and easily.  My cousin was running the house while I was gone and I sent her phone number to all the guests that were coming during my time away, but perhaps you didn't  get this message or u used the number that AirBNB automatically gives which is my cell -- which didn't work in Egypt!  My apologies for that! Thank you for staying with us, and I hope you had a great time!  puu puu puu, i said poo poo poo poo i said no no no... etc.... hahahah Hey Murilo (it was his wife that booked for him) -- we welcomed u to our place super late in the night (like 1 am or so), so I think that is something important to mention! Sorry if the bathroom wasn't always perfect -- we clean it daily, however I can't control how the other guest leaves the bathroom after they have used it. I'm sorry if it wasn't as clean as you like -- often the other guest may leave their items in the bathroom, or maybe they shave and it is impossible to keep it perfect all the time, as this is our house, and not actually a hotel!  One of the downsides of AirBNB I guess!!  If you had had a problem with the bathroom we would have gladly cleaned it for you -- we are ALWAYS happy to accomadate any guest requests!! i totally agree with you about the trash can!  We have one in the other room, and I went to go buy one last week from the store where we buy those types of things, but they were sold out.  But I TOTALLY agree -- the trash can is a necessity, and we will put one in.  Hey Jake, Thanks for the lovely review!! Sometimes we do smoke in the living room -- but NEVER in the rooms that we rent out, just so people know!   Yeah, sorry, I'm still trying to teach my cousin how to close doors quietly!!"

We will always welcome you with us! We loved hosting you and will always welcome you back here! Thank you for your feedback. I'm glad you found the location convenient, appreciated the suggestions I shared, and had a relaxing stay overall.<br/>For clarity: the room is listed as a private room with a king-size bed, as shown in the photos and description. It is not a ""single room"" in size or furnishing, though it is intended for individual or couple occupancy.<br/>This is a homestay with shared common areas ( library, first floor landing and the front door entrance), and that is clearly noted in the listing. The washer and dryer are available as a paid laundry service only, not for guest self-use, also mentioned in advance.<br/>I was happy to assist with the many questions you had before and during your stay ‚Äî I always aim to ensure guests feel well-supported. I do, however, kindly ask all guests to take care of the home. In this case, a significant amount of water was spilled on the wooden parquet flooring, which required extra attention after your departure. Thank you for the good review! Jullie zijn natuurlijk weer van harte welkom! I loved having you as our guests, so nice and open absolutely fantastic Thank you very much for your kind review and we look forward to your next stay with us!

Maybe we will welcome you again next year? It was a joy hosting Matthieu and Krystal. They are always welcome back here. I'm sorry that you experienced your time in our Airbnb this way. The room had a few heating options, which I explained as well. The air conditioner functions as a heater to warm the room, alongside the central heating in the room and bathroom. There was even a wool blanket available, so it is unfortunate that you felt your experience didn't live up to your expectations. Dear Elizabeth, thank you for your feedback.

It was a pleasure hosting you both, you are more than welcome to stay again!! Thank you Andriy for your kind words. It was a pleasure hosting you! Het is jammer dat Marianne een vier sterren waardering heeft gegeven want bij haar vertrek vertelde ze uitermate tevreden te zijn en een 5 sterren waardering te zullen geven. Tijdens haar aanwezigheid heeft ze geen enkele keer gezegd dat iets niet in orde was. Haar kamergenoot heeft beaamd dat alles geweldig was en ze was zeer tevreden. We do ask our guests as a matter of courtesy, usually several times during their stay, whether everything is all right or whether they have any remarks or complaints. Felipe did not say anything about a complaint during his stay at our house.<br/><br/> Sophie had asked me permission to go into our living room. I had told her that I did not want that because it is private. Using my son in my absence as an excuse and make pictures of private belongings is not what I expect from my guests.<br/>"
32134447,"Thank you Mark for this beautiful review, one little note on your review for future guests: there are two cats in the apartment, but it's not a 'cat house', since they can also go outside whenever they want (and there is no cat litter box).    "

How nice, Kartik, to read your positive and enthousiastic response. I am very happy to hear thar you have enjoyed your stay here.  You will be welcome anytime. Warm greetings, Mieke Ewa, you were a lovely guest to have. Thank you for your kind words and I am really very happy that you all enjoyed Amsterdam and the stay in my appartment. Thank you for leaving it so neatly. You will always be welcome again, Mieke Dear Ben, you are an exceptionally pleasant, sympathetic person.  Wish the world was fuller with guys like you. Mieke Thank you very much for your kind review, Kieron. You will always be welcome, Mieke merci camille pour ta gentille reaction. Thank  you for your positive reaction.  I am glad to hear you enjoyed your weekend.<br/><br/>Could you please tell me where in the bathroom it was not clean. The whole bathroom had been thoroughly cleaned before you arrived. Imreally find a clean house/ bathroom very important.  Sorry if you experienced it differently. Le four a ete nettoye par la femme qui nettoie. Je n'ai pas controle, sorry! <br/><br/>En ce qui concerne le 'checking out': je vous ai envoie un message et je vous ai dit que vous pouvez rester a la maison jusqu'a 11 heures moins le quart. Normalement c'est dix heures. Je croyais que j'avais dit que je serais a la maison vers 11 heures, mais pas pour pouvoir vous voir. Ce n'est pas necessaire que je suis la. Je suis decue que vous faites ces points negatifs, tandis que moi, j'ai du rester a la maison beaucoup plus longtemps que vous avez dit au debut.  Je n' ai pas pu diner avec mes enfants a cause de cela, mais je n'ai pas fait des complaints, malgre votre arrivee beaucoup plus tard. Dear Anthony,  I am so happy to hear that you enjoyed you stay in my appartment.  It is so nice coming back to my home and then notice people really took care of it.  Hope you saw many beautiful things in Amsterdam and its surroundings.  Take care, Mieke I am so glad that you enjoyed your stay in my appartment, Gil. Learned a new word, by the way...pristine!! Take care, Mieke Thank you for your review Daniel.  I am, however, quite surprised with your comment about the kitchen.  It was certainly not very dirty, like you suggest. Nobody ever complained about the house not being clean.  <br/>I have been kind to you when I wrote about my experience with your stay:<br/>Two lovely (white)  towels I have to throw away.  They are full of make-up!<br/>The house smelled of cigarettes when I came in because of an open plastic bag with all the cigarettes rests.<br/>Found potatoe chips on the floor.<br/><br/>But you know, I have accepted all that and did not mention it.  I took a lot of  trouble to have the house really clean, so you understand perhaps my disappointment. Goodbye Dear Vasily, I hope you can read my reaction. I cannot read yours, because it is not in English...hope you enjoyed everything and so nice your flowers!! Thank you so much for these compliments. I really appreciate them.<br/>Good to hear you enjoyed your stay. Goodbye. merci tiphaine pour tes mots gentils! Merci pour ces gentils mots, Milena. J'espere que votre retour era plus rapide que l'aller. Peut-etre on se rencontrera un jour... Lovely words, Jennifer. Thank you! Good to hear, Joel, that you enjoyed your stay. Lahja, dank voor jouw positieve reactie. Het was a pleasure having you. Geraldine, it has been a pleasure having you in my house. Thank you so much for your warm words.  You are always welcome again. Take care, Mieke Shirin, thank you so much for your positive response.  I'm really happy you enjoyed your stay.  It has been a pleasure meeting you.  Always welcome again. Cher Julien, cela me fait tellement plaisir de lire vos mots gentils.  Merci √† vous. Vous √™tes vraiment un couple tr√®s aimable et sympathique. Gabriel,  the add says quite clearly that you rent one room and share the bathroom.  I wonder why you would want  to use the living room. I wonder also what the problem is getting water in the bathroom and not in the kitchen.  It is the same water!!  I give you the opportunity to make your own coffee and tea, which is an extra service I do not need to do. I hope you liked the Dutch specialty  cookies I put in your room. <br/>I do not walk into your room, what privacy would I have if my guests could just walk in.<br/>Nobody complained about this before, while the room has been rented at least a hundred of times.<br/>A shame you left without saying goodbye. Hartelijk dank voor jouw zeer positieve reactie,  Andreas.  Het was een genoegen jou als gast te hebben. Je bent altijd zeer welkom.  Groeten, Mieke It was a great pleasure meeting these 2 elegant, kind, social ladies.  Hope to see them again. Thank you so much for your kind words, Savannah.  It was a pleasure for me having you and your husband. Take care. Theresa,  I am happy to learn that you and Tina enjoyed your stay. You were perfect guests and you will always be welcome again here.Thank you and take care. Emily, thank you so much for your positive and kind reaction.  I am very pleased that you both enjoyed your stay. You were perfect ""guests"". Take care. thank you so much for your lovely words.  it has been a pleasure having you. Thank you, Zhiyao,  for your kind words and review. Grazie, Alberto, per le tue bellissime parole, le cui mi rendono felice. Sono contenta che il vostro soggiorno vi √® piaciuto. Forse ci vediamo una prossima volta. Danke sehr,  Kim. Ich habe unseren Kontakt und unsere Kommunikation auch seht geschaetzt. Du, und deinen Freuund werden immer sehr willkommen sein. It was a pleasure having you, Eva. Thank you so much Gabriela,  for your kind reaction.  Good luck in life and you will be welcome again. Ich bin froh dass Ihr eine guten Zeit hatten. Immer willkommen. Thank you for staying with me, Cheng. Have a lovely 2019. I  am so glad Brandon, that you enjoyed your stay. Thank you so much and take care. You are such a lovely couple. Thank you so much for your sweet words. You will always be welcome again,  Jinny.  Good luck in London. Thank you for your nice words Anika. I wonder what you mean with the rooms are sensitive.  My house is only used by me, and I do not think I make a noise, nor do I hardly have neighbours.  Thank you Danny for your kind words. Vittorio, although you gave some positive remarks, I found your review rather negative.  If you should have read the advertisement better, you should have known that you rented a room (is so much cheaper) and not the appartment (is twice as much).  Nowhere in Amsterdam you can have a whole appartment for the price you paid.  I have 2 advertisements: 1 for one room, and 1 for the whole appartment.  How come you think you could chill in the living room and eat there????  Such a shame you give this kind of feedback.<br/><br/>Then the distance: like I told you there are many city centres: the Jordaan is only 10 minutes by bike and tram from me,  the Central Station and the ferries and the Dam: only 16 minutes by tram, the Rembrandtpark: 5 minutes walk, Vondelpark: 20 minutes walk, 10 minutes cycling, etc.  <br/>You now make it seem as if the centre is 30 minutes away....Peccato! Thank you for your nice words. Amsterdam has different centres. I am close to the Jordaan and 15 minutes by tram to Centraal Statiom, around which is another centre. 10 minutes by bike to Vondelpark,  4 minutes to Rembrandtpark.  depends a lot where you go. I am glad to hear you enjoyed yourselves, May and Euken, take care Thank you Brian for these positive words. Dear Ioana, thank you so much for these very warm and positive words. You are really a lovely and warm person.  You will always be welcome again. Take care, Mieke Dear Julian and Sarah, you are such a lovely couple. I wish you all the luck in the world. Thank you for your positive and warm words.  Dear yasha, thank you for your reaction. <br/>As far as the distance to the centre: Amsterdam, like many cities has different centres, like The Jordaan ( which is only 10 minutes by tram or bike),  the Dam (which is 15 minutes by tram or bike), the Pijp ( which is 20 minutes by bike and 25 minutes by tram),  around the Eye in the north, take a ferry, while Vondelpark ((through Rembrandtpark) and Museumsquare are only 10 minutes by bike and is a lovely road to go.   <br/>The wifi you did not ask for the first day, but of course would have been available.<br/><br/> Dear Jason and Zoe, well, how kind, your reaction.  Thank you both so much. What a wonderful couple you are.  I really wish you two a warm and inspiring life together. I am glad you enjoyed your stay so much.  Hope I ' ll see you again one day, Mieke Thank you Clare, for the complimentary words.  I am happy you both enjoyed<br/>your stay.  Good luck, Mieke Thank you for staying with me. Goodbye and hope to see you again. Thank you, dear Irene, for your kind words, I feel flattered.  Good to know how you enjoyed your stay in Amsterdam.  Danke schon fur die liebe Worter.  Auch ich habe mich sehr gut gefuhlt mir<br/>ihrem Besuch.  Danke auch fur das Schokolat. So nett! Vielen Dank, Anne und Mario.  Es war ein Vergnugen Sie hier zu haben.  Vielen, Vielen Dank fur die schonen, weissen Blumen.  Welch ein Uberraschung, so lieb von Ihnen.  Hat ich nicht erwartet. <br/>Es war 'a pleasure'  um Sie hier zu haben. Wiedersehen.<br/> Merci Floriane pour vos mots si gentils.  Je suis contente que vous ayez contents de votre sejour ici.  C' etait vraiment agreable de vous avoir chez moi. Dear Aysen, Thank you very much for the positive response.  I am glad you<br/>enjoyed your stay.<br/><br/>I understand you would like more space in the kitchen, but I rent the room without<br/>cooking or breakfast, and offer hosts the possibility to make their own.  What<br/>exactly do you mean by 'more space in the kitchen""? More chairs, more room<br/>in the refrigerator, ??? Dear Olga, Thank you so much for your enthusiastic and very warm words.  It was<br/>really nice meeting you and hope your life will continue in the positive flow you<br/>are giving it.  Goodbye, Mieke"
32698432,The measurements are actually exactly as described in the advertisement. I have even mentioned the measurements of the bed below the pictures of it. It is good you mention it because it shows it can actually be worth the effort to fully read what I have put down in my advertisement for my guests. I put it there for a reason.
33037959,It's the second time i host Lewis and again everything went perfect. Very good communication and a very friendly guy. Left the house prefect and clean! Totally recommend him to other hosts. Just prefect! 
33116110,"Thank you Sophie for the recommendation. Was nice having you! Danke sch√∂n, it was great having you!  Hi Magnus, I noticed you moved the bed and I could see what you mean regarding dust. I have cleaned it right away; good point! Thank you guys, was great having you! All the best,<br/>Jacqueline, Sylvester & Lola üêæ"
33132277,"Hello Sandra,<br/>How sad to hear that you‚Äôve had such an unpleasant stay with us.<br/>It is the first bad review in 8 years for us‚Ä¶.. so this sure has my attention!<br/>The noise is something we cannot do much about.<br/>It is a bit more noisy during hot summer days,because the terrace next door.<br/>That is clearly no problem for most of our guests. We don‚Äôt have much complaints about this.<br/>We have mentioned in our listing that it can be noisy some times because it is in the centre of Amsterdam.<br/>The bathroom however, is really bad news for us‚Ä¶. We where on holydays ourselves and asked a friend taking care of our Bnb during our holydays. She seemed not to have reached our cleaning levels. <br/>I do apologize for that.<br/>Now the bathroom is superclean again ( you where right it was not clean! it took me some hours scrubbing). For the noise i will put earplugs in the room‚Ä¶. and hoping for less beautiful weather.<br/>Kind regards Tanja Hi Vera,thank you for telling us about the mouse.<br/>Now we could take precautions imidiately! I am very sorry though, that you had a bad night. It seems to be rather common though, mice in the old houses of Amsterdam. Anyway we sure took action after your remark. we think it won't happen again.<br/>kind regards Tanja and Magnus"
33214578,"Did you use the thermomat? Merci Noelle for your kind words,<br/><br/>PM: If you would have asked I would gladly have provided the toaster! Hi Greg, thanks for your comments. It is good to get information on making the Studio as good as possible. I will start working on your suggestions! The dripping was solved as soon as possible. As it turned out the tennant above had installed a washing machine wrongly. I have placed some more storage possibilities. I hope to install it at 2 july! The provider at last sended the information and tools. Thanks for renting the studio."
33296083,"Hi Varun,<br/><br/>Thanks for your kind review and suggestion. You could use everything, also the towels. Normally Marlen leaves towels on the bed, but maybe she forgot. Sorry for that. You could use evrything in the house, also everything in the kitchen. We'll make it more clear to future guests. Thanks again! Best, Jorgen"
33497309,"Merci Patrice, Marie, Ruby le petit chien et vos fils. Vous √™tes des visiteurs tellement aimables, bien organis√©s et impeccables. En plus Ruby est adorable. Merci pour avoir choisi l‚Äôappartement-ci pour votre s√©jour en Amsterdam üôè Hi Hubert, I am sorry to read how disappointed you are with the accommodation. I regret it deeply as that is certainly not anyone‚Äôs idea of their holidays. As you can read from other comments, people have enjoyed staying at the flat quite a bit. The flat hasn‚Äôt changed. I happily live in it with my daughter. And as much as I know other guests are happy with it too. But having said that I apologize deeply the flat didn‚Äôt meet your expectations and I hope you have still enjoyed Amsterdam. <br/>There‚Äôs no sofa. The front room is empty as it is used for yoga when I am in the flat and as a 3rd bedroom when guests prefer to have a third bed. <br/>The balcony has a chair which per its style is vintage and other than that it holds pots of blooming flowers I take care of. The ‚Äòbuilding material‚Äô consists of 2 large tiles which I prefer not to throw away but didn‚Äôt find their purpose yet. <br/>There‚Äôs 4 sockets in the house which don‚Äôt work and generally speaking, the building is built in the 1920‚Äôs. It certainly isn‚Äôt brand new. As mentioned in the description the woodwork needs painting and a bedroom wall needs repair. <br/>However the flat has double glass windows, new bathrooms, a new kitchen, wooden parquet floors and nice carved ceilings. <br/>But having said all this to my defense it really isn‚Äôt anyone‚Äôs idea to be disappointed with their holiday accommodation nor is it my idea to host unhappy guests. <br/>Therefore I thank you for leaving this review as to avoid having other guests with expectations that will not be met. <br/>I wish you a beautiful day. <br/>Warm regards,<br/>Reina You are awesome Eva. Very good note about the broom. There will be a new broom soon üòä You‚Äôre very welcome! Thank you Chris for your wonderful review Chere Karine, merci beaucoup pour avoir pris le temps pour laisser une commentaire. Je suis desolee que l'appartement ne conformait pas a vos attentes. <br/><br/>En la description sur le site web de Airbnb je souhaite dessiner une image accurate du logement. Je m'excuse sincerement qu'apparemment je n'en suis pas reussie. <br/><br/>Il dit dans la description surle site web d'Airbnb que l'appartement n'est pas une espace toute a faite correctement arrange, qu'il n'y a pas un sofa ni une television. <br/><br/>Quand meme je suis desolee. J'ai l'habitude que les visiteurs sont heureux avec ce qu'ils trouvent ici a leur arrivee. <br/><br/>L'appartement se trouve en pleine centre d'une ville avec a peu pres un million d'habitants. Bien sur ce n'est pas un endroit pour etre en toute serenite. Quand meme tous les fenetres et aussi les portes qui donnent sur les petits balcons, sont fournies de vitres doubles. Pour moi ca attenue le bruit de l'exterieure tellement que j'arrive a bon dormir et meme a mediter tranquilement. Je suis desolee qu'on ne partage pas la meme experience. <br/><br/>L'odeur forte etait revolue au moment de mon rentree. Je m'excuse pour la gene. Une odeur mauvaise n'est vraiment pas agreable. Jamais je l'ai experimente. Donc c'est de la vraie malchance que vous l'avez du subir.<br/><br/>Le prix de l'apartement est fixe. Je ne roule pas avec la maree du demand et de l'offert. Le prix est considerablement plus bas que des logements comparables autour d'ici. Le prix est reduit parceque moi meme je pense que le manque de finitions et le minimalisme de decor ne gagnent pas des etoiles d'allure.<br/><br/>Apres avoir dit tout cela, je vous assure quand meme que je vous entends. Desormais j'espere que d'autres 'futurs' clients vont profiter de votre commentaire et qu'ils se rendraient compte que l'apartement est rudimentaire et ne servit plus que comme  un port de securite dans une ville bien animee.<br/><br/>Ca me fait vraiment du plaisir que vous ecrivez d'avoir, malgre tout, bien apprecie le sejours.<br/><br/>Je vous souhaite encore un bon bout de l'ete.<br/><br/>Cordialement, Reina<br/><br/>&lt; L'ecran de l'ordinateur-ci ne supporte pas les signes de ponctuations francaises. Excusez-moi pour leur absence > Je vous remerci Fabien d'avoir pris le temps de laisser votre commentaire. J'espere que des futurs clients d'en profiterent. Je vous remercie sincerement pour avoir laisse derriere apres votre sejour l'appartement impeccablement propre. Vous etes un visiteur superbe. Thanks Sebastian. Great to hear. The house manual to send that beforehand already crossed my mind. Thanks for mentioning it. I will do that. Sorry about the mice... Be well! Hedya and family are perfect guests. Communication with them is good. My neighbors are happy. Our two little rabbits are happy. Hedya you are welcome anytime! "

And it was a pleasure to meet you both! <br/>Till next time!  Kind regards, Marionüòä Dear C√©cile, <br/>This is my honest answer on your review. <br/>Please read the listing and house rules before booking a room! <br/>You didn‚Äôt have to tell guest about how 'important it is that you can not cook hot meals‚Äô! Because guest knew this before booking!About what‚Äôs included and what not. <br/>You didn‚Äôt read the listing before booking I guess, otherwise you would know this in advance (but guest can use a microwave.) <br/>* You are the one who bought food for cooking and use my pans and start cooking hot meals, very late after 10PM<br/>My house rules stated: 'don‚Äôt use the kitchen after 10PM! While this is not allowed, not on my listing, you did! <br/>I didn‚Äôt mention very honest your behavior and not following my house rules in my review to you, for other guest to read, and I regret. <br/>Remember that guest book a private room!  And not a fully equipped private apartment included own kitchen to cook for these rate! Otherwise it would stated; ‚ÄòAPARTMENT‚Äô and not ‚ÄòPRIVATE ROOM‚Äô‚Äô!  <br/>I know the rates in Amsterdam are high. You paid 14 euro below the airbnb advice rate, compare my other airbnb friend on the corner my rate has been much too low all the time. Please read the listing and house rules before booking a room!  <br/>Wonderful that you had a very good stay! <br/>Kind regards, Marion<br/>========================<br/>FRENCH : <br/>Ch√®re C√©cile, <br/>Voici ma r√©ponse honn√™te √† votre commentaire. <br/>Veuillez lire l'annonce et le r√®glement int√©rieur avant de r√©server une chambre ! <br/>Vous n'aviez pas besoin de dire au client qu'il est important de ne pas pr√©parer de repas chauds, car le client le savait avant de r√©server. Vous n'avez pas lu l'annonce avant de r√©server une chambre. <br/>Vous n'avez pas lu l'annonce avant de r√©server, sinon vous l'auriez su √† l'avance (mais le client peut utiliser un micro-ondes). <br/>* C'est vous qui avez achet√© de la nourriture pour cuisiner et qui utilisez mes casseroles et commencez √† cuisiner des repas chauds, tr√®s tard apr√®s 22 heures.<br/>Mon r√®glement int√©rieur stipulait Ne pas utiliser la cuisine apr√®s 22 heures ! Alors que cela n'est pas autoris√©, ni sur ma liste, vous l'avez fait ! <br/>Je n'ai pas mentionn√© tr√®s honn√™tement votre comportement et le non-respect de mon r√®glement int√©rieur dans ma critique √† vous, pour d'autres invit√©s √† lire, et je regrette. <br/>Rappelez-vous que les clients r√©servent une chambre priv√©e !  Et non pas un appartement priv√© enti√®rement √©quip√© avec sa propre cuisine pour cuisiner √† ce tarif ! Sinon, il serait indiqu√© ""APPARTEMENT"" et non ""CHAMBRE PRIVEE"" !  <br/>Je sais que les tarifs √† Amsterdam sont √©lev√©s. Vous avez pay√© 14 euros de moins que le tarif conseill√© par airbnb, comparez avec mon autre ami airbnb au coin de la rue, mon tarif a √©t√© beaucoup trop bas tout le temps. Veuillez lire l'annonce et les r√®gles de la maison avant de r√©server une chambre !  <br/>Merveilleux que vous ayez pass√© un tr√®s bon s√©jour ! <br/>Cordialement, Marion Thank you for your review Jacob!  I do my utmost best to send value information of what to see and where to eat cheap.You've booked a full weekend where price are indeed high, but compare to others, the rate you've paid was 16 euro cheaper! <br/>Wonderful that you enjoyed my accomodation and surrounding very good! <br/>Kind regards, Marion ENGLISH: I enjoyed your presence! Thank you Bernard and Sylvie! <br/>FRENCH: Merci pour vos compliments ! <br/>J'ai appr√©ci√© votre pr√©sence ! Merci Bernard et Sylvie !  <br/>Kind regards, Marion!  üôè üòä ENGLISH: <br/>Thank you for your compliment! Thank you very much Johanna and Mia for visiting me in my house, it was so nice to meet you both! Hope to see you more times! <br/>SWEDEN: <br/>Tack f√∂r din komplimang! Tack s√• mycket Johanna och Mia f√∂r att ni bes√∂kte mig i mitt hus, det var s√• trevligt att tr√§ffa er b√•da! Hoppas vi ses fler g√•nger! Thank you Gianluca! Kind regards, Marion I think they didn‚Äôt read the listing very well, the use of the kitchen stove to cook dinner, because she asked me. Upon request that night I replace their wardrobe/dresser in their room. I provide an extern heater for quick comfort after 10pm because he need a hot bathroom, he got a food poisoning. The guest who enter my house after they've left, had a warm room and bathroom. Of course there is a closed in their hallway, to leave the room as spacey as possible! There are also 15 hooks on the wall to use, which I point out with my finger when I show them everything! There are windows to refresh the air if needed. Of course guests should enter the front door of my house, which is obvious, and walk through the house (my 'one chair hair salon' and shared living kitchen) to their own private room. There is lighting in each room to turn on the light switch of course. If guests don‚Äôt ask me their needs or questions while here, I can‚Äôt help them to feel more comfy and relaxed.  I‚Äôm sorry to hear that despite my efforts at 10pm at night to make the room as comfortable as possible he decided to leave the next morning. Claudio's decision to decline my friendly offer to cancel the room as soon as possible the remaining days, so i could refund after rebooking surprised me. Thank you Lori for your review, as I said before: 'ask me if you need anything'.<br/>(And if there would be a problem, let me know as soon as possible! )<br/>Heat is everywhere, but you have to press/activate the heating button. <br/>The hallway has a closet/dresser. <br/>I LOVE to keep your private room as large and spacy!<br/>For Amsterdam Dutch standards, my kitchen is huge: 26 m2<br/>and mostly very tidy and allways clean.<br/>My listing said very clear:<br/>'Check in from 7pm-10pm, after my work time'. <br/>If you didn't want this, then don't book or complain afterwards.<br/>If you love to arrive earlier, ask me, I am reasonable women <br/>to welcome you into my house at daytime!<br/>During daytime I have to work! Afterwards I LOVE to chat with my guests!  <br/>Have good memories of Amsterdam! <br/>Kind regards, Marion Thank you Nathalie! Welcome next time! <br/>Kind regards, Marion Thank you Rob! Welcome next time! <br/>Kind regards, Marion Thank you Lorie! <br/>Kind regards, Marion Thank you Claire! <br/>Kind regards, Marion Thank you Jakub!

Thank you for your compliment! <br/>Kind regards, Marionüôèüòä Thank you for your compliment Niv! Wonderful that it felt as you own house! Thank you again for stay here! Warmly welcome next time!  Marion üòäüôè Thank you for your experience and your compliment! üòäüôè Dear Jean,  did I hear a little disapointing in you words? 'be aware of extras'.<br/>There is nothing to be aware of.  My answer was clear and you accept and agree the fee! <br/>At daytime my work time/ free time is not for free. Guest have a choice, or after my work.<br/>We communicate clear from start Jean! <br/>The fee you've paid is not only because I decline two hours of my worktime for you in the middle of the day, is not only for all suitcases and your bike to install at my home which you didn't told me in advance,<br/>but also to provide a warm welcome and all my info and advice. <br/>I know I do my utmost best for all of my guest which I invite personally in my private house! <br/>It is a service I could provide for my guest for a fee, I don't have to do so. It is a choice you have.<br/>* First page stated: 'Drop luggage/early arrival? a fee ask me' and you did! <br/>Your acting, words and happy smile shows a 5 stars overall. Thank you Jean!<br/>If you had any questions, you could ask me, (and not complain afterwards!)<br/>Maybe you expected a more impersonal Hotel.  <br/>Kind regards, Marion Thank you Lucy! I say the same, you are the perfect guests to host! I realy enjoy your stay!  Marionüòäüôè Lovely that you had such a wonderful time!

No Fernanda, don't make this up! You knew your review is not true! <br/>I am sure I did eveything to make your stay wonderful, till the very last day! <br/>Sad that you are not honest to me. <br/>‚òÖ- The point is: She don't want to pay for 'the damage bathroom door'! ‚Äî <br/>I was shocked and disappointed. Not mad, to see with your own eyes the problem, <br/>we talked about it friendly, in front of these bathroom door of what to do now.<br/>So: What happened? <br/>Fernanda had BLUE colored her hair.<br/>Which lost Blue color each time by washing the hair, <br/>(or simply her head on pillow sleeves, I pre-wash them before I wash them.)<br/>‚òÖFernanda blow-dried her hair in front the bathroom door, <br/>therfore the color dops flew on the the Bathroom door and has damaged the door, blue spots everywhere!  She was not careful enough to remove herself these blue spots directly after washing her hair. She could have done something after seeing these herself.<br/>‚òÖ Because I saw it after she have left the very last morning, <br/> I call her back to see herself, and she admits that it's bad. <br/>‚òÖ I've tried for 3 days to remove these Blue dots by cleaning and 96% alcohol, unfortunately nothing helps!<br/>‚òÖ And I am not waiting for any extra cost for me/or for her, to be honest! <br/>(No time to re-paint now, I have guest all the time.)<br/>She must realize that herself, that I did my utmost best to remove them myself. <br/>I am really disapointed that this has happened to me and her! <br/>‚òÖTherefore I ask a painter: 'how much does it cost to re-paint the door?'<br/>To search for a painter and call them and ask them it cost me also very much time.<br/>Because not easy to find a painter who make time for only painting 1 door! <br/>‚òÖAnd because of this damage, she don‚Äôt want to pay for her damage,<br/> she gave me an 3 Overall trip rating! Which is not fair at all.<br/> I always receive 5 stars from my guests. <br/> What a shame! Hope she got more carefully in future. Thank you Qianzhi for the detailed review! It was a pleasure to host you both! Warmly welcom again! Thank you so much, it was a pleasure hosting you both! You are so kind  and respectful. Thank you for asking all these questions you had!

Thank you Katie-Jean!<br/>Little hint: I have plenty of soaps, showergel, shampoos and conditioners! I have plenty of toiletries!<br/>I have two full kabinets full of soaps & toiletries! Because I have a Hair salon!<br/>‚Ä¶ And because I have a hairsalon:<br/>Hair by Nature,  I always have toiletries! Also for all of my guest!  <br/><br/>Toiletries you find in the bathroom! <br/><br/>( A little hint:<br/> Best is to reach out to me<br/> if you need anything while you're here.) <br/>  <br/>Kind regards, <br/>Marion After reach out and call airbnb about it, I am leaving you an honest review Tina! However I regret that Tina didn't reach out to me while she was here, I didn't get reponse on any of my questions the last day she where here.I love clear and honest communication.She hide her thoughts.I explain Tina 'Why‚Äô I didn't charge her anything at all. Not at arrive and Not when she left the house.No penny at all..at the time you booked my room 20 euro under the price of the room, I did YOU a favor, to book the room cheaper then it actualy cost,because the separate cleaning fees saves YOU as my guest‚Äô‚Äô airbnb fees over the total rate of the room that time, ( but it didn't work out like that) I didn't asked it at arrive, so in fact You saved 20 euros! And I lost 20 euro of the room rate in fact! That‚Äôs how it was Tina! To be honest I should have asked you the normal rate that time,( the room inclusieve the cleaning cost! ) But I didn't!‚Ä¶.  YOU are the lucky one, with a discount of 20 euro! But you blame me for THINGS I DIDN‚ÄôT DO! ??? And I didn‚Äôt change my 'far to low rate' that time or cancel the room ( I could have do that, but didn't ), because I love to meet all kind of guest in my life! Even with a tight budget! Remember? Well, 'I took my loss of 20 euro! And I get shit from you after all! I don‚Äôt deserve this Tina! Why so hypocritical? You got the cheapest room rate of the month my dear! And all I get from you is an arrogant ignoring face, no worth at all, and no eye contact at all. And no handshake at the door! So unpolite! None! WHY? What did I do wrong? What it did to me? ..Well, it took all my energie, ..and it took me three full days of my time,to lower my angryness a bit, to inform airbnb about the FAKE PASSPORT NUMBER, to call them, to inform them, and asked them what to say in a review about YOU! Don‚Äôt you be a shamed about it? You mention in ‚Äôyour honest review‚Äô what you had to say, yes you did. But, don‚Äôt make me laugh Tina! You where the one who are not honest! Given a false FAKE name and passport number in my registration book, it‚Äôs disgusting! I never met these behavior in my life! I have to take MY responsibility for all of my guest each time, and to the Tax authorities, which I must given ALL my numbers of guest and their passport numbers and names in the house, and pay for you my taxes /VAT as well. And YOU have to take yours!The book, in which I always keep track for the tax authorities,which is normal in this country when book a room! What a shame that you lied to me! REMEMBER: When book at airbnb, you agree the house rules! But you denied them!<br/>I gave you my review now, Yes, READ and learn from it. Don‚Äôt judge that quick your opinion before check things out, and don‚Äôt add fake information in a government book! That‚Äôs so rude! Better check things out first, while here, instead afterwards in a review, before escalate like these, and receive what you deserve! '''The best‚Äô''!<br/><br/>Well: first at all. <br/>1 ) -You've given me a FALSE NAME and PASSPORT NUMBER, for the tax authorities, which I have to declare when needed! I still wait for the real ones both of you! I don‚Äôt accept this at all!  Now I get real serious problems of you, they could have been avoid it! Don‚Äôt do this to me Tina, I still wait for the real ones Tina! Both of you! Find my name, my hair salon. 'Nature‚Äô.Hair by N  and send me these. <br/><br/>2 ) - Yes, you knew my bathroom and shower are small,I POST IT ON THE FIRST AIRBNB PAGE! Even all my guest knew when read the listing! You could read it in my listing BEFORE booking the place!So what‚Äôs the problem? I gave the best I have. I invest in the best! The very best highest FIVE STAR Hotel beds of  9.940,00 euros!!!! Yes, I did! The most beautiful and largest room of my house for my guest! I invest of the best! Floor heated as well everywhere,.oh,Sorry that I can‚Äôt make it bigger, brighter or whatever for a rate of 62 euros a night! Be happy for what you got in life! A high standard Hotel room, around my corner, has almost the same room, but smaller for 119,00 euros a night that date,with less comfort beds! And less high quality shampoo brands! So,don‚Äôt make me laugh about your complains like add some water in shampoo bottles! I have a lovely hair salon with clients from all over the world, and work with the very best Brands, and have cans full of them! <br/>'Why should I'?  <br/><br/>3 ) - other facilities unavailable,? No my dear, All my facilities are listed and are available for my guest, and if you had READ my Listing well, you knew this! <br/>Or ask me when you can‚Äôt find it. But you didn‚Äôt! So Why complain?<br/><br/>4 ) - other facilities unavailable, eg. kitchen You said. <br/>Well I can answer you short again:  YOU DIDN‚ÄôT READ my listing!<br/>There is NO KITCHEN TO COOK a Hot Meal! Very CLEAR in my listing, all my guest knew when read the listing!<br/>So why mention it when listed? You expect things which are not listed! When you had read my listing you had search and booked another room WITH kitchen instead book my room! But you didn‚Äôt! So, Why complain?<br/><br/>5 ) - provided soaps and shampoos ARE NEVER been mixed with water, <br/>        WHY SHOULD I ? I have cans full of shampoo! <br/><br/>6 ) -  I have NO Hidden charges at all. All is clear to READ in my listing! <br/>         YOU JUST HAD TO READ THEM BEFORE BOOKING Tina! <br/>         Your behavior is not that best, learn from it!<br/><br/>7 )- My Check in time, WHICH ARE CLEAR WHILE BOOK A ROOM, read first page, the listing on the airbnb website, to avoid misunderstanding afterwards like these! Or when ask me for an early check in and pay for my time! These service are my work or my private time! Remember? A choice guest have, they can‚Äôt demand my time, and they don‚Äôt have to? Up to you, you can choose for it or not! Don‚Äôt blame me for things I did‚Äôt ask for. I did not ask you any money at all, did I? N0, Not at all! Not at arrive and Not when you're left! Feel happy that you have the room for almost FREE! For such a low rate!  <br/><br/>8 - And no eye contact, at arrive, when I spoke, or when you leave, not at all,<br/>that made me feel like Garbage!  Rude and un-polite! Your attitude made me feel very uncomfortable, what did I do wrong? I gave you both the very best info I have! I gave you both the very very best I have! I don‚Äôt deserve this!<br/><br/>You don‚Äôt know half how lucky you are, to sleep in my room for that far to low rate! I invest in the highest 5star Hotel beds! Remember you slept on a hand made bed of 9.970,-euros!!!<br/><br/>I don‚Äôt want any problems, that‚Äôs why my listing is that long.To be clear for all guest! <br/>You had to read them, the house rules, otherwise you couldn‚Äôt book my room. <br/>You booked, so you agree! Then don‚Äôt act and blame me like shit, <br/>Like I did something wrong!<br/><br/>We didn‚Äôt spoke at all<br/>witch is a missed change<br/>to pull things right and stand<br/>before you had left and gone. <br/><br/>I reached out twice<br/>waiting for an answer<br/>or a handshake at the door<br/>and you flew out<br/><br/>no eye contact at all<br/>Which is a pity after all! <br/>Let stand me at the door<br/>speechless and unworthy<br/><br/>next time<br/>watch people in the eyes<br/>when spoke<br/>Let these be a lesson<br/><br/>These was a unpleasant <br/>experience <br/>for both of us! <br/>Long after you where gone<br/><br/>Yes, I wish you all the best!<br/>Al long life long, the best! <br/><br/>Remember:<br/>No eye contact at all, and No handshake at the door feels awful!<br/>I think for both of us.<br/>I even don‚Äôt treat a dog like this! <br/>Wish you all the best! Thank you Dafne!Merci becoup! I translate this text for my English guest. <br/> ""Marion's place is perfect for a good stay in Amsterdam!  <br/>Super comfortable, welcoming and she makes you feel welcome all the time. She left water, bread and biscuits, and from the moment I arrived she offered me some tea! Since I booked she sent me a lot of information on how to get there as well as places of interest! Excellent place with very good location "" YOU didn't 'detailed' mentioned above ABOUT 'YOUR HUGE MISTAKE' YOU MADE!!! <br/>I am still shocked!!!  I have written and say it in person, my house rules. <br/>( and you where agree with them. ) : <br/>*** ALWAYS LOCK MY FRONT DOOR !!! *** ALWAYS !!! .. <br/>I AM STILL SHOCKED!  YOU DIDN'T !<br/>Everyone could run into my house, and you where responsable for that. <br/>My house rules are as clear as water, before booking, guest knew, when they read.<br/>When guest are not agree with them, they can't book my room! Clear as water!<br/> So WHY book my room when you're not agree? <br/>You sneaky walked out of my house together, without gave me the house keys back and without pay me my service you've received! <br/>And THIS you didn't mentioned above in your review to me!<br/>A pity as you are not as 'datailed'' and honest as me, in your review above, <br/>about your behavior to me!  And to be honest in your writing! In your review above!<br/>I always be polite to all of my guest. READ OTHER REVIEWS below and above about me, from other guest. Could be more fair, could be more honest to tell the truth to my future guest that you talked with me on the street corner, because you where already two blocks away from my house, about other airbnb you had and their house rules. But that doesn't matter, it's not my business. My house rules are very clear, to avoid this kind of trouble, after, thats why I write so many words about, to be clear as water. And you knew that by booking of my room to be honest. You don't have to use extra services of ''luggage store at the last day (when guest are leaving' because I don't have to pay your holiday! I don't have to stay at home for you, it is a service from me when I do that for my guest..<br/>Therefore I ask some euros of my time. To stay in the house when guest come back.  <br/>You don't have to use my extra services when you're not appreciate to pay for that service,  when you're not agree my house rules.<br/>And sure I don't want a discussion on my street about 2,50 euro! .. Come on‚Ä¶<br/>That's why I reject the 2,50 euro, enjoy it! Because you couldn't miss it from the bottom of your heart. I want you to see happy! Thats why! I love honest people!<br/>And I felt strange for some hours after your left. I have nothing to hide! I didn't want to write this review because of this OPEN FRONT DOOR issue, but it is honest and my feeling.  I find your review an attack of me personally, and I regret this happens. And it is not true what you say above about the house rules. That why I write my experience with you here. My rate is low for what you recieve in my lovely huge house. My Flowers cost me sometimes more then your night rate! I love to share what I have with my guest. But depend of their attitude. A pity that you didn't appreciate of what you've received, and a pity that you didn't read my listing before by booking my room.  But that's not my misstake! <br/><br/>Yes, my rate could be some more if guest love to have the extra service, but they dont have to‚Ä¶  for example the laundry, or the early check at day time! In my work hours, or my free time. I have a life too!  I don't have to be home each hour all day for my guest! ( Do you?) Thats a service I offer. <br/>My Check in hours  are 18:00pm-22:00pm are written on the first page! Yes, thats right!   <br/>But, dont blame me when you didn't read them before..<br/>You have always a choice to use or not to use these service I offer for a reasonable price, even by delays some hours! ‚Ä¶ I leave it up to my guest to use my extra service or not.  To keep the rate low or pay some extra. There are plenty of airbnb rooms to rent.<br/><br/>A pity you didn't mentioned that YOU have left my house, without gave my keys back! Without Lock my front door!!! <br/>And I didn't hear a word of : '' I am sorry Marion', 'Apologize Marion'! <br/>An open front door!!! WOW!!!<br/>How would you feel and react when it happens to you Debbie?<br/><br/>I AM NOT AMUSED that YOU DIDN'T LOCK MY FRONT DOOR OF MY HOUSE by leaving!!!  I trust guest do all the time! <br/>It feels unsafe! You read this rule before booking! <br/>To be honest, I was totally shocked when I find out! Speechless! Still upset!<br/>When something was missing after you‚Äôre gone you had to pay me maybe more then four times the rate of the room when missing something out of the house, my shop! <br/>Do you understand what you did to me? You can‚Äôt do that in a big city as Amsterdam! <br/><br/>I knew I do always more then my best, to please others and treat others like myself.<br/>'Thank you Marion for your hospitality! <br/>I always hope that all of my guest ask what they need. Ask me what you're missing!<br/><br/>-'The ''make all your wishes come true HOTEL exist''!<br/>- 'You have slept on my BRAND NEW LUXE FIVE STAR BED  of 9800,00 euro! <br/>        ‚Äò( just to inform you that I 've invest my money into the room for my guest! <br/><br/>'You didn‚Äôt ask me all your wishes' - of 'what did you wanted from me' - I guess.A pity.<br/>And when you had done, read my listing, you knew all the answers before.<br/> <br/>You always may ask me anything. And I come down to help you. <br/>If you miss something, of stuff I have in stock elsewhere in my house, you could have ask me anything! Always! All items are there. But sometimes I love to chance or replace some small items. Alway ask me.. and not when it is to late.<br/><br/>Thank you for your review!<br/>I wish you all the best in life!<br/><br/>We both learned a lot.<br/> ÊàëÁöÑ‰ΩçÁΩÆÈùûÂ∏∏Â•ΩÔºÅÂÆΩÊïûÁöÑÁ©∫Èó¥ÔºåË±™ÂçéÁöÑÂÆ∂ÔºÅÁßÅ‰∫∫ÊàøÈó¥Âë¢ÔºÅÁßÅ‰∫∫Êµ¥ÂÆ§ÂíåÂç´ÁîüÈó¥‰∏∫Â•ΩÔºåÂπ∂‰∏∫‰ΩéÊàø‰ª∑ÔºÅ<br/>‰Ω†ÂæàÂπ∏Ëøê„ÄÇËÄå5 min.lopenÊ¢µÈ´òÂíåÂõΩÂÆ∂ÂçöÁâ©È¶ÜÔºÅ<br/><br/>ÊòØÂ∞èÁéâÂíåÂª∑¬∑ÊûóÔºåÊàëÁöÑÂÖ•‰ΩèÊó∂Èó¥ÊòØÈ¢ÑÂÖàÁü•ÈÅìÁöÑÔºÅ<br/>ÂØπ‰∫éÂ§ßÂÆ∂ÔºÅÂØπ‰∫éÊèêÂâçÊ£ÄÊü•„ÄÇÂπ∂Ë¶ÅÊ±ÇÂÜç‰∏ÄÊ¨°ÔºÅ<br/>È¢ÑÔºÅÊèêÂâçÈ¢ÑËÆ¢ÊàëÁöÑÊàøÈó¥ÔºÅ ...<br/>Â¶ÇÊûú‰Ω†Ë∑üÊàëÁöÑËßÑÁü©ÂêåÊÑè‰Ω†Âè™ËÉΩÈ¢ÑËÆ¢ÔºÅ<br/>Âπ∂ÂÅö‰Ω†ÁöÑÂ•ΩÔºÅ<br/><br/>ÈÇ£‰πàÔºå‰∏∫‰ªÄ‰πàÊèêËøô‰∏™‰ø°ÊÅØÔºü<br/><br/>Â¢ûÂä†‰∫Ü‰∏Ä‰∫õÊúâ‰ª∑ÂÄºÁöÑ‰∏úË•øÔºåÂà∞‰∫Ü‰πêË∂£Ôºå‰Ω†ÂñúÊ¨¢Ôºü<br/>Â¶ÇÊûúÊÇ®Ê≤°ÊúâÂú®Â∞èÁéâÊó©Ê£ÄÊü•Ôºå‰Ω†‰∏ãÂçà18:00ÂêéÂäûÁêÜÂÖ•‰ΩèÊâãÁª≠„ÄÇËøòÊòØËÆ¢‰∏çÂà∞ÊàëÁöÑÊàøÈó¥„ÄÇ<br/>ÂΩì‰Ω†ËÆ¢Â•Ω‰∫ÜÊàøÈó¥ÊàëÁöÑÊàøÈó¥ÁéáÈùûÂ∏∏‰Ωé„ÄÇ<br/>ÈöèÂú∞ÔºåÂú®‰ªª‰Ωï‰∏Ä‰∏™ÊàøÈó¥mooeieÈ≤úËä±ÔºÅËä±ÁöÑË¥πÁî®ÊØîÊÇ®ÊâÄÊîØ‰ªòÁöÑÊàøË¥πÂ§öÔºÅÊàëÁúüÁöÑË¢´ÂÆ†Âùè‰∫Ü„ÄÇÂ§™Á≥üÁ≥ï‰∫ÜÔºå‰Ω†‰∏çÁü•ÈÅìÊâÄÊúâÊúâÊ¨£ËµèÔºÅ<br/>¬†<br/>ÊâÄÊúâÁöÑ‰ø°ÊÅØÊòØÊ∏ÖÊô∞ÂíåÊòéÁ°ÆÊàëÁöÑÁΩëÈ°µ‰∏ä„ÄÇ<br/>‰ªª‰Ωï‰∫∫ÈÉΩÂèØ‰ª•ÈòÖËØªÊàëÁöÑÁΩëÁ´ô„ÄÇÁÆÄÁõ¥ÊòØÂ∑≤Áü•ÁöÑ„ÄÇ<br/>Áé∞Âú®ÊòØ4Êúà5Êó•ÊàëÊï¥Êï¥‰∏Ä‰∏™ÊúàË¢´ÈªÑÁâåË≠¶Âëä„ÄÇÊàëÁöÑ‰ª∑Ê†ºÊØî‰ª∑ÂÄºÊõ¥„ÄÇÂ¶ÇÊûú‰Ω†ËØª‰∫ÜÊàëÁöÑÂ•ΩÂà∂‰ΩúÁöÑAirbnbÈ°µÈù¢ÔºåÊàëÁöÑ‰ø°ÊÅØ‰ª•Â§ñÔºå‰Ω†Áü•ÈÅì‰Ω†ÂèØ‰ª•ÊÑâÂø´Âú∞ÂÅöÂá∫ÈÄâÊã©„ÄÇ<br/><br/>Â¶ÇÊûú‰Ω†Âπ≥Êó∂ÂÖ•‰Ωè18Èó¥Ôºö00-Êôö‰∏ä22:00ÂíåËá™Áî±ÔºåÂΩìÁÑ∂ÔºÅ<br/><br/>ÊàñËÄÖËØ¥Ôºå<br/>‰ΩÜ‰∏ÄÂ∞èÁ¨îË¥πÁî®Ôºå<br/>ÂØπ‰∫éÊàëÁöÑÁßÅ‰∫∫/Â∑•‰ΩúÊó∂Èó¥ÔºÅ<br/>ÊÇ®ÊâÄÂÅöÁöÑÈÄâÊã©ÔºÅ<br/><br/>¬†..EarlyË°åÊùéÊâòËøêÂèØ‰ª•ÂÅöÔºå‰ΩÜÊàëÈóÆÂÆÉ‰∏ÄÂ∞èÁ¨îË¥πÁî®ÔºåÂõ†‰∏∫ÊàëÊúâÊàëÁöÑÂ∑•‰ΩúËøúÔºåÂõ†Ê≠§Âú®ÈÇ£‰∏™Êó∂Âàª‰∏çËÉΩÂ∑•‰ΩúÊó∂ÔºåÊàëÁöÑÂÆ¢‰∫∫ËÆ§‰∏∫arriveren.SomsÂÆ¢‰∫∫Âª∂Ëøü„ÄÇÊ≠§Â§ñÔºåÊàëÂøÖÈ°ªÊúâÔºÅËøòÊòØÊàëÁöÑÁßÅ‰∫∫Êó∂Èó¥ÔºåÊàëÁöÑ‰ªªÂëΩÂú®‰∏ÄÂ§©ÁöÑÊó∂Èó¥Ôºå‰∏ÄÂ§©ÊàñËÄÖÊòØÊàëÁöÑÂÆ¢‰∫∫ÔºÅÂ∏åÊúõ‰Ω†ÊòéÁôΩÔºÅ<br/>....<br/>¬†YESÔºåËÉΩÂÅöÂà∞È¢ÑÂÖàÂ≠òÂÇ®ÁöÑË°åÊùéÔºå‰ΩÜÈúÄË¶ÅÊàëÁöÑ‰ºëÈó≤ÊàñÂ∑•‰ΩúÁöÑÊó∂Èó¥ÂíåÊàëË¶ÅÊ±ÇÁöÑË¥πÁî®„ÄÇ<br/><br/>ÈÄÄÊàøË°åÊùé‰πüÂøÖÈ°ªÊîØ‰ªò‰∏ÄÂÆöÁöÑË¥πÁî®Ôºà‰Ω†ÂÜô„ÄÇÔºâÔºöËá™ÁÑ∂ÁßëÂ≠¶ÔºÅ<br/>‰∏äÂçà10ÁÇπÂêéÔºåÂ•ΩÊúâÊÑè‰πâÔºÅ<br/>ÁÑ∂ÂêéÁ¶ªÂºÄÊàëÁöÑÂÆ¢‰∫∫ÔºÅ<br/>¬†ËøôÊòØÊàëÁöÑ‰∏ÄÊ¨°Âèà‰∏ÄÊ¨°ÔºÅÊàëÁöÑÁ©∫Èó≤Êó∂Èó¥ÔºåÊàñËÄÖÊàëÁöÑÂííËØ≠ÔºÅ<br/>¬†Ê≠§Â§ñÔºåÊàëÂú®ÂÆ∂ÈáåÊòØÁúüÊ≠£ÂõûÂÆ∂Âú®‰Ω†ÊåáÂÆöÂÆÉÁöÑÊó∂ÂÄôÔºÅ<br/>ÊàëÁúüÁöÑ‰∏çËÉΩËµ∞‰∫Ü......ËøôÊòØÊàëÁöÑÁßÅ‰∫∫Êó∂Èó¥„ÄÇ<br/>Êàë‰∏çÂæó‰∏çÊîØ‰ªòÂ∞ÜÊàëÁúüÁöÑÂêà‰πéÈÄªËæëÁöÑ‰∏ÄÂ∞èÁ¨îË¥πÁî®„ÄÇÊØïÁ´üÔºå‰Ω†ÂèØ‰ª•Ëá™Áî±ÈÄâÊã©‰ΩøÁî®„ÄÇËÄå‰Ω†Ê≤°Êúâ„ÄÇ<br/><br/>¬†‰Ω†‰πüÂèØ‰ª•Áî®Âú®‰∏≠ÂøÉÁ´ô - Êõ¥Ë°£ÂÆ§ÔºåËøôÊòØÈùûÂ∏∏expensive-„ÄÇ Ôºà‰Ω†Ê≤°ÈóÆÊàë„ÄÇÔºâ<br/>‰ΩÜÂêéÊù•ÊúâÈúÄË¶ÅÊó∂ÂÆ∂‰∏≠Êó†‰∫∫„ÄÇ<br/>¬†ÂÆÉÁöÑÊàêÊú¨ÊØîÊàëÊõ¥Ë¶ÅÊ±ÇÔºÅ<br/>Â∏åÊúõÊàëÁöÑËß£Èáä‰∏∫ÊÇ®Êèê‰æõÊ∏ÖÊô∞„ÄÇ<br/>Áé∞Âú®ÔºåÊÇ®Â∑≤Áªè‰∫ÜËß£Âπ∂ÂçáÁ∫ß„ÄÇ<br/>ÊàëÂæàÈ´òÂÖ¥Âú∞Ê¨¢ËøéÊÇ®Êàê‰∏∫ÊàëÁöÑÂÆ¢‰∫∫„ÄÇ<br/>ËÄåÊÑüÊÅ©Ôºå‰Ω†ÂñúÊ¨¢ÔºÅ<br/>‰πüÊÑüË∞¢‰Ω†Â∑≤ÁªèÁ¶ªÂºÄÂπ≤ÂáÄ„ÄÇ<br/>ÂÜçÊ¨°ÊÑüË∞¢„ÄÇÊ¨¢ËøéÂõûÊù•ÔºÅ Â§™Ê£í‰∫ÜÔºÅÂ∫´ËÇØÈúçÂ§´ÔºÅÈ¨±ÈáëÈ¶ôÁöÑÂ≠£ÁØÄÔºÅ<br/>ÂæàÈ´òËàà‰Ω†‚ÄúÂ∫´ËÇØÈúçÂ§´‚ÄùÈ¨±ÈáëÈ¶ôË≥ΩÂ≠£Â∑≤Á∂ìÁúãÂà∞‰∫ÜÔºÅ<br/>Ë∂ÖÁ¥öÈ´òËààËàáÊÇ®ÁöÑ‰ΩèÂÆøÔºÅÊÑüË¶∫Â∞±ÂÉèÂÆ∂‰∫∫ÔºÅ<br/>ÊòØÁöÑÔºåÊàëÊÉ≥‰Ω†„ÄÇ<br/>Ë∂ÖÁ¥öÊ≠°ËøéÔºÅ<br/><br/>T√†i b√†ngle!

Thank you for the nice stay and for the great time in our private boat. I will not forget that! Also great that you did the cycling. Hope to see you coming back to Amsterdam!<br/>Willem"
35262430,"thanks, Lea<br/>In Amsterdam it is not allowed to rent the house to more than 4 people, I'm sorry but these are the city rules. This is a non-smoking house. Because we are a non-smoking family so my neighbors are not used to 4 people smoking on my terras. thanks Migs,<br/><br/>You are more than welcome to come back;-)"
35316392,"Hi Nanna, het appartement beschikt wel degelijk over verwarming. De thermostaat hangt in de woonkamer. Groet Janine"
35411832,"Thanks for your lovely review Marissa! We‚Äôd love to have you back again soon! Thanks Tiina, glad our home was your home for a few days whilst we were away. Come again!"
35449652,"I do not recognize myself in that the place is not very clean.  As for old, yes, the place is original 1934. so that is reasonably old but I write that in the advertisement. Unfortunately we have mouse in Amsterdam, really a lot. Therefore never ever leave food outside as you did.<br/>Sorry you feel this way and sorry I had to hear it this way. I am super disappointed and offended by Veronica. This is my home that she is trashing and I do not recognize one thing she is writing. She could have contacted me while staying with me and she did not, says enough of the kind of person she is."
35704934,"Thanks for your review and that you so much liked the neighbourhood. This is indeed the most marvellous part of Amsterdam... So I very much agree!<br/>However your complaint about the sound because of - also for us unexpected - construction works (and which ended during your stay) is not really fair. That happens now and then in Amsterdam with all those old houses. You will notice that now you got your own house in a much busier part of Amsterdam... <br/>The problem with the warm water was very quickly solved after you informed me; as you wrote everything was 'working again just fine!'.<br/>Also not quite fair is your remark about the dust. I have to state that before your check-in the whole apartment was cleaned up thoroughly as usual. But since you let almost all 'top- and side-hinged' windows open at the top (also when absent at night) dust from outside could blow in continuously. In the meantime there was always a hoover available.<br/>But that said I thank you for your visit and wish you een fijn verblijf in Amsterdam met rustige buren, geen techische mankementen en een adequaat reagerende huisbaas;). Thank you, Stephanie, for your kind words.<br/>However, I have to make a small correction. Both at the time of your booking and now, it is in no way suggested that a (gas) stove will be present. The reason is that a stove in a B&B is strictly prohibited by the municipality of Amsterdam. Fortunately, I recently received permission - coincidentally during your stay - for a microwave. After consulting with you, I immediately installed a microwave in the kitchen. Moreover, I have added this to the list of 'amenities' (where 'stove' is missing...). In English: 'This is a great place to explore Amsterdam, a very kind hospitable host who will help you solve any problems and will be completely invisible to you. There were only positive impressions of the trip.'. <br/>Thanks Sergey.  I hope to meet you again!"

Dear Pedro and friends, thank you for the compliments. You are welcome to our house any time. Dear Becca, we are awfully sorry you felt your privacy was invaded. Strict policy of the Amsterdam municipality, however, does not allow us to put an extra door between the stairs and the basement, so we cannot comply to that suggestion. We had hoped that our description of the house prepared you for everything our house has to offer. We enjoyed your company a lot and hope to see you once more. Dear Fabia, thank you so much for your positive review. It inspires us to keep our standards high. Regards and as we told you: welcome any time soon.

We will save the date for the Amsterdam marathon in 2018 should you wish to ‚Äòmove in‚Äô again :) Alles Gute.  Dear Mads, Simen and Ismael. Thank you and enjoy your stay in Zwolle.  Dear Roger & Co.

36272714,"You are totally right: the stairs are steep ( normal for 19th century Amsterdam houses) so avoid packing large suitcases. Thank you so much! Do come again !! Dank je wel voor je compliment.

Hi Adrian, thanks, and you guys are very welcome to stay again! And we would be happy to have you as guests again! :)"
37658666,"Dank voor de mooie woorden! Fijn dat jullie hebben genoten.<br/>De gedeelde badkamer staat inderdaad meerdere keren vermeld in de beschrijving ‚Äî ik snap dat niet iedereen alles leest (doet bijna niemand), maar leg het dan ook niet bij mij neer üòâ.<br/>Hopelijk tot een volgende keer! The listing clearly states the bathroom is shared‚Äîplease read before you book (and blame me).<br/>Leaving a review like that is like going to a sushi bar and complaining there‚Äôs no pizza on the menu. The listing clearly states that the bathroom is shared with max. 2 others. Please make sure you know what you book. Thanks for the dramatic review.<br/>This is like going to a sushi place and complaining there's no pizza. The listing very clearly states there‚Äôs no kitchen‚Äîno microwave, no plates, no cutlery. It‚Äôs all there in black and white. You just didn‚Äôt read.<br/>What I offer is exactly what‚Äôs listed: a comfortable bed, a clean space, and a good location. No false promises. No surprises‚Äîunless you skip the description.<br/>So here‚Äôs a tip for next time: read the listing before booking. It‚Äôll save both of us the headache.<br/>Safe travels.<br/>P.S. The cold bathroom? Easily solved by turning on the heater. Thank you for your feedback. I want to point out that the ad states very clearly the bathroom is shared. <br/>Price & value are very subjective. Summer weekends are among the most popular of the year, though; try low-season next time. <br/>I think you are great too :)<br/>Ruben Thank you for your feedback. Yes the bathroom is shared, like it says in the listing.  If you want your own private place, please book a private place. <br/><br/>Light shining into the room is great feedback. I can work on that, thank you. Hahaha thank you for your review Josh! I do exist but I was working a lot so we missed each other. No worries, I am not a house ghost but a real person ;) we wish you the best! Puck Thank you for the kind words! Please let hosts know if you are cold. We would have been happy to supply extra blankets or turn up the heater. I reported this guest for using cocaine in my house. I found traces on not one but two tables. I made photos to back up my claim. In the above feedback, the guest states that the consumption of a  ¬¥¬¥green cigarette¬¥¬¥ led to me reporting the guest which is false. Thank you for your stay. I am sorry you had a bad experience. It is clearly written in the listing that the bathroom is shared. I recommend you to book an appartment instead of a private room in the future.<br/><br/>During check out I gave you more than an hour extra to check out without pushing you. After you left I cleaned the room and found an empty bottle of whiskey and marihuana(which is against the houserules), maybe that made check out a little bit more difficult for you. We wish you the best. Thank you for your stay.<br/>Just to clarify: the room does not have AC and this is clearly stated in the listing. If AC is important to you, please make sure to book a place that includes it.<br/>The bathroom is also listed as shared‚Äîthis is mentioned clearly in the description. If you'd prefer a private bathroom, I recommend booking a private setup next time.<br/>Thanks again, and glad you enjoyed the location and the comfy bed! The listing clearly states there is no kitchen. Please make sure you know what you book. The Bathroom is indeed shared. Please read the listing where this is clearly stated.<br/>Thank you for your feedback regarding the shower. I am aware of the problem and working on it. Thank you for your feedback. I‚Äôm glad you found the room clean and enjoyed the neighborhood. However, I want to emphasize that the listing clearly states that the bathroom is shared. <br/>It‚Äôs unfair to blame the host for something clearly mentioned in the listing. After not reviewing the details, complaining about the shared bathroom is like being upset that an Italian restaurant doesn‚Äôt serve sushi. Thank you for your feedback.<br/>The law prohibits me from servicing my guests with a kitchen and related amenities (long, tiresome, bureaucratic story).  I wish I could. Sorry for the inconvenience. Thank you for your feedback. Thank you for the kind words and great feedback. Sorry about the thee, I noticed the holder was empty the other day. I should have filled it up earlier. I got loads of thee downstairs, please feel free next time to ask about the thee. <br/><br/>I don't offer breakfast as mentioned in the listing. For all the other guests: ""Please be mindful that the room does not include breakfast!"" Hoi Hendertje! <br/>Vervelend dat de andere gasten net gebruik wilden maken van de badkamer terwijl jullie in bad zaten. We bieden onze kamer aan als een priv√©kamer met een gedeelde badkamer, dus dan kan dat gebeuren. We raden je aan om voortaan een appartementje of studio te boeken met een eigen badkamer, dan heb je dat probleem niet meer! <br/>Bedankt voor jullie verblijf en al het beste :) Thank you for the kind words and the invitation! It was great having you!"

Thanks again for being such a great guest!<br/>Nienke & Rick Hi Charlotte, thank you so much for the wonderful words! Hi Daniel, thank you so much for your positive feedback and review.

37904683,"""les wc situes dans la douche sont choquants""..  I have lots of friends over and I rent out my apartment 60 days a year. No one has ever, and I mean ever, complained about the smell. If you detect a bad smell in my apartment I think you should consider a job sniffing up truffles in Croatia or Italy. There's good money in that. Nevertheless I installed scent refreshers in the apartment after this comment, so I can never get a review like this again."
37920935,"Little suprised with your review and what you meant with 'it did not feel like an Airbnb'. I believe the main concept of Airbnb is were people sublet their place/room for visitors. Yes I do live there and your statement 'was everywhere' makes it sound like it was all over the place. My clothes were in my closet, the food was in the kitchen cabinets. Plus I did not realize you needed a whole closet to put away your stuff you had in your little bookbag . <br/>You didnt arrive to my listing until 1 am, which had negative influence to my program that evening, I allowed you to stay 3 hours longer when you checked out so you did not had to rush yourself in the morning. Upon check out you left all the lights on the house (not very environment friendly). <br/>Nevertheless hope you will more experiences meeting your expectations in the future. appreciate the kind words Tim and you are always welcome:) Heel erg bedankt voor je recensie en ik ben blij dat het jullie zo goed is bevallen. Ik doe altijd mijn best om te meer te leveren dan beloofd. Het gaat jullie goed en wie weet komen we elkaar in de toekomst weer tegen. Hi Georgannis, <br/><br/>Sorry to hear about the hot water, but it should last between 12-15 min normally. <br/>Noted about the towels and I will pay extra attention to it the next time.<br/>Regarding the TV I do not think it was not because it was not working but you needed some help to make it work:).<br/><br/>Thank you for your feedback, Thank you for your kind recensie Ammar. You are a great guest and always welcome to my place. You are respectful and treated my house as if it was yours...Much appreciated Thank you Rashid and you are always welcome:) You are always welcome to my apartment and thank you for being a great guest. Thank you very much for your feedback and I am glad I could contribute to holiday in Amsterdam. I am looking forward hosting you again in the future. All the best"

38661523,"well, i guess if you read this, it may seem like it is the worst place ever. <br/>please allow me to respond what happened. <br/>I had a new cleaner who had had not followed my instructions properly. She forgot to replace the sheets and did not empty the fridge.<br/>As soon as Olivia told me, I send her back again to fix the situation.  this is my responsiblity and it will not happen again, I can assure. <br/><br/>The rest of Olivia's story however is mostly false and made out of resentment and envy. She inmediately asked for the full refund. When I initially refused, she left the apartment and made a claim at Airbnb to refund the money. It took me a lot of effort, but eventually I won the case against her.<br/>She should have just stayed, as everything was fine when the cleaner came back to clean the fridge situation and made up the bed with fresh bedlinnen. <br/>Unfortunately it is 'Airbnb policy' that made it impossible to remove her review. <br/><br/>I take great care of my guests and try to make everyone feel as comfortable as possible. <br/>This lady however expected a 5 star hotel, where you can just get a full refund and book a new place when something is out of order.  And when i refused she set her mind to make up a completely unprofound fairytale. <br/><br/><br/>If you make a reservation at my apartment, I can assure you that<br/>- Everything is cleaned and well. <br/>- there are fresh bedlinnens, <br/>- fresh towels, <br/>- the smell is good, <br/>- the pillows are good. <br/>- you can use the portreplicator, monitors, tv, game cube, boardgames, books, laundry machine, everything will be fine and you will be able to enjoy your time in Amsterdam.<br/><br/>If you still hesitate, please scroll through all the other reviews to see what people say about the apartment. Hi Melissa, thanks for your comments. The 180 cm size mirror will be placed next saturday for all future guests ;-)"

You guys had fun in Europe. Dear Isabelle,<br/>Thank you for your feedback.<br/>Cheers Laura & Arjan Hi Jeff,<br/>Thank you for your lovely detailed review. Hope to see you again one day. Dear Mitchell,<br/>This review makes me smile :)<br/>Thanks and I am happy to read the experience for your overall stay. We always try to give the ‚Äúhome from home‚Äù feeling and hospitality service by nature. Thanks again. Cheers ! Laura, Chery & Arjan Dear daughter of Sean,<br/>Thank you for your message and we feel very sorry for the inconvenience you experienced. I run together with my husband and staff my business. You have booked a Bed & Breakfast with complimentary breakfast served in your apartment suite. After breakfast we always knock on the door and say hello  ( same as in a hotel ) to collect the empty basket and clean trash cans. This to keep the apartment suite clean and fresh during your stay. I thought you were out when I knocked on the door since it was 04:00 P.M. So maybe this part of regular cleaning was miscommunicated during check-in as we always give a proper briefing. Our only wish is to have happy guests staying at our Airbnb (with breakfast) who do experience a stay with nice complimentary hotel amenities. We are going to discuss this matter as a family team with high priority. Thank you ! Hopefully your overall stay was great since the apartment is very spacious and spring time in Amsterdam after COVID times is great. Cheers Laura Dear Alex, thank you for your lovely detailed review of your stay. We are happy to see you again one day. Enjoy summer. Stay healthy & safe. Post Covid times it is. Cheers Laura Dear Amy, thank you for your private feedback. Yes our cappuccino's are awesome and it's our standard procedure to explain you where you are and what directions are the most convenient. We hope to see you again one day. Cheers Laura Hi Bethany, thank you for confirming to have the home-from-home feeling at our place. Jordaan area is by far the most local experience you can get. If you make new plans, please book in advance since we are mostly full 3-4 months before your wish dates. Cheers Laura Thank Karen for your nice detailed review. Hope to see you again next summer. Cheers Laura Dear Matthias, <br/>Thank you for your nice review. We look forward to see you again. Cheers Laura Dear Cheryl,<br/>Thank you for your nice review and to share our downtown location on the map.<br/>Tulips from end of March till mid of May. Look forward to see you again.

Since you have travelled to Europe with end destination Amsterdam on this special occasion we could not let you go without breakfast because you needed to catch the train on time.<br/>So, you should really come back in summer time one day to discover the city and <br/>it's neighborhood. We have forest,dunes and beaches just 20/30 minutes away. <br/>Besides all, boating through the canals of Amsterdam is possible <br/>again since last Sunday. Spring/Summer season starts! Take care.

Laura Dear Thierry,<br/>Thank you for your review. We are sorry that we could not provide our bikes because the tires were flat of the bikes and we send them to the bike shop. <br/>We do offer them if guests reserve the bikes in advance. Regarding our boat, we can only provide/offer a ride during the spring/summer months. Hope to see you again one day to give you a complimentary boat ride. We are sorry if you have experienced some noise. Since the houses ( in the whole neighborhood ) are dated from 1657-1700 it can sometimes be a little noisy but that is a little bit the charme of the old neighborhood. Besides above points, I am happy that your overall first bed & breakfast experience was good and that you have enjoyed your stay. We always try to improve our services. Look forward to see you again one day. <br/>Warm regards, Laura Dear Gabriela, thank you so much for this lovely review.<br/>It gives us a very big smile on our faces.

Warm regards, Laura & Arjan Dear Vincent,<br/>Your review is awesome, it gives a big smile on my face.<br/>Always trying to create the additional value without guests paying for it.<br/>I do love to read that your Valentine weekend was a memorable one <br/>and that the apartment suite & my services was your cream on the pie.<br/>See u again one day!

39600914,"That is very nice. Thanks again for your lovely Words. Be so kind to tell me what is wrong with the cutlery Wat vervelend dat je geen spatels hebt kunnen vinden. Ook jammer dat je mij dat niet hebt verteld. Dan had ik je verteld dat er een in de la zit bij het bestek. Evenzo vervelend dat de spullen in de keuken niet schoon waren. Ook daarvoor geldt dat wanneer je dat zou hebben aangegeven zou ik het voor je hebben opgelost. Ik woon op de begane grond. Was afgezien van het feit dat het voor jou niet prettig was, had het snel opgelost kunnen worden.  Zelfde met betrekking tot de bovenburen had op dezelfde manier geregeld kunnen worden. Zijn erg aardige mensen die zich niet bewust zijn geweest van hun stemgedrag. Thanks for your lovely feedback. Ik zal met mijn schoonmaakster overleggen wat er misgegaan zou kunnen zijn. Excuses en bedankt voor de feedback. Thanks a lot. Dankjewel daar ben ik blij mee. Thanks for your wonderful review. Hope to see you once. I am so sorry. Hope you had medicine for her attac. Thanks for your lovely review. Thanks for your lovely review. I was happy aswell hosting you. Thanks again for the limoncello. I take a small sip the first night aswell as yesterday. I love it. I did not inform you that I have a problem with the other room. The plummer had to come but is not able to come before the 1ste of September. Fortunately, nothing serious was going on. Water had flowed from the shower into the hallway. I would have liked it if you had told me that. Now I had to get someone in while it would not have been necessary. Dank je wel Ton, voor je aardige recensie. Ik ben er blij mee.  Thanks for your lovely review, hope to see you to. Best regards, Petra Thanks Dante for sending me the public transport card. Much obliged. Petra Thanks a lot for your great review. Hope to see you again.<br/><br/>Petra The broken wine glass is not a problem at all. Thanks for your review and hope to see you to.<br/><br/>Petra"
39696069,"Dear Francisco and Blanca,<br/>We are very disappointed to read your review here. You have stayed with us for 3 nights but you never approached us for any of the complaints you listed in this review. We have very high standards of cleaning as you can read from many other reviews. If you could have informed us of the hair or stains, we could have come back immediately. What you are mentioning about the lighting at the entrance or the window is totally false. They work perfectly fine if you could have asked me to show you. Dear Aliona, it states clearly in the listing that kitchen is not included. We do our best to accommodate our guests while following regulations of the municipality. Kindly please better assess before booking. Thank you, Jesse"

The next part is not for you but for Eunjee:<br/>Eunjee booked a stay in August and clearly did not appreciate our offering unfortunately. <br/>We always strive to improve so feedback is taken very seriously. Having said that, in this case I have to point out that in the same month, with the same cleaning procedure and host, we received three five star reviews out of four bookings. One of those reviews explicitly included ‚ÄúSpotless furniture & linens‚Äù, ‚ÄúPristine kitchen‚Äù and ‚ÄúSqueaky-clean bathroom‚Äù.<br/>Before leaving our personal home to go on holiday this August, we spent three days machine scrubbing and re-oiling the wooden floor, and we bought new linens for guests to enjoy. I can honestly say I have never left the apartment as clean as it was this time around.<br/>For me, part of the reason for AirBnB-ing the apartment is to share the wonderful space and give people the opportunity to enjoy it too. I guess this time that didn‚Äôt work out. I hope Eunjee and her husband nevertheless enjoyed their stay in Amsterdam.<br/>Readers of Eunjee's review can make up their own minds, and hopefully those that prefer a stay with a personal element and interaction will self select! I look forward to meeting many of you in the years to come. Thank you Dennis for being a great guest! Thanks Fares, it was a pleasure! Thanks for you kind review Srinivas! It was a pleasure hosting you. Glad you enjoyed your stay Gill! Thanks Maya, hope you'll consider us again on your next stay! Thanks so much for your kind review Lucy!

Glad to hear you enjoyed your stay in Amsterdam and feel free to contact me when you are in the area next time (I would take care of the neighbours in advance for you lol)!"
42123074,"Thank you Erika for your review. The second bed that is mentioned is 90 cm X 200 cm. This is a normal size single bed. Maybe you missed this one, its hidden behind the wood panel with the child's bed underneath it. We have two child's beds we didnt include. Vielen Dank f√ºr diese s√º√üe Bewertung Hannelore. Leider ist Amsterdam ziemlich teuer mit Parkpl√§tzen. Das ist √ºberall in der Innenstadt. Damit versucht Amsterdam, Autos in der Stadt zu reduzieren. G√ºnstigere Parkh√§user gibt es nicht. Die beste Option ist das P + R, das ich Ihnen per E-Mail geschickt habe. es ist zeitaufw√§ndig, aber billig. Thanks so much for your kind messages! Sorry we didnt meet in person. Good to hear everything was just fine for you guys. You are welcome back any time :)  Yess we would love that! thanks a lot :) Hi Chris, Im so sorry Im too late with getting back to you. You didnt get a review from me on your page but I want to thank you for arranging the stay. Your friends were very polite and tidy! Hope to see you guys back one day. gr Peter  Kamil and Zaleha were very neat and kind people. Good communication. Pefect guests! Emilie, thanks for staying! Its a shame we didnt meet in person I hope you enjoyed Amsterdam though and it wasn't too far for you to get around. I would say the best way in Amsterdam to get around the city is by bike.  If you consider Leidseplein as the heart of the centre Its about 10 min biking. <br/>"

42698391,"Thank you for your reaction. I understand, and we don't want guests to be cold, you do not want to be cold. We explained and have taken action directly. You said you wanted to wake up with warm house, and we arranged for heating to go on at 600 as per you request, if you had had any other request we would have done what you please. Hence being called a liar does not go down very well, as you might appreciate. Sorry that it has been a disappointing experience for you. Sorry you experienced like this. Despite several times informing that check out is 10.00 am, and after knock on the door to make sure you know I am there, guest were still in bed and suitcases not packed, which seems rather disappointing and disrespectful to me. thank you Harald, and also for being a great and tidy guest.

43191575,"please come again next year! welcome! I understand that a lock-box might seem more logical. It (the apartment and many other buildings in the city) is, however, not so easy to apply this to private property within the municipality of Amsterdam. Fellow house-owners are part of a homeowner association that does not easily allow modification to be made to the exterior of monumental buildings. thanks, very happy to have you, please come back again! and hope you will find your way in Amsterdam and will feel at home! be in contact!"
43932029,"Thank you so much for your wonderful review and again for your staying.

44419971,"‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Dank Anthony voor de mooie recensie. In onze info schrijven we al dat het appartement n laag plafond heeft. Dat werkt door in de leefbaarheid van de ruimte. De fotos laten het ook zien. Koken mag niet van de inspectie vanwege het lage plafond en daardoor geen keukenafvoer. Douchen kan heel goed op de stoel die we in het bad geplaatst hebben. Je kan ook een bad nemen en we hebben 2 wastafels. Veel mogelijkheden dus. Alles terug te zien in de uitgebreide info. Dank je wel Fiona. Was erg leuk dat jullie hier waren. Dank je wel. Ik vond het met jullie ook heel erg leuk.!! Wat een lieve review. Hoop jullie ooit terug te zien. Ben ook zo blij met de ijsbeer van Eve. Dank jullie wel dat jullie hier zijn geweest en zo fijn dat jullie het naar je zin hebben gehad. Groet, kiek ü•∞üëçüëãüëã Alle voorzieningen staan in de info. Inderdaad geen magnetron.<br/>Er waren per persoon 2 handdoeken voor 3 nachten.<br/>In de badkamerkast staat veel toiletpapier om te pakken als de eerste 2 rollen op zijn. Thank you so much Stephanie and David. I love the idea to see you back sometime. Your were great guests. Jullie waren ook echt hele lieve gasten !!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è ü•∞üëã Thanks a lot for everything Iain and Rebecca. Will think of you once we are in Bristol.üëãüëã Thanks for the 4 star review, but having said that you start a public complain which we did not expect.<br/>This is really a private room. Large with own bathroom. Own frontdoor, own key.<br/>They idea of a BNB is basicly: meeting new people all over the world. In Holland the house owner has to live in the same house as the guests. They give info and give a good personal service.<br/>If you look well at the info you can see that we do not have a parkingplace. You did not even tell us you came by car. You sent us your arrival time of the train at central station. So I sent you a map how to reach us from there. Parking prices you can google and we can tell you all about, but you travelled by train you said. Also in the info, no washing machines.  A few hours  after  the check in you sent us a message if you could bring a brother you met by surprise. Of course we said yes,But all the time you were not at home, but out till late in the evening. In the meanwhile we made a bed for the extra person. I think we did all we could do to please you during this 1 day ( 2 nights) you spent in our basement. Thanks Gonzalo, great to have you here. Hope to see you again somewhere in the future. Yes, both of you and Kingsday were great.<br/>About the shower, indeed anexperience to shower standing up. Insted of that, we have a stool special made to sit during showering and also a bathtub to lay down and relax. So many choices. Hope to see you both back one day. Kiek is the woman, Eiso the man Dear Jeannine, what a pity you gave us 1 star less because of the shower The apartment is so big, the bathroom is so big and we didn't ask you to kneel or sit. You could simply have been lying in the bath. Many guests think it is worth an extra star.<br/>Kiek Thank you both for this great review. !!!!  Have a nice x mas and a very good new year 2020. Hi Thomas, Thanks for your positiv review. Cleaning the dishes is mostly done by myself. As the guests leave the house we do the refills, making the bed<br/> ( if necessary ) and do the dishes. You are really the first ones doing it so fast and by yourself before we could do it. Thank you for that. Hot water indeed, but can be mixed with the cold water tab in the same time. Napkins, very good idea. Will do that NOW ! Thanks again for being here ! Kiek Thank you so much for being here.<br/>You left everything in great shape.<br/>Hope you have a good journey ! Greetings kiek and Eiso What a pity that you had to tell Air bnb that we came late. This just happened indeed, but not on purpose and indeed we were very apologetic. We do not like this either ourselves. Hope you will be able to get over this after all the ""good "" things we did for you. Like letting you use the washing machines without charging you extra ( as we say in our rules), and giving you a ride to your hotel. Auf wieder sehen ! Dear Gabriela, great to hear you had a good time in Amsterdam. We were a little disappointed to hear that you disagreed with the info we give at the instruction site.<br/>We inform people about the height of the ceiling and also about the sizes of the apartment, see under. So no surprises. We indeed have tall people not coming for that reason, But that is why we give this honest info.<br/><br/>Huishandleiding<br/>Top location in the centre. Basement in original canal house , built 16 th century. Low ceiling ( advice MAX LENGHT persons 1.85 m ) <br/><br/>Space<br/>The room is large and atmospheric (approx. 60 m2). In addition to a double bed there is also a sofa bed, which allows the room to sleep with one person (child). There is a fridge in the room, some kitchenware and necessities for making coffee and tea. There is also a spacious private bathroom (13 m2) with bath. Do not smoke.<br/> In the detaillist we warn people about the very original low ceiling. It is a more then 400 years old huge basement. It is a choice people can make themselve. Wether you take it or not. Our guests never ever have complaint about an unpleasant experience. I think when you are delayed from 9 am and arrive at 10 am and check in at 3pm, it is understandable that i ws a bit rude at arrival, especially with all modern communications, or even public phones. I never had any guests taking 5 hours to reach our apartment. Quiet unusual to me, sorry to say so.As it is not a hotel with a hoste to wait any hour for guests. Just a charming private location.Hope people in general normally understand. Let this be a racing accident, why not? Hi Arif, height never has been a problem, because we tell people it is a low ceiling basement. And about the location, it is not Near the center, it IS the center !  Good to have you around. Hi Greg, Thank you for being here. We boost the wifi signal after your departure. :-) Thank you Laura for your comments. Under BASICS at the airbnb site we let people know about the height of our low ceiling appartement. Advice: max lenght 1.85 m. So people are warned and we never have guests taller than 1.80m. Hi Julian. Thank you for the nice recensie. You are right about the low ceiling, but we tell the quests in our prescription. see tekst below. Hope to see you back once in the future.<br/>The room ( 60m2 ) is a classic basement (built in 1640 ) , this means that the headroom is limited ( 1.85 m). This has never been a problem for us for the user . The space is furnished with cozy booths and a long table , so you will have little trouble here . However, it is something that you should know "
44725462,"Really sad to read this, since I didn‚Äôt get any response to my text messages I figured out you didn‚Äôt want any communication that‚Äôs why I gave you the privacy and left you alone‚Ä¶ Thanks, sorry to read it was cold. Next time please text me and I will turn the heating higher Thanks for your review, wished you would‚Äôve text me about the windows because the small round window opens, I think you might have missed that one Indeed you need to walk through the hallway (2 steps) for the bathroom, but it is a private bathroom.

I want to apologize for not having left you a review when I could. I just returned home now and even though any trace of your stay would have been wiped out by now if there had been any, I can tell you took a very good care of my boat. And then, knowing you and your family also enjoyed the outside deck fully, makes me very happy to have shared my place with you. Thank you for all.

My dear Hope, thank you so much for your wonderful review :)<br/>It was such a great honor to host you.<br/>Smal correction:<br/>At the front side of my apartment, there is a pull out bed,<br/>So you can make a single bed from it, and even a very comfortable master bed for 2 Persons.<br/>So all together I can host 4 persons in total.<br/>Take good care of yourself dear, and I will be over the moon to see you soon again!<br/>üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è<br/>Louise It became  a very embarrassing stay with this family!<br/>They decided to stay in my upper floor, because they had a very Ill handicapt daughter.<br/>It‚Äôs Not true that they had no choice !<br/>The Airbnb apartment was clean and ready to enter for this family, but this family decided to stay in my beautiful house upstairs, because there was more space and even a breathtaking view at the river and the illuminated skinny bridge.<br/>Besides that, there was even a stove in my house, so the mother was able to prepare a meal  for her other daughter who was allergic for certain foods. Hi Alejandro,<br/>In my advertisement you could see, that there is no stove in the apartment.<br/>These are the rules of the municipality of Amsterdam!<br/>We are not allowed to offer  tourists a whole house, this to avoid that there are no houses for  locals who are looking for a place to live.<br/>As you could see, there is a KOFFIE machine, a weather boiler, a toaster, and a fridge!<br/>You could have ask me to use my kitchen on the 1st floor in my apartment!<br/>That should be ok!!<br/>I told you about this possibly when you came Upstairs to use my washing machine!! Dear Larissa,<br/>To clarify, there is a floor heating in the apartment!<br/>So the floor is super comfortable and warm, even for little children !<br/>You could have ask me to higher the floor heating!,<br/>My apartment is also super comfortabel for families with children, or baby‚Äôs<br/>Very often there are family‚Äôs staying in the apartment with baby‚Äôs, and little children, and they always felt Super safe and comfortable !!<br/>They were even always very happy with the very comfortable baby cot which I also offered you!!!<br/>Nobody never  complained about cables connected with the lamps!??!<br/>It‚Äôs a pity, that you did not show your gratitude because I even offered you my kitchen to prepare the food for your baby!<br/>Take care, and lots of luck with your baby girl. Dear Theresa,<br/>To clarify this misunderstanding, about the use of the garden!<br/>I told you, that you could use  the whole garden!!!!<br/>So you could sit there any time, but not during the night of course!<br/>Because we are living in a residential area,...the people are sleeping in the night, so....then we have to be quiet this out of respect for the privacy of the neighbors. Dear Jon,<br/>The marble floor has a floor heating.<br/>So if you are here next time, I will turn on the floor heating too.<br/>Such a great pleasure to have you here, and I am looking forward to meet you soon again:) Michelle<br/>To clarify,...there is enough space to host 4 persons in my apartment located on the GROUND FLOOR<br/>From the pullout bed you can make a very comfortabel 2 persons bed.<br/>As you can read in all the reviews of all my guests, over 1000  guests were staying here, that they are always very comfortabel in my apartment.<br/>I advise you to stay in hotels in the future,because Of your very self centered character.<br/>I offered you a very early check in, because you arrived early in the morning.<br/>This to avoid that you had to walk around with your luggage until the official check in time 15:00<br/>You were super happy with this offer.<br/>And we had an agreement!!!<br/>You overslept, missed the train, and arrived finally at 14:30.<br/>Without keeping me posted you kept me waiting, and because of that i missed the appointment with my dentist.<br/>You showed me a very rude, unreliable behavior!!<br/>Please don‚Äôt come back anymore, Hello Joshua,<br/>I am so sorry for you,that your legs are so extremely long.<br/>So so sorry that they touched the wall  while seated on the toilet.<br/>There were here over 1000 guests staying, and nobody had a problem with that, and enjoyed my very comfortable bathroom very much!!<br/>Besides that it‚Äôs quiet shocking and disrespectful, to read that you wanted to stay in my private house!!<br/>I am living in that part of my house, and I don‚Äôt rent that part out of course!!!<br/>But I know some people are never satisfied! <br/>It should have even been more nice of you, if you mentioned,that you even could use my washing machine and the dryer without paying any penny!! Dear Jennifer.<br/>I am so happy to hear that you were having such a wonderful stay!<br/>I want to let you know, that the upstairs door is always locked.<br/>So there is lots of privacy in the apartment.<br/>But for the reason that you stayed 6 nights in my apartment I had to come down after I asked you if it was ok, to clean the towels, and to bring you all kinds of Christmas treats, to spoil you and to surprise you.:)) kaitlyn and her Friend Leo, were really very problematic persons.<br/>They should check in at 12:30, but suddenly they appeared 5 hours later.<br/>So they kept me waiting for 5 hours.<br/>They were drunk and high,were drinking whisky and beer, and they wanted to smoke or taking drugs in my apartment, and in the garden, while they knew, that it was not allowed.<br/>They did not respect my beautiful  property at all!<br/>Probably they got a fight,because all my clean bedlinen was on the ground. <br/>They left all of a sudden, without sleeping here, and there was vomit all over the place.<br/>It took my cleaner hours to clean the whole apartment.<br/>This was a terrible experience with these persons,and I am very sorry but it‚Äôs impossible to recommend them! Hi Leslie,<br/>I am so sorry but it‚Äôs very very quiet here.<br/>Have a look at the review of all my other super enthusiastic grateful guests!!!<br/>THIS LOCATION IS A HEAVEN OF PIECE AND<br/>I am so sorry that you were drunk all the time. Caitlin,to clarify  my upstairs apartment, is mine!!<br/>SO ITS MY PRIVATE,!!<br/>I NEVER RENT OUT THIS PART OF MY HOUSE OF COURSE, BECAUSE I LIVE THERE!!!<br/>So sorry for this misunderstanding!<br/>Have a look at all the reviews my guests left!<br/>It‚Äôs always very very quiet here!!<br/>Everybody is always sleeping here like roses. Omg<br/>SHIRLEY TUCSON, WAS really the most ungrateful exhausted and ill guest I ever hosted.<br/>First of all Shirley Tucson, the wife of James Tucson, was a psychiatric patient and she was really irresponsible to take care of her VERY OLD husband.<br/>She was over over and over tired And mentally very ill.<br/>They made a river cruise before they entered my apartment.<br/>About this river cruise she was also complaining complaining and again complaining.<br/>The staff of this ship was terrible, <br/>The food was not good enough, they got ill,the had to pay lots of money to see a doctor, it was dirty and loud on board, there were people blowing etc etc etc.<br/>The check in time of my Airbnb is 15:00, and the check out time is 12:00<br/>We do need this time to clean the apartment.<br/> But Shirley Tucson was standing In front of my door at 10:00 with lots of suitcases, ringing loud the doorbell,because she wanted to enter my apartment immediately, while the previous guest were taking a shower.!!!<br/>SIRLEY TUCSON AND HER HUSBAND had breakfast in a lunchroom around the corner of my house, before they came to my apartment, but the owner of this lunch room, kicked them out, because she was VERY loud, very cheeky and shouting!!!!<br/>This was very embarrassing!!!<br/>So at 10:00 she was loud ringing the door bel of my apartment, because she wanted to check inn immediately!!<br/>My neighbors came outside to have a look what was going on!!<br/>She knew that the check in time was 15:00 but she ignored completely my rules.<br/>So I asked her politely to wait, because there were still guests inside. <br/>Then she started to shout at me!!!<br/>So as soon as the previous guests left, I let them inside.<br/>I told them that they could leave their luggage in the apartment, <br/>and I wanted to give them the key of the front door, so they were able to explore the city.<br/>But they were so exhausted, so they wanted to check in immediately!!!!!<br/>This was impossible of course, because the cleaner wanted to clean the apartment.<br/>Then they started to complain about my kitchen!<br/>There was no breakfast.<br/>OMG<br/>OF COURSE THERE WAS NO BREAKFAST, BECAUSE THE PREVIOUS GUEST JUST LEFT,SO WE NEEDED TO CLEAN THE APARTMENT,AND TO PUT FRESH BREAKFAST ITEMS!!<br/>SHIRLEY TUCSON, is really mentally very ill,and she behaves very irresponsible.<br/>This area, is the most quiet and clean area of the city.<br/>Also confirmed by al my previous guest.<br/>( it‚Äôs all in their wonderful reviews they left)<br/>SO ALL THE COMPLAINTS OF SHIRLEY TUCSON, ABOUT NOISY AND BLOWING PEOPLE AROUND MY HOUSE ARE BIG BIG LIES,!!<br/>I AM SURE THAT SHE TOOK DRUGS, BECAUSE SHE WAS COMPLETELY UNACCOUNTABLE<br/>IT WAS EVEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO UNLOCK MY FRONT DOOR WITH THE KEY,!!,<br/>AND FINALLY.......<br/>SHE ASKED ME TO ORDER A TAXI THE NEXT DAY, TO BRING HER TO THE AIRPORT AT 11:00 AM<br/>SO AT 11:00 AM THE TAXI DRIVER WAS STANDING IN FRONT OF MY DOOR, TO BRING THEM TO THE AIRPORT, BUT..........SHIRLEY TUCSON AND HER HUSBAND JAMES TUCSON, LEFT ALREADY!!!<br/>SO THE TAXI DRIVER BECAME VERY ANGRY OF COURSE, BECAUSE SHE DID NOT CANSEL HER RESERVATION.<br/>I have never met such an irresponsible completely unaccountable guest, and do really I hope this will never happen again!!!<br/>because this was a terrible experience with SHIRLEY TUCSON. Darryl I am so sorry, that you were unable to respect my place<br/>You did not respect the house rules at all<br/>I never hosted such a disrespect person like you.<br/>It  was very sure that you came to Amsterdam to get drunk,so for the alcohol and drugs.<br/>When you entered my house, you were already drunk.<br/>You made a big mess in my house.<br/>There was alcohol all over the place.<br/>Even drugs.<br/>Very rude you opened all the doors of my private cabinets, and smashed your clothes all over the place.<br/>The toilet and my towels, were very dirty, <br/>And even the toilet was full of dirty paper, you were to drunk to clean yourself.<br/>I am very sorry, but you are not welcome anymore in my house. Hello Fry,<br/>There is a huge misunderstanding in your review.<br/>Because in the apartment I am renting out trough Airbnb , there are no stairs!!!<br/>There is a thermostat, and you can put the temperature up as high as you want to make it as warm as possible.<br/>THERE ARE RADIATORS ALL OVER THE PLACE.<br/>SO SUPER WARM AND COMFORTABLE.<br/>There is no cat in the apartment.<br/>It's impossible for the cat  to enter the ground floor, because there is a door leading to the ground floor.<br/>The cat is in my own private place.<br/>THERE ARE NO STAIRS IN  THE APARTMENT I AM RENTING OUT TROUGH AIRBNB .<br/>YOU MADE A MISTAKE BY EXPLAINING HOW MY PRIVATE PLACE LOOKS LIKE IN YOUR   REVIEW.<br/>SO ITS QUIET CONFUSING. Dear Natalya,<br/>You misunderstood the way we make a bed here in the Netherlands.<br/>We DON'T PUT a blanket in the duvet!!!...you didn't understood this :-))<br/>UNDER THE DUVET WE PUT AN EXTRA BLANKET.<br/>SO YOU ARE SLEEPING UNDER A BLANKET,AND THEN  THE DUVET. Hi Uri,<br/>When I entered the apartment I saw that you left a big mess.<br/>You did not leave the apartment tidy, while you promised me to do that.<br/>So you left my place in a very disrespect way.<br/>You even did not close the door to the garden, so the cat was inside. Dear Hannah,<br/>I kept  the pictures of the cooker in my advertisement, to let my guests know, that there is a possibility to use my wonderful huge kitchen.<br/>I am very sorry for you, that you were the only guest who stayed here,who complained  about trailing cables for lights????<br/>There are no trailing cables!!<br/>Over 1000 guests, also lots of family's with little children stayed here, and they found my apartment ideal for little children.<br/>Lots of space, very comfortable, even with an access to the beautiful back yard. Catharina,<br/>You made a reservation for 3 persons.<br/>When you checked in very late, I asked you if I had to make a 1 single  bed of the pullout bed.<br/>Because 2 persons were sleeping in the bedroom on the very huge comfortable master bed, and the 3th person should sleep on the very comfortable sofa couch for only ‚Ç¨40 a night.<br/>Everybody is sleeping there always like roses, and everybody is  always sleeping and feeling very comfortable on the pull out bed.<br/>Catharina, When there is a request for 4 persons, then I make a very comfortable 2 persons bed from the pull out bed of course, with an extra special top mattress to make it very comfortable to sleep there with 2 persons.<br/>But Your friend slept alone on the sofa couch, so just 1 person, and he told me that it was not necessary of course to make a bed for 2 persons from  the sofa couch, because he slept there alone, and he payed for a single bed.!!!<br/>So I made a very comfortable single bed for him, like I always do, and as you can read in all the reviews everybody is always very grateful and are feeling always privileged by staying in my very comfortable apartment, and everybody is always sleeping there like roses.<br/>Late in the evening your friend Martin, changed all of a sudden his mind, and demanded  me to make a 2 persons bed JUST FOR HIM ALONE.????<br/>So instead of being very grateful for the very comfortable single bed I made for him, he demanded a 2 persons bed just for him self????<br/>I am very sorry for that, and actually I don't understand this!<br/>He payed for a single room,and wanted to take advantage of me by demanding a double 2 persons bedroom.??.<br/>I am very sorry Catharina, but that's not the way to behave. Judy I am so sorry that you were disappointed about my beautiful historical canal house, from the 17th century, so ideal located along the river the Amstel!<br/>As you can read in all the 263 reviews of all my guests who's stayed here, everybody was always very very enthusiastic about this beautiful spotless characteristic Canal House.<br/>As soon as you entered you complained immediately about this wonderful house.<br/>You told me that you preferred modern soulless houses.<br/>Dear Judy, i don't understand why you booked this canal house, because you could see in all the pictures of my advertisement, that it is an historical protected characteristic canal house from the 17th century!<br/>I advice you if you ever want to make a reservation in an other Airbnb, be sure that you book a modern house.<br/>I do understand that you are not able to estimate the valuation, of this historical canal house.<br/>Compared with other houses of the 17e century in Amsterdam,located in this amazing area, I am extremely low in the price.<br/>I keep the price of the rent for all my guests low, to make it possible for everybody who is interested to stay in such a beautiful canal house in such an amazing area!<br/>You can read in my reviews that my house is very clean, and spotless.<br/> Dear Andrew,<br/>I'm so sorry that you weren't satisfied with my apartment. To clarify your first misunderstanding; the add clearly says that the apartment is situated in the souterrain of my canal house. Secondly, I'm so sorry for you that you were the only guest, of all the hundreds that stayed here, to complain about spiderwebs and a mouldy smell. As you can read in the reviews, all my other guests were very enthusiastic about my apartment. They reward me with enough stars to be able to become a super host. According to them my apartment is always very tidy and clean. Also, I'm so sorry for you that even my pillows weren't good enough for you. If you had a better look, you'd find the extra pillows lying in the cupboard, where I put them for your comfort. As well as a small, thick, blue towel in the bathroom, which you could have used as a bathmat. But I guess if you find the distance from the bedroom to the bathroom (8 meters) too long, you must have been very very tired indeed. I did my utmost to make your stay at the Amstel as comfortable as possible. Even the fridge was filled with groceries for you to take as breakfast; for free. If this all doesn't please you, then I don't know what will.<br/>Kind regards,<br/>Louise Dear Melissa, I am sorry you feel this way. May I remind you that we made an appointment at 10 pm to check the house together to see if everything was ok before you left. Since you closed the curtains and ignored me when I politely knocked, I thought that maybe something was wrong. Also, I clearly instructed you not to throw anything other than toilet paper in the toilet. Yet the plumber found Turkish antisceptic tissues in the toilet that weren't there before you arrived, so forgive me for drawing the conclusion that these tissues were yours. About the garden, I only covered the lounge area because of the bad weather. Otherwise the furniture would have gone wet. After you left, I discovered that you smoked inside the apartment, which you knew was not allowed. For you to criticize me, to me, is not justified. "
47042751,"Victor, you make me speechless with this review. Thank you so much for this and being an absolute very extraordinary guest! There a not enough words available to describe how this has been experienced. Nothing but positive thoughts and all the best for you and your wife! Also many thanks from Kiddy! Stay save. Hi Lia, taking in account all the communication we had during your stay, your lovely words about my apartment and cat, i find it hard to read this review and also out of place. You could have said this to me or even asked up front when i helped you with all kinds of details regarding your stay. Its unfortunately now but never mind, i wish you all the best in future airbnb deals."
47179858,"Thanks so much Kelly. We loved having you as our guests. Do come again some day. Hi Jill, I'm sorry it wasn't a perfect experience for you. We talked about the towels that were still in the dryer and the clean dishes in the dishwasher and you offered to take them out once the machines were done. I didn't expect you to give us 3 star review for that. Otherwise I would have come back to do it myself. We had back to back bookings and weren't able to manage in time. We never do not make up a bed. And always clean out the drain. So that sounds really strange to hear to say the least.  I was in constant app contact with you about your arrival and you said you waited 3 minutes in total. If I remember your own words when we greated you in front of the apartment apologizing for running a bit late. Anyway, I hope you have seen our other reviews which are mostly 5 stars. I guess we can afford a little criticism once in a while even if I don't believe all of it is justified. But all is good. Take care. Barbara This is the review we wrote you, which we think speaks for itself. <br/>""Although it was nice to welcome Yaeli and her young family, they often did not communicate with us when required. They didn't follow up on house rules: the bedroom smelled of smoke, while this is a non smoking apt. They were allowed to smoke on the balcony with doors closed, but haven't followed up on the doors closed request, as we had to do a lot to get rid of the smoke smell. We also were okay with welcoming their baby, although we normally don't welcome children and have no equipment for the little ones. They rented equipment, but never contacted the company about the pick-up. Leaving us to take care of it. It took days to take care of. They never answered app messages about this matter. They left in a hurry at check-out, which meant we had quite some extra work getting the apartment ready for the next guest. We allowed for an early check-in, only to find they were already at the apt entrance for quite some time, blocking the entrance for the neighbors. Not a good experience."" Obrigado Marisa pelo seu coment√°rio. N√≥s os consideramos convidados muito agrad√°veis. Certamente levaremos seu coment√°rio particular conosco para o futuro. Tenha um bom retorno ao lar. Ciao! We enjoyed hosting you Adam. Take care! Warm regards! Hi James, <br/>thank you for your review. I would like to comment on a few things you mention here. <br/>-We communicated a phone number with you to use on the day of your arrival, which you did not use. Although the airport has free wifi and you could have communicated with us free of charge.<br/>-You booked under someone else's name, Mitch, but turned out to be James. And were not open about that. Maybe you can open your own account. This Airbnb community is based on trust and openness.<br/>-You had one entire separate part of the closet for your clothes, which is more than enough space for a stay of a few days. <br/>-There is a lot of light in the apartment, just not overhead lights everywhere. Which makes it cosy. And there is enough light if you need it for reading etc.<br/>-The belongings in the bathroom are in one drawer. Out of sight. You had the other drawer and all the shelves at your disposal. We are not sure what the problem is.<br/>-Isn't the whole idea of Airbnb that you are staying in someone else's home?<br/>At check in and check out you seemed very content. We therefore don't really understand your review."
47264521,"Thx, so nice that you enjoyed your stay and the house. Thx Steve and always welcome to return! Sorry for the inconvenience caused by working done on next door appartment. We did not know it would be during your stay. We will check for the future.  Never experienced a problem with wifi before, sorry, works ok when checked later."

47819385,Thanks for your kind review! Thanks Semir! I am happy to hear you guys had a great time. We'll be glad to host you again this summer!
48549839,"Haha ik ben ook heel erg blij dat Anna je over heeft gehaald en dat de ervaring goed is bevallen. Alles wat jullie omschrijven is wat ik hoop dat gasten hier meemaken, leven met en op het water met alles wat daarbij hoort, zwanen die aankloppen, zwemmen in de gracht, varen, de stad in gaan als je daar zin in hebt en relaxen rondom de boot als je de drukte zat bent, jullie hebben het helemaal goed begrepen! :) Beste Alessia,<br/>Wat vervelend dat het verblijf niet aan jullie verwachtingen heeft voldaan en geen positieve recensie hebben kunnen achterlaten. Ik had jullie graag geholpen om dit beter te maken maar dit kwam echt als een verassing voor mij.<br/>Het is voor mij als host ook zeker niet gebruikelijk om een minder goede ervaring met gasten te delen maar  jullie moeten echt weten dat bijna twee uur later arriveren dan aangegeven, te laat uitchecken, savonds laat op ramen en deuren bonken omdat jullie de sleutel vergeten zijn en meer onhandigheden die ik niet gewend ben van gasten en dan niet tevreden zijn mij erg raken en mijn reputatie als host schaden. Ik wens jullie alle geluk maar ook meer wijsheid en bedachtzaamheid in jullie eigen rol als gast op toekomstige reizen <br/>Groet<br/>Helen Wat ontzettend leuk om te horen, jullie waren hele fijne gasten en ik wens jullie nog heel veel plezier in Lissabon! üåàüôè‚öìÔ∏è Nou wat een geweldig compliment en ik ben erg blij te kunnen hebben bijdragen aan jullie mooie reis!<br/>Dank jullie wel en liefs<br/>Helen Dankjewel Kathleen het was leuk om te zien dat jullie je zo goed vermaakt hebben hier in Amsterdam en op de boot Dankjewel Hannah het genoegen was geheel wederzijds en hopelijk tot ziens! üôèüå∑‚öìÔ∏è Hoi Sarah, dank je wel voor je bericht en het klopt dat de katten toegang hebben tot de hal, deze hal is officieel gedeelde ruimte maar ik gun deze vaak aan de gasten. Ik overweeg wel deze ruimte ook niet toegankelijk te maken voor de katten dus jouw feedback is helpend<br/>Sigaretten rook is wel echt vreemd want roken op de boot is niet toegestaan en heb ik ook nog niet eerder gehoord. Hallo Carla, fijn om te horen dat jullie een leuke tijd hebben gehad. En excuses als er zaken niet duidelijk waren. Het terras was zeker bereikbaar en ook beschikbaar voor jullie en de schommel was aanwezig in de kamer maar hadden wij niet opgehangen vanwege het slechte weer maar had ik met plezier voor jullie willen doen als jullie dat mij hadden laten weten.<br/>En ik woon inderdaad ook op de boot maar heb mijn eigen priv√© gedeelte en ingang. De hal en hoofd entree is eigenlijk gemeenschappelijk maar gun de meeste gasten deze ook als een priv√© ruimte te gebruiken zodat je een geheel eigen unit tot je beschikking hebt en dus eigenlijk meer dan wat de advertentie ‚Äúpriv√© kamer op woonboot‚Äù aanbiedt.<br/>Een en ander staat ook omschreven in de aanbieding op Airbnb maar nogmaals excuses als dat voor jullie niet duidelijk was, maar hopelijk met deze uitleg wel wat meer<br/>Hartelijke groet <br/>Helen Thank you for your kind words and it was my pleasure to have you as guests feel free to come back anytime! üôè"
48790899,"Hi Eve,<br/>You could have asked me for an extra ventilator. But with this heatwave also temperature in the night were extremely warm. We provided also extra towels to swim with the locals in the harbor and cool down like we do ourselves. You have to try that next time. <br/>Ahoy,<br/>Egbert It has been a pleasure hosting you. You are welcome back any time! Hi,<br/>If you come back in summer you are welcome to swim next to our boat and experience also the waterlife in Amsterdam east. That will make your stay even better. Hi Luke,<br/>The breakfast was made by my 11 year old daughter. This is optional and not always available because she has to have time to prepare besides her normal day program. I am happy you liked it. Also my daughter enjoyed preparing it for you. Hi Alexander. Too bad you think our location is a bit lonely. We like to be just out of the action of the city centre and still close to nice restaurants, museums and bars. Please come back in summer when you can enjoy the life on the street with all water activity around our ship. You will experience a more lively neighbourhood for shure. For us a quiet place to sleep is pure luxury in this town. ;-) Hi April,<br/>I'm happy to hear you had a good stay at our studio and Amsterdam.<br/>The bar is you went is called: 'JOOST' and not Jooster. The collection beers is great over there.<br/>Hope to see you again.<br/>Egbert Beste Sonja, <br/>Wat jammer dat je het ontbijt miste. Op de site van airbnb hadden we aangegeven dat onze service zonder ontbijt is. Geef volgende keer aan als je iets mist. Misschien dat we he kunnen helpen. <br/>Ahoy,<br/>Egbert"
48791845,"Thanks Mats, likewise! Welcome back anytime with your friends! Thank you very much Lucas! I appreciate your feedback :) It was a pleasure to have and your family around! Thank you Javier! Your feedback means a lot to us :) Thank you so much for kindness Kiersten. It was lovely to have you and your friends around! Thank you Roberto! I appreciate your kind words very much. All the best to you and your lovely family! Thank you Henry. It was a pleasure to have you and your friends around! Emrah I am very sorry to hear that your stay didn‚Äôt meet your expectations.  However, I must clarify several key points for accuracy. Our listing clearly outlines the property details, including the presence of cats and the style of accommodation- a room in rental unit with attached bathroom, to ensure full transparency regarding the property.  It appears that you  overlooked this important information prior to making the booking. The property was clean and prepared as described, and no issues were noted at the check-in process other than the fact that you were not aware of the kind of rental you booked.  I also want to emphasize that you were offered a partial refund out of goodwill, despite our cancellation policy not requiring one. However, you chose to decline that offer and instead stated your intention to leave a one-star review. This was mediated via customer support and statements made in writing which you choose to omit in your feedback here. I take guest‚Äôs comments and feedback very seriously and always aim to resolve concerns respectfully and fairly. While I respect your right to share your experience, I also stand by the accuracy of our listing and the fairness of the resolution offered. Thank you for your feedback Meric. My listing can be found in category ""rooms"" with ""host on site"" so I think you have missed that when browsing.  It is also listed as a ""smoking- allowed"" property and you smoked inside as well so I am surprised to learn that smoke bothered you. I put a lot of love in the entire process from communication with my guests, to accommodating their late arrival needs like yours, but also into painting and cleaning their space so I am sorry to hear that you haven't noticed it :( Thank you Jose! I appreciate your kindness.  Greetings and enjoy your time left in Amsterdam! Thank you so much!  I really appreciate your feedback üòä It was a pleasure to host you and your friend! Thank you so much Amelie for your kind words. It was a pleasure to host you and your boyfriend. Come back to stay with us anytime please! Thank you for your feedback Salmn. For anyone considering our listing please take into the account the fact that we do live at the property and therefore visitors or loud music in late evening are not allowed. Like mentioned by our guests it is best to take independent housing  to go wild while in Amsterdam. Thank you for kindness Laura! It means a lot to me to know that you and your familly enjoyed your time here with us :) Thank you very much Lucas! I appreciate your feedback and kind words. It was a pleasure to have you and your friends around :) Thank you for your kind words Pamela. I'm pleased to know your family enjoyed their stay with us.  Regarding ""someone"" using the livingroom: you booked a private ensuite room with shared space offered - that being, among others, the livingroom. <br/>Guests who consider booking our listing should get familiar with our  description and pictures. <br/>We do not list ""entire apartment""!<br/>We have not just one but two cats, they became our family members, also both listed here, one visible on the cover picture in our livingroom,  so technically you share with us and two cats. We do not lock up our cats since it's their home however, our guest may choose not to interact with them and lock their doors. The staircase leading from livingroom to 4th floor bedrooms and bathrooms is also shared. That's where you will most likely meet our cats.<br/>We allow one booking at a time therefore there are no strangers under this roof :) Hi Jorge. Thank you for your feedback. I appreciate your kind words. I wish you have told me you needed more shampoo and shower gel during your stay. It could have been easily fixed with one refil. For future guests reading this, we do provide refils on toiletries and that is because The Netherlands does not recycle plastic. We wish not to contribute to more plastic waste  around the world therefore we buy big containers and provide it for our guests. The only recyclable plastic here is the one from soft drinks and water with special logo for which you can receive money back when brought to supermarket. Stairs are steep so either pack light or pay more for a hotel with elevator :) Thank you Yash! It means a lot to me knowing my effort was received well :) it was a pleasure to have you around. All the best! Thank you so much for your kindness! I'm glad you enjoyed your stay with us ü§ó Thank you for your feedback Khalid. I am happy to read that you felt like home. Perhaps it is worth mentioning that the check-in time is between 15-20:00 and in case you book last minute or you wish to aririve earlier (or later) please communicate with me and wait for my  response before you head over to my house since there is no reception. Also, please note that it is a smoker friendly room. It might create discomfort if you are a non smoker. Should there be any issues during your stay please reach out to me. From small things such as an extra tea spoon, to new set of bed linens or parking place availability. Thank you! I appreciate it very much :) Thank you very much for your feedback Ilaria. It was pleasure to have you around. Regarding the price April unfortunatelly is the most busy month of the year due to tulip season and public holidays so if you wish to spend less visit Amsterdam in months of January- March or plan your trip during weekdays- it is usually cheaper. Grazie mille :) Thank you Jose for your kind words! Greetings from Central Hub Amsterdam! Thank you very much Carlos! Sending you and your family warm greetings from Central Hub Amsterdam! I appreciate your kind words Jesus! Greetings from Central Hub Amsterdam! Thanks a milion John! Sending you seasonal greetings from Central Hub Amsterdam! Thank you very much for your kind words Bojana. It was a pleasure to have you and your daughters as guests :) Thank you Andrea! It was a pleasure to have you and your familly around :) Thank you so much for your kind words Gaurav. I wish you have asked about the living space. Our livingroom is available to our guests too. When in doubt it's always good to ask ;) Enjoy Paris! Thank you so much Ingo. I really appreciate your kind words. It was pleasure to have you and your family around. Greetings to all of you and i hope your son adopts a cat üêà Thank you very much Maddie! I'm glad you and friends enjoyed staying with us. Greetings! Thanks John! I appreciate your feedback : ) Thank you so much Clara! It was pleasure to host you! I really appreciate your feedback Christian! Thanks a lot! Thank you so Francisco! It was pleasure to have you as a guest! Grazie mille Domenico! I really appreciate your feedback! It was pleasure to have you and your friends here :) Thank you so much Therese! Your feeback means a lot to me! It was a pleasure to have you around :) Thank you so much Adar! I really appreciate your feedback. Hope to see you again soon! Thank Adam! I really appreciate your kind words. I hope to see you in future. Greetings, <br/>Kate I really appreciate your honest feedback. I'm glad you enjoyed the fact that you could check out at your convenience but as you saw this has a huge impact on how smooth the cleaning process goes. I truly did my best to accommodate you and your friends. I suggest that in your future bookings you mention ahead of time the fact that you travel with a person affected by Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) as this will give the host idea not to allow late checkout and at the same time it will give them a chance to get things ready perfectly for your arrival ( it is 14:00 in my case). I have to admit that guests sitting around and using bathroom facilities make cleaning process less efficient. I'm am really sorry if you experienced discomfort while in the kitchen. I do not allow guests to use it as I am not able to keep up with cleaning it after them. Despite that the previous group was allowed in the kitchen  so I am sorry about the mess you found there. I would also recommend reading the description of the property you are about to book before confirming as it could give you a better idea of where you are about to stay. I am vegan and I communicate it on my description page passionately. I wish you finding the perfect place to stay on your next journey :) Thanks a lot Julia for your kind words. It was a pleasure to host you. I hope to see you back in Amsterdam any time soon! Greetings Thank you so much for your kind words! It was a pleasure to have you around. Greetings!! Thank you. I really appreciate your kind words! Hopefully see you back in Amsterdam :) Thanks Jake! It was great having you here. All the best :) Thank you so much! It was pleasure to have you around :) All the best and hopefully see you back in Amsterdam in no time!  Thanks a lot guys! I'm glad you enjoyed :) Thank you so much! It was great to have you here. If you're ever back in Amsterdam please stay with me :)"

49467463,"goedemorgen Marion! dank voor je prachtige recensie en je opmerking over het bed. In de komende weken komt er een bed voor lange mensen, dus er is aan gedacht ;) anderzijds, echt lange mensen kunnen helaas niet bij ons verblijven omdat de B&B in het souterrain is. In zijn algemeenheid voldoet het huidige bed daarom goed, maar ik begrijp je aanbeveling, dank daarvoor. Thank you Morag, the pleasure was all mine! :) Hi Edson, thank you for your review and tips. I replaced the bed with a more sturdy and comfortable one. Regarding the location: the very very center of Amsterdam starts at less than 400 meters from our home. Our house dates back to 1768. Best regards, Els thank you Justin, it was all my pleasure :) Thank you Stephen, you are very welcome back any time, it was my pleasure!"

51485781,"I am happy you  are very welcome again! Thank you, we love the place too! See you soon Thank  you its  allays a pleasure  to have  you as  guests.   Hope  well meet  again  in  more  sunnier and  warmer  times   to have  bbq  in  the park. Have  great winter! Thank you for the kind words. Hope to see you soon again. Dear  Silvia, I would really suggest  to you when there  is any issue  while you stay at somebody's place to speak clearly to the house owner about the issues you have found  instead  of writing them bad reviews a week later. This way you will get refund or  compensation instead only making for both uncomfortable and bad reviews. We arranged for first time cleaning lady to do the job as we were abroad  as you know and apparently she didn't  took her job seriously. I understand this is our  fault  but still  communication is the way to solve any problems,not  back stabbing. As a matter of fact  your comment is impacting a long line of excellent comments  and reviews  only because you  had no courage  to tell me there  was an issue  while we were abroad and you were staying in the  apartment.You could tellme allof this  when  we  met. We  have  given  you and your kids  all the attention possible,have  broth to them toys  and shared  with you our organic food and coffee and  destroying our  business with bad comments  is totally unfair. If  you wish  a compensation do not  hesitate   but you need to be  honest and  just in your comments. Grazie. Vi aspettiamo a presto !!<br/>"
51582943,"Hi Srikanth, thanks for the feedback and what a pity to hear you are not the most happy person in the world about the stay in my apartment. I will talk with the cleaning lady about the dust I ve never heard this before and I never want to hear it again I am sorry! <br/>Check out times are never a problem for me you can check out whenever you want because I never plan new people on a day when people leave. Your stay was planned for 8 days but 2 days before your check-out you asked me to stay for one night longer... not a problem at all but new people would arrive that day. Please read our Whatsapp conversation again and you will see that I was not curt at all, you didn't response to anything? <br/>Anyway thanks for the feedback I will improve the things you've mentioned..<br/>Bart"
51821132,Five star guest! I would definitely host them again!
52334546,"Hello Amy, thank you so much for your suggestions. I have  bought some new towels for my guests because they were indeed a bit old. <br/>As for the windows: it‚Äôs just 2 windows which can not be completely opened. The rest of the windows in my appartment can be fully opened, including the door to the balcony. <br/>I am glad you enjoyed your stay in my place! Thanks again."
52628502,"Hi Susan, thanks a lot for your review! It's great to hear that you loved the neighborhood and apartment! Sorry to hear that you had problems with the communications, we will use your feedback to improve our service. Thanks again! Thanks a lot for this 5* review, Priyanka! We really appreciatie it! Maybe see you next time :-) Hi Adrian & √Ösa,<br/>thanks for your feedback and review. I am happy you liked the apartment and the location in the middle of the Jordaan. I am sorry to hear about the inconvenience with the WiFi, this is normally working fine, so it is not nice to hear that you had problems with it. About the late check-in, you can see this in ""other things to note"" on the Airbnb-listing. The fee is charged, because it is quiet hard to check-in late and also in respect of the neighbours. I hope you understand. Take care and hopefully we can welcome you again! Thanks Theresa!  Hi Amir, Thanks for your kind feedback. We changed the mattrass last night! Hope to welcome you again some time.  Thanks Brett!  Hi Ana, Thank you for your kind words. We bought a new mattress this weekend!  Thank you for the review Lukas We loved hosting you (: Hi Arthur, thanks for the review. It was great to host you! Hi John, thank you very much for those loving words. We loved hosting you and hope you had an amazing time! (: Thanks for your kind words Philip. I will replace the moquette and clean all of the kitchenware extra next time. Thanks.  Hi Josefin and Johnny, my apologies for these inconvenience. The owner must have added this to the apartment without mentioning this to us, but I changed it directly in the system so this mistake will not happen again. I still hope you had a good stay in the apartment. All the best Hi Laura, thank you very much for the feedback, we will try our best to do something about it. We hope you had a good stay in the apartment.  all the best Hi Jennifer, that is really nice to hear, we really appreciate those kind words. If you go to the website: www.iambnb.nl/welcome and with the password being iambnb , here you can find all (also about the taxi service) information that you need. Hope to see you soon in Amsterdam again!  All the best  Thanks Nicolas!"
53005025,"Please! See the very very very accurate pictures of the room and the rest of the apartment  before you book! 92% of our guests do  so and five star there stay here. No host is able to  accommodate expectations not based in reality. The room you had is the biggest room inda house, twice the size the room you originally rented ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. What a lovely review and what a beautiful drawing/note you left us. So sweet! Hope to meet both of you again sometime somewhere! Factual corrections<br/>-We often host Asian people, (with pleasure!) but we never hosted Taiwanese guests before. The English language issue with Ed caused this error, we suppose. <br/>-The apartment is not located on the first floor but on ground floor. <br/>-The kitchen has a six flames stove, a microwave plus hot air oven, a huge power-fan cooled professional fridge plus a little Nespresso machine. We manage. <br/>-This room is small, point taken, but guests are (most of the time) allowed to chill in the living or on the lounge in the garden. Pretty ok, we think, unless you visit Amsterdam just to spend your time in bed all the time."
53692197,"We are truly baffled by this review, as it simply does NOT reflect reality. Our check-in instructions are crystal clear, and we provide a 24/7 contact number that is always available. <br/>We have double-checked our records, and there were NO missed calls or messages from this guest.<br/>It seems highly likely that this review was left in error, possibly intended for a different accommodation. <br/>We have even reached out to Airbnb regarding its removal, as it is entirely unfounded.<br/>We take pride in our impeccable communication and seamless check-in process, as countless other guests can confirm. <br/>It is unfortunate that such misinformation can be posted publicly and accidentaly, but we hereby encourage future guests to read our many genuine, positive reviews instead, awaiting the removal of this review. Hi Carolin, thank you so much for your comments! I am very glad with your comment about the extra duvet; will organize one! There indeed is washing machine and a dryer; it is on the same floor as the two B&B rooms. I am sorry you didn't realize that (wish you would have asked me...)! Unfortunately the rules in Amsterdam do not allow a kitchen in B&B's (a microwave, fridge, coffee machine, bread toaster  is the maximum I am allowed to offer). And yes: the stairs are quite steep (though not for Amsterdam standards... ;-) ) It was a pleasure having you as my guests! Hi Kathryn,<br/>Thank you for taking the time to write this review. I am very sorry to hear that you experienced your stay this way! I understand the inconvenience it must have caused for waiting at the check in and I will make sure the communication will run smoother with more regular updates. I always try to give a lot of tips and recommendations during the check in and a little extra like the waffles and coffee, but in this case I believe that providing a little book with tips would be a great idea! I was not aware of the cleaning and I immediately checked the mentioned complaints. Again, my sincere apologies for not having a pleasant stay and I take your valuable feedback at heart. Hopefully you did enjoy your overal experience in the wonderful city, you are welcome anytime to notice the difference! Hi Elena,<br/>Thank you for your feedback, highly appreciated! The bathroom is checked again and hopefully you will be able to enjoy the difference when you visit Amsterdam another time.   Thank you Steven! I am happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay. (Sorry again about the heat but luckily it was solved quickly) Hi Chris, thank you for your feedback. I am very sorry that you have experienced this inconvenience. The issues have been resolved and hopefully you will be able to return to the apartment and experience the difference. You are welcome anytime! Hi Tien-Tien! Thanks for your long and detailed feedback, reviews like this help us out so much! We're really happy you loved the great location and our responsive communication, we are going to work on making the check-in run smoother for next time, sorry about our delay. Thanks again and hope we can have you back again someday! -Team Iamb&b Thanks for the kind words Umay! -Team Iamb&b Hi Nina! Thanks for your feedback about your stay. I'm sorry you felt deceived about the stairs, I've added an extra note on the listing so guests can be extra aware there are many steep stairs to climb. Unfortunately steep stairs are quite characteristic of Amsterdam. I've put a note to make sure our hosts explain the lock better, apologies for any confusion. We're happy you enjoyed the great location and layout of the apartment! -Team Iamb&b We loved having you Krystle! :) please come back anytime! -Team Iamb&b Hi Amelie! Thanks for your review and we're very sorry about the issues about the shower. We tried to clean, put product down the drain and call a handyman but he wasn't available. Next time we will try to be quicker when following up with issues. We are happy you did enjoy the apartment once you were moved! Thanks again for your constructive feedback :) -Team Iamb&b Sounds like you had a blast! And the stairs do keep you in shape ;) come back anytime Diana! We're happy you loved the fabulous location! :) hopefully we can host you agains soon! Thanks Audrey! :) It was a pleasure hosting you Jason! Thanks Lesley, it was great to host you!  Hi Tim,<br/>Thanks for your feedback! Sorry to hear that you had to pick up the keys, normally we always do a personal check in in front of the door of the apartment! And with the luggage it can be a challenge, the walking. Will make sure we give more detailed estimated travel time to the future guests! Hope to see you again soon in Amsterdam! Thanks Abbie! Hope to see you again soon in Amsterdam!  Hi leo, thanks for your feedback! Hope to host you again soon in Amsterdam! The drainage problem is solved :)  Hi Ann-Marie, <br/><br/>Thank you very much for this review. It is always nice to hear how our guests experience the apartments. However, we are Iamb&b, this is a separate service from Airbnb. We mentioned to you several times that the host was having a delay, sorry for that. "

Amsterdam is very expensive country, it was the cheapest one, that why you came here.. Next time you can go to hostel, it's more expensive than my house... <br/>Anyway... Have fun<br/>.. I didn't have chance to say goodbye... Thanks to stay in my house!"
53966656,"Thanks Eveliina, for your nice review! Due to road works during your stay, the tram to the center took longer than usual. For our future guests it is important to know that the city center is a bit closer. The tram to the Leidseplein takes 9 minutes, to the Dam square, it is normally only 11 minutes, according to Google Maps :-)"

Furthermore it is one of the most quiet neighbourhoods of Amsterdam and one of the few places where you can still park your car for free"
57378136,"The Wolvenstraat apartment is a classic, old Amsterdam apartment, but obviously not for everyone,  the majority of 5 star reviews are testament to its desirability, character and location in the heart of the city.

58083795,"Hi Sean,<br/>I'm sorry you've experienced this and have a bad memory to your Amsterdam trip. I hope in the end you still enjoyed it.<br/>When you texted me about your own preferred check-in time I immediately texted you that the check-in time could be as early as 12:30 as I had guests leaving. Unfortunately I did not hear back from you until the morning of your arrival date. I have a flexible check in at my listing and I always try to accommodate my guests to their wishes but sometimes it is just not possible to have everything ready at the time you want to. You asked Airbnb to cancel your reservation which they did after a long talk and discussion. And you've received a full refund. You did not really communicate with me at all, I could have offered to store your luggage for you or even give you the keys already. <br/>I'm sorry it did not work out, I do hope you still had a pleasant stay in Amsterdam despite the beginning.<br/>Best,<br/>Fleur Hi Cristina, thank you for your feedback. I am sorry that you have had this experience.  It was an unfortunate misunderstanding that there were workers in te first place as I explained to you during check in. I have kept in touch with you during your stay to make it as comfortable as possible. When you indicated that the workers caused a problem I have send them away. You stated afterwards that everything was ok and that there was nothing I could do to make your stay more enjoyable. Again I am very sorry to hear that it caused so much trouble for you, this is defiantly not how you should feel staying at my place or any other place for that matter."

I will change it today :-) Thank you Omg. You give this reviewed, when I have let you stayed with an extra person the you bring to the house with out informing me and lie to me ?  And I didnt ask you for pay for this person. <br/>It's really unbelievable. Hi Delphine. Thank you for your message. <br/>In the description, you know the size of the bed, all the previous guests never complain about it Any time. You are more than welcome here :-) Its true no AC but house have fan, also in the case is needed an extra fan or something I can help to my guests feels more comfortable, feel free to share with me and I will try my best to help, regarding the location is depending on the way people see it, for some peole 45-50 minutes walk is fine, otherwise by tram 15-20 mi utes maximal. You have a really good sons, your welcome and a big thank to them back, for take care so good the house, friendly and see how they take care each other. Thanks guys.

58813481,"HI Suzan thanks for the feedback ,its a shame you didn't mention any of these comments when you stayed with us ,we always request guests to tell us any issues immediately so we can try to fix things ,we are sorry that you could not deduct from the pictures the size of the studio and bathroom .We indeed do not have a airconditioning but  we also do not list one.We could have supplied you with a extra fan if only you had asked ,as to your issue with the distance to the centre of the city i think you only have to look at the other reviews that we are indeed in the center ,if in doubt check the map of amsterdam and you can see where we are in relation to the edge of the city,in relation to the noise issue ,there were some children playing during the day on the water but its always quiet at night but of course we are not in the middle of a forest ,best regards Stevin and Jol Thanks for your great review Steven and Joan. It was great to have you as guests. Enjoy the rest of your holiday and a safe trip home! thanks Rick for the tip.There is a little shaving mirror in the bathroom,but we try now to attache one the wall"

60711286,"Hi Meabh, too bad you missed going through the house manual, because I listed all the restaurants and supermarkets that are within walking distance in there and also the best way to use the public transport that will take you to the city center in much less time. Hopefully you enjoyed the new year celebration and had a good time after all. Sadly it is possible on Airbnb for guests to threaten hosts to give bad reviews if they don't pay out a full refund. A good try, but I do not bend for extortion. I hope other hosts will be alarmed reading this and that future guests can see by reading all other reviews that this review is obviously a 100% false. It was to be expacted, but I am still amazed by your review. Nowhere in our advertisement it says we provide 2 bikes (and it never has), it just says the place is close to bike rental shops. About the hob, that's right and we explained to you before already, we had to take it out recently because of very strict regulations by the city. We instead put free breakfast, free, wine, free snacks for you to make up for the mmissing hot plate. After using our place for a few hours and you started to sent messages I came to you immidiately and knocked your door to solve the problems you experience, but you refused to open the door for me and then sent me a message to say you don't want to speak to me in person but only to airbnb. We gladly refunded you the full amount, but still you stayed more time in our apartment ( I guess it wasn't so bad after all) leaving us to clean every single room again after you left, including used bedding and dirty dishes. I really don't know what to say.... Hi Celine, we are so sorry you didn't like your stay and I really like to apologise for all shortcomings you stumbled upon. Having that said I would like to add that when you asked me about the heating I offered you to have someone check it out, but immidiately you answered that is was already working perfectly fine, that's why I didn't sent someone over. Also I didn't respond to your very angry whatsapp message you sent me at 1am because I was asleep at this hour and I saw your message to my sursprise only in the morning and really not knowing what happened, so I am very sorry for any inconvience that night. I sincerely hope that you and your husband somehow still managed to enjoy this beautiful sunny and warm spring week in Amsterdam. Hi Marie, so sorry you  were under the impression we provide bicycles for guests. In our advertisement it clearly says ""Very close to bicycle rental shops"". I don't see how that is dishonest. It is true we provided those in the past and people have written about it in reviews, but as a host we are not entitled to remove any reviews, that wouldn't be fair. Hola, Antonia, l√°stima que tu estancia haya sido decepcionante. Sin embargo, me gustar√≠a decir que hemos resuelto el problema de la bicicleta en el plazo de un d√≠a por nuestra cuenta, a nuestro propio costo, mientras que en realidad usted es responsable de eso si destruye las bicicletas. La descripci√≥n tambi√©n establece claramente que no estamos en el centro y que el transporte p√∫blico al centro demora un m√°ximo de 20 minutos y eso es completamente correcto, no s√© qu√© tipo de transporte ha tomado y que esto ha fallado.<br/>Tambi√©n es posible que entre una ara√±a del jard√≠n si deja la puerta abierta, no podemos cambiar tanto. Tal vez mantenga las ventanas y puertas cerradas, pero entiendo que no es agradable con esta temperatura alta. We are so sorry that your vacation is ruined, we really tried to make your stay a pleasant one. After requesting to buy new lamps late at night, we did go to the night shop and bought you new ones and replaced it that same night. We did turned up the heat for you up to 26 C. The bathroom has plenty of body wash, shampoo, toothpaste, combs, conditioner, razors, shower caps, body lotion etc, all was still full after you left. There are 4 extra blankets in the bedroom cupboard. In our advertisement, the size of the apartment is correctly mentioned, also the fact that is a part of a 3 story house, it is not inside another apartment and definitely not in the basement (!) Also the washing machine is crossed out in the amenity list, meaning we don't have one. The kitchen and including appliances, is completely newly fitted only 2 months ago, we think it is unreasonable to already replace it. Somehow we fail to see how it is relevant what an apartment costs in Italy on the other side of Europe? Hi Omar, there is a bus stop going to Jordaan district, 1 minute walk away, you can see it from the bedroom window. I am afraid you used another one where also the tram stops much further away. So sorry about that, but we hope to see you again. You were a fantastic guest!"
61401345,Thanks for your positive review! It was nice having you. Thanks for your positive review! It was nice having you. Fijn om te horen dat u een fijne tijd hebt gehad. <br/>Wel spijtig om te horen dat de afvoer het niet goed deed en dat u hier last van heeft gehad.

We hebben na de eerste nacht gevraagd of alles in orde was en u heeft dit ons niet aangegeven. <br/>Volgende keer gewoon doen want we staan met een team vol liefde voor u klaar Thanks for your positive review! And I am glad to hear that the key issue was not a big problem for you. Thank you so much for your positive review. It was nice having you! Thanks for your positive review! It was nice having you! quick and calm! <br/>Definitely not my last time there!
61413189,"Hi Christopher, sorry about the temperatures. It has been exceptionally warm the days before (33C). We are happy to hear that you had a pleasant stay in our house. Pieter and Hanny Leslie and his family were fine guests. Really recommandable"
61450024,"Hi Fede, <br/><br/>Sorry to hear you had some difficulties. It is a pity you didn't fill in the address details i sent you and that you used the zippcode instead. Also you arrived hours later than you told me. I can't be at home all day as i also work. That's why it is nice to communicate arrival hours on time. <br/><br/>When you enter a zippcode instead of a house number you don't arrive of course. And who's then to blame? Everybody always finds my apartment very easy if they read the instructions carefully. I hope you had a great stay and wish you both all the best. I am a superhost on airbnb and I like people, but this time I asked them to leave and find another place to stay. <br/><br/>I find it surprising to read this message. <br/><br/>When you say you arrive between 14-15 max 16 you can inform the host if you are late. Especially if you are at an AirPort or trainstation. There is wifi everywhere and as you both had super new phones that should not be a problem at all. <br/><br/>Then you said: i don‚Äôt have your number. What you get with a confirmation. <br/><br/>I also did not swear at all, I just told you in a direct way that I don‚Äôt like this disrespecful behavior and because of that I didn‚Äôt accept you in my house. <br/><br/>You were supposed to stay one night. You told me stories that changed all the time. In the meantime I sent you several messsages from 16 and still no reply. <br/><br/>In the meantime I contacted Airbnb and I told this is not ok and it was ok to not accept them. I discussed the matter with them and they supported me. <br/><br/>Then you arrived at 21 not 20. Bothered my neighbour and rang the wrong doorbell. They clearly didn‚Äôt read my instructions also. You know what is said and done, I told you to leave as I also have my limits, it is your choice to say things that are not true and that is fine with me. Wish you all the best in life and I hope you communicate better during future travels, because this was unacceptable for me. And also the way you stood at my door was strange. Like you visited a coffeeshop first. Thanks for your feedback! I am sorry for the housekeeping, will pay more attention next time I am away. (I was on a holiday and asked a friend to do it this time). Hope you enjoyed your stay. greetings Anne"

61506345,Thank you Jane for the nice review. We are very happy to hear you had a good time in our house and Amsterdam. And thank you very much for the tip about the pillows. we will offer different pillows from now on.
61540500,"Thank you for your review. I'm glad you enjoyed the beautiful views and clean accommodations. As mentioned in the listing, the distance to the city center is clearly stated. <br/>If you have any questions or need further clarification, please don't hesitate to reach out before booking. Sorry to hear that the accommodation somehow didn't meet your high expectation. I hope you will read and check the listing thoroughly before making the reservation in the future! I am sorry that you could not find your way easily. But I need to reply on your review since this is incorrect.<br/>There are more than enough places who are selling alcohol within 200-300 meters from my house. They are: <br/>Four supermarkts = AH, Jumbo, DekaMarkt, Dirk van den Broek.<br/>Alcohol shops =  Gall & Gall, Serhan Nightshop. <br/>Bars/ restaurants =  Caf√© Zomerlust, Caf√© Plein '40-'45, Bar Content. I am sorry you had beyond expectation outside what I could offer. As you could have read, my AirBnb pofile is listed as private room, which means not 100% privacy since we will have to share the space. <br/> <br/>I myself live and mostly work from home. However, I have provided you with full access of the apartment. You used the living room most of time and even used my kitchen every evening :-) <br/>I definitely recommend you to choose 'whole apartment' when you book on AirBnb in the future. To clarify this review to the readers:<br/><br/>Claudio moved to Amsterdam and planned to start his new life. The fact that he didn‚Äôt have much money, I felt pity and I was agreed on his proposal by helping him with many things such as: giving  him much discounts for a longer stay and even allowed him to use my address to be registered at the municipality of Amsterdam, etc. <br/><br/>Surprisingly, later on, he himself changed his mind and didn‚Äôt want to commit to the agreement that was previously made nor to take any consequences from it. I felt totally being cheated and aggrieved. But still, I gave him a fair solution considering his financial situation. In fact, he didn‚Äôt care at all and simply was not happy with this solution and told me that he will destroy my Airbnb reputation. And this is the reason of this bad review.<br/><br/>WARNING to every Airbnb hosts: <br/>Please be very careful to do any business with this person. He is someone who does not how to thank, and instead he will stab you from behind. Do not trust him at all! It was my pleasure to host you + friends. <br/>Unfortunately, I do not have much control over the price since that is the price recommended by Airbnb for Amsterdam standard (incl. tax + their commisson fee). Actually, if you did research, you will find out that the price is equal to the hostel price in Amsterdam. <br/>It is also important to notice that my guest have always full access throughout the entire apartment. Dear Audrey, <br/>Thank you for your stay and review. I am sorry that you experienced my hospitality as a little too much and the vibrant borough as too far from the centre. My quiet apartment has great views and ample public transportation for Amsterdam standards to both the center and the airport which goes frequently,  every 5 to 15 minutes, depending the time of day including the night buses. Hi Artur, thanks for your feedback and I am really sorry that you didn't have a pleasant experience with the shower. I am sure I have mentioned how you can solve it and get on with it. And you could have mentioned to me if you still didnt succeed with it. <br/>Meanwhile I will ask another company to look at into this problem. Thanks.<br/>Kindly regards, Riza Thank you very much for the review.  It was my pleasure to host you and I am really sorry if I cannot please you by providing the typical ukranian breakfast (such as vegetables and eggs). But as you can read on my profile I only provide standard western breakfast such as milk, tea/coffee, cereal, fruits, jams, cheese and bread. And so far people are very happy about it. Thank you for your kind comments, Alexander. It was a pleasure to have you home!<br/>Yes, as mentioned home maybe a distance from the center. Having said that, the frequent trams 7&14, from here leads you directly into the main square/ dam 25 minutes at the most.<br/>So you can enjoy the best of both worlds, Amsterdam's bustling center plus the relaxed greenery of our neighbourhood. Hope to have you back soon with us! How are u? Thank you Ceica For your feedback. I have changed the bath line now :-)<br/><br/>Have a good day!xxx"

62255142,"Hi Marcela,<br/>This is Simon. I'm very sorry you had that bad experience. <br/>On this occasion we used an agency to manage the communication and check-in & -out, since we were away for Christmas, so it wasn't me that you dealt with, it was this agency.   My sincere apologies for what happened - we are not using that agency any more. Merci pour votre avis! Encore d√©sol√© pour le m√©nage - nous avions d√ª partir pour nos vacances avant de pouvoir l'inspecter et c'est la premi√®re fois que cela n'a pas √©t√© fait √† un bon niveau. Simon & Nicolette Thanks for your nice review. Next time we will be in time for the check-out. After you have called us we immediately send a host to the apartment for the check-out, but at that time you already left the apartment. Sorry for the inconvenience. "

63345467,"Dear Madeleine, thank you for the wonderful 5 star rating. The WiFi normally works perfectly and is really fast. I am sorry to hear you had any issues due to a technical malfunction in the area. Thank you for your review. There are many ways to get to the city center from the apartment and only a 2 minutes walk to multiple trams, busses and even the subway is a 5 minute walk. Public transportation in Amsterdam is everywhere and 24/7 available. Also i provide the option to rent a bicycle if you like to experience Amsterdam to the fullest. Hi Scott, I noticed the group of boys hanging in front of the apartment and send them away at a certain point. Normally that doesn‚Äôt happen. It was a random group that didn‚Äôt belong to the pizza place. Sorry to hear about the inconvenience. Joe and his girlfriend were great guests and should be welcome anywere!<br/>"
63459419,Thank you so much for your nice comments. I hope you had a very nice stay in Amsterdam. Kind regards to you and your girlfriend.
63916400,"Thanks Erin, for your stay. You are welcome back any time and hopefully we'll meet then! Hi Cyriaque, thanks for your review. We'll be taking everything into account, but breakfast wasn't included in the stay and you can also find that information in my listing. Luckily Amsterdam has loads of good breakfast places to choose from! Best, Foke Thanks Egor! You are welcome back any time."

Hi Judy,<br/>You are really the first having remarks for the instructions,  but I must say, never thought about it, your are absolutely right!  I wil do my best to make something accordingly!<br/>Frank Rose, <br/>I would like to commend: I called James as I had a problem : I asked him if you would allow me to pick up forgotten cloth which was  still in my drawer. That's the first time I forgot something during my airbnb time!  I also could have picked up later when you we there, but he told me he did not mind at all! Next time you simply don't accept if you feel uncomfortable and say no, I will of course respect! Not any  reason not to, but now I have a complain in which I can't recognize myself, sorry. <br/>Richard was standing outside in the garden and I asked him if he would like the bench to sit on, as the weather was  very nice. I took it out of my girlfriends (next door) garden house. You rent my house and take care of it,  you have all freedom and I want the best for my airbnb guests to have the best time! Hope to see you next time! Best regards, Frank Nice to hear you felt good in the apartment! Thanks Jean Pablo!<br/>I checken the switch on bedroom, iT was indeed not switched on. Next time you come I Will Make sure the hole house is warm! And make site there Will be enough wine "
64596266,"It was a pleasure hosting you both Ralph, thanks for staying and the honest review. Most guests here use our free bikes, that's included in the room price. And then.. Rijksmuseum is only 8 minutes by bike ;-)). Usually guest do not take extra stuff out of lockers without asking, but they do open windows ;-) .. but you were friendly simple people to host. What a bummer you did not tell us personally what you thought we could have done better. Some people do not, obviously. One  always wonders why. But it's a free world, that's a good thing. Christina and the two 18 year olds are friendly shopping, shopping, and buying buying a lot, a lot, a lot of things folks. The room had to be aired for a while due to the sensation of weed, bummer. Dear Airbnb Travellers, please ignore this post and read all others. <br/>Steffen is a weird and non-communicative person. See other host-review of Steffen. After 12 days his  room was really dirty, messy and particularly smelly. There was no choice,. it had to be cleaned. Sheets had to be changed. We could not live here in the dirt and smell for another week. Steffen's stay was for almost 3 long, long weeks. A pity, because the other 80 bookings in the previous year were great fun, for us and for guests. Thanks for the review and the supercute note!! The dancing session was awesome. The boys & I really enjoyed you company. You are welcome anytime! Haha! Thank you Johanna for your kind words. <br/>Sorry for the messy check in - I never was so badly prepared, because I thought you‚Äôd arrive two hours later ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. <br/>Hope to meet again and ‚Ä¶ sweet hugs for all of you from my son Fabulous! Solal,<br/>You do not tell the truth.<br/>You smoked weed all day on a playground for children during day time. <br/>You did not take the first warning not to do so, of a friendly neighbour, serious. <br/>You did get your money back for the nights you did not stay (flexible cancellation terms are applied to my add). <br/>Your complaint at the airbnb helpcenter has been put aside.  <br/>You as an adult buy drugs for minors (weed = 18+ only) which could get you into pretty nasty trouble in the Netherlands. <br/>I always try to be so explicit as I can to inform (all) guests (of a group) beforehand. <br/>This is the text I sent to all four guest of Solal‚Äôs group on their cell-phones before they arrived (which you can also find in the house rules of my add on the airbnb website):<br/>‚ÄúSmoking weed is not allowed. Not in the house, not in the garden, not in front of the house nor in the street. Go to Beatrixpark or Sarphatpark. Or to the square opposite the apartment (when all kids are gone!).<br/>(NB: the square is 6 meters away from my front door. The huge square is a playground for children. In daytime there are always children)<br/>Be aware I live here for 25 years - a complaint from my neighbours means I have to end the booking directly. My neighbours are pretty reasonable, be nice to them and they‚Äôll be nice to you. ‚Äú<br/>A neighbour found (smelled) Solal‚Äôs group smoking weed in front of my door to the street, a few hours after they arrived, sometime after noon. He friendly asked them not to. At a later moment Solal and his group were found smoking weed again there. My neighbour told them not to, again, and called me to tell, since I was out at the time. I spoke personally to Solal‚Äôs 16 year old sister to ask whether my neighbour was right (and, to her credit) she confirmed that my neighbour was telling the truth. <br/>Sorry Solal, this is not a scandal but a normal response to unresponsable behaviour in multiple ways. Thank you Ricardo, it was a real pleasure hosting you! Being an airbnb host is like being a chef in a restaurant where the menu holds just one meal. 95% of guests only come to eat ones, and all guests have seen only pictures of the menu. Around 90% of my airbnb guests love the menu and star my place the maximum 5 stars for over three years now. But as my mam used to say when one of the kids didn‚Äôt like the dinner she cooked for us: I cannot cook a meal everyone likes just as much every day.  Thank you Alexandra, as an extra spot to chill out it is really a great plus of living here. You are welcome to stay anytime!  Thanks Rado, you are welcome here anytime! My boys loved you! "
64641365,"Dear potential guest,<br/>This review of Lina is written when I told her she had to leave the apartment with her 3 other friends. I only rent the apartment to two persons. I explained to her that when she brings more people to stay in my apartment she has to ask for permission first, which she didn't. I never allow 4 people to stay in my apartment, because I know 4 young people want to party during the night and I don't allow that. I need to respect my neighbors. This is a very nice neighborhood with bars around the corner, but the street of my apartment is quiet, so you can sleep during the night and I and my neighbors want to keep it that way. So you are more than welcome to stay in my apartment with two people and rely on a good night rest! :-)<br/>(and don't worry, the apartment doesn't have paper thin walls.... :-) Sophia was a nice guest, till the day I told her she had to pay extra for the extra 2 guests who were sleeping in my house without asking before. Normally it takes me 1,5 hour to clean the house, now it took me 4,5 hours. Than she accused me of having dirty sheets on the beds, which is really a mean thing to say, because I have always clean sheets on my beds. So when you think somebody is nice  it can all of a sudden change, because they don't want to pay extra for inviting extra guests without telling you! I have had this experience twice now in a short period, with people who invite extra people without telling me. Airbnb advices all the hosts to purchase a CCTV camera outside the building so you can show evidence. It is not enough evidence anymore that it is obvious that my two couches were used. The extra pillows, sheets and blankets in the house (I have 6!) were still on the couches. And I feel very sad that although I give a great service with extra's (free bikes, museum passes with free entrance to all the museums in the Netherlands and fresh beers in the fridge) that people still think they need to lie to you in order to save 10 euro."
64676158,"Hi Anika and Jose, good to hear you had a great time in Amsterdam. The season is perfect for renting a bike! The bus stop taking you to central station is just a one minute walk from my house, while the tram stop to leidse square and museum square is 3 minutes walking from my house. Just so know next time you visit, because you're always welcome to stay again! Thank you Taylor, you are welcome any time to visit again! No problem Victor, it was a pleasure hosting you. You are welcome any time to stay again! Cheers Vincent, you are always welcome to stay again! You're welcome Luis. It was a pleasure having you over! Thank you Karim, it was nice having you over. Hope to see you again soon as well. If you want to stay again you're always welcome! Thnx Ivan, you guys are welcome any time! Thnx Alfio, I hope you had a great time in Amsterdam! You're welcome to stay any time! Thnx Manon, you're welcome to stay any time! Cheers Nicolas, in case you're ever in Amsterdam again, you're always welcome to stay! Thanks Miria, you're welcome any time to visit again! Thank you Renaud, it was a pleasure having you. You're more than welcome to come over any time. Hi Eddy, I'm sorry to hear you had different expectations of the apartment. I do realise it can be a bit small for a group of six. That's why I clearly state in the desctiption that my apartment is perfect for a couple, suitable for 4 people and max. 6 people. I only accept 6 people because people often don't want to split up.<br/>You surprise me little bit with your review as you seemed perfectly happy when we met. Again, I'm regret to hear it wasn't what you expected. I hope you had a nice time in Amsterdam nonetheless. Hi Matthieu, good to hear you had a good time in Amsterdam. I'm sorry the apartment didn't entirely live up to your expectations. The description on my profile describes there is one bed in the bedroom and two airbeds in the living room; perfect for a couple, suitable for 4 people, max 6. So I don't completely understand what you found inaccurate in the description. Is there anything I can do to make you feel better? In any case you are more than welcome to stay with a smaller group next time. Best regards, Pim Hi R√©mi, you're always welcome to stay. I hope we do meet in person next time! Thnx Sebastian, you're welcome any time! Thanks David it was a pleasure having you and great to meet you guys! I hope you had an excellent stay in Amsterdam. And thank your buddy for helping me fix my bike :-) Cheers Akira, I hope you enjoyed your stay! You're always welcome to stay in apartment again :-) It was nice meeting you guys Jenny. You're welcome any time! Thank you for your message Marius. Good to hear you had a great time! I am sorry my order for the new airbed didn't arrive before you guys came to stay. Towels and blankets you could find in the closet. I would have been more than glad to answer any questions by whatsapp or through the airbnb message service. However, I will make sure I will provide even better information for my next guests. So thanks again for the feedback and if you decide to visit Amsterdam again, you're more than welcome! Thanks for the feedback Christophe. I sincerely apologise for the pillow and the food in the fridge, the cleaner must have missed it.<br/>As regards the air mattress it is mentioned in the advertisement that I have one double bed in the bedroom and one double air mattress in the living room. Nevertheless, I will purchase a self inflating airbed for my next guests.  Thnx Sophia! In case you ever come to visit  Amsterdam again you're most welcome to stay over Thank you Harani and thank you for your feedback! I'll make sure to arrange for some extra blankets for my next guests."

65198722,"Thank you for your honesty. <br/>I am sorry I couldn't convince you about the thorough construction of the bunk beds, built by my husband and professional cabinet maker. We had already many guest before you using the beds and even our youngest son is now taller than 175 cm.<br/>We are indeed not a hotel and provide with our home a whole different feel and comfort. As you mentioned; our place could be described as artistic.<br/>I'm happy you found the linen, kitchen and bath clean and loved the cats (thanks again for your good care).<br/> I trust you had a great time in Amsterdam as part of your extensive trip and a good journey home. Hi Gray, Thanks for your kind words! You are more than welcome to stay again sometime! Almost forgot: I must send you greetings from my cats! It was a pleasure to host you Thomas! Would like to see you in Amsterdam again. Highly recommended guest!"
65203498,"Too bad the advertisement was not read properly. The description of the accommodation states that there are a number of steep stairs. <br/>Indeed, the toilet in the room itself has a hand pump because it is the historic ship's toilet.<br/>The shower with toilet has an automatic pump.<br/>The WiFi was indeed broken and I discussed this with the guests, but they did not mind.<br/>I finally fixed the WiFi. Yes, they started new construction work at the railways this week.<br/>It was new for me aswell. I am sorry I didn't explain you about the extra heating."

66705909,"Wow.. i had to take a little time to process your review, i'm totally shocked after your, sort of, accusation and everything i did for you and your friends. You make me loose trust in people and new quests. Yes, during the time Elodee stayed in the apartment, there was a break-in. Something that can happen everywhere unfortunately.. I was there within 30 minutes, helped you with everything you needed and booked and paid a hotel for you and your friends for 4 night because i felt so terrible. We were so kind to each other every time i talked to you in that 4 days and you had never made me believe that you thought i had anything to do with it. If you just had told me something, instead of being so kind, i would have talked to the police myself.. I also cannot believe why you wright that i wasn't available at the 25th or that i have asked you to not wright a review about this, that shocks me the most. I am an honest person and to read your accusation really hurts! I believed you immediately when you said you were sure to locked the door, if you have lied to my face for over 4 days, how can i be sure then? Not only your belongings but also the play station from the apartment was stolen and the tv was broken.<br/><br/>I truly believe that i was really there for you after this terrible moment, changed the locks immediately and brought you to another hotel/apartment in the middle of the night. If anyone has questions about this review, they can always ask me anything they need to know before booking."
67438219,Thank you for staying with us Arielle! We were very happy with you and Peter as our guests as well! Thank you Mariam! Glad you enjoyed it here. You were very nice guests and thank you for taking care of the house!

67729845,"Thanks Steve! It has been hard keeping plants alive because of the light but I do keep trying. Am open to suggestions about which plants might grow well there! Hi Carlos, I'm sad to hear you were disappointed with the listing. It is indeed a basement and the title (Basement@Centre/Jordaan) of the advertisement already says it is a basement so I'm not sure what you were expecting. About the TV, I was not aware that it stopped working so thanks for mentioning that. I will get into it. Hope that all things put aside you had a good time in Amsterdam! Hi Lucy, thanks for your feedback! I really appreciate it. Maybe it's time for a new mattress. It does get used a lot. I will get a new one :) And sorry about the wifi. I was not aware it didn't work. There have been some issues with the internet in the street. Apologies again for the other guests in my b&b. I hung up the stickers because apparently some people don't read the house rules properly. They will not get a good review I can assure you. I'm really sorry you felt invaded in your privacy. We are a b&b and so  I think it is quite usual that the owners go into the spaces if needed. That is also how I discovered the other guests had  been smoking weed and so it does serve a purpose. I hope you understand! Hi Jan!!  Yes, weather has been pretty extreme for A'dam!!!  Everyone is talking about it.  Sorry, but  many original buildings in A'Dam do not have air conditioning - warm periods only last for a short period.   Come back in the off summer season ;)<br/>W<br/> Hi Susie, good point about the skylight. I have ordered a curtain to hang in front of it so that guests will no longer be bothered by it. Thanks again for your stay:)"
67777772,I'm really sorry that the visit did not meet your expectations. We have honored every additional request you made and we had good communication. But we could not give the very high refund you are asking for because the maid had no problems with the washing machine an hour before your arrival or afterwards. The smell in the house I really don t recognize and I never heard that before. Despite  everything thanks  for your feedback!

68040267,"PLEASE DISREGARD THE ABOVESTATED REVIEW ‚Äì IT IS NOT BASED ON FACTS.<br/><br/>I recently hosted Hector in my 'Luxurious apartment in Amsterdam'. I left the appartment in mint condition, properly cleaned and equipped with everything one can need. At first everything seemed all right with my guest Hector. We communicated friendly. And at arrival he was very happy with how the apartment looked. <br/><br/>However, after i inspected the apartment after checkout, i found that Hector left the apartment in a terrible state. He spilled candle wax all over my floor, there were grease/candle wax/red wine spots all over my couch, table and wall. Besides that hector broke the showerhead and threw away bed linnen. He also smoked a lot (weed and cigarettes) inside, even though smoking was explicitly forbidden. I found large amounts of ashes everywhere in my house, even in my bed. There was even a bag of harddrugs (and condoms) in my bed. Next to this, the smell of smoke was really bad and persistent. <br/><br/>The day after concluding this, i made a request for extra payment, for the replacement of the broken/disappeared things and for extra cleaning. in this request I expressed my disappointment to Hector. Probably as a retaliation, Hector drafted his review. He gave me 1-star in all categories, except for the location. Which suggests that the apartment was dirty, the communication poor and so on. He added the feedback that I responded slowly and that I was late. However, this all isn't true. On the contrary, the apartment was very clean, I responded very quickly on all his messages, I was in time at all our meetings. I really did my absolute best and delivered top dollar service. Which I always do, as could be seen in my previous reviews, which are all good. For example: I have been a superhost. To conclude, Hector's entire review is not based on facts.<br/><br/>I feel sad about hosting Hector as this is my first bad experience with a guest on Airbnb."
68338234,"Hi Anita, <br/>Thanks for your review, I am just a bit shocked to see a 2 for accuracy which is unfortunate. In regards to the doors for the garden they can not be opened indeed due to noise challenges and is an agreement with the neighborhood to keep them closed. Hope to host you again in the future. Hi Rosie, thanks for the review we are looking forward to hosting you again in the future. All the best Hi Tom, Thanks for the review we highly appreciate it and look forward to hosting you again in the future. Hi Sam, <br/>Thanks for your review. We have reviewed the case with the property manager and seems that there are deviations with what you mentioned versus the reality. <br/> The property indeed is suitable for 17 guests and we have prepared the amount of beds accordingly, this is for sustainability reasons. In terms of additional guests that is always possible unfortunately no heads up was provided therefore the bed was not prepared accordingly. For additional guests there is indeed an additional fee only after the 8th guest.  As you can imagine with such a large property a base price needs to be placed. <br/>During your stay the property managers were in contact with you on a few occasions. During these calls there was good communication which is the opposite of what you stipulate in your review in terms of dirt, sand and soap. Our cleaners are very thorough in there job and run through a check list prior to guests checking in. What I would advise if this does happen to you again in the future to take pictures as proof and let the management company know right away this way they can support on the situation. <br/>Wishing you all the best. Hi Anthony, <br/>Thanks for your review we were happy to host you. <br/>Hope to host you again in the future. Hi Xavier<br/><br/>It is compulsory at our property to have a personal check in this way we can also support you if you have any questions about the property or anything regarding your trip. It is clearly stipulated within our property profile that if you come after certain hours additional fees will be charged for the host. <br/><br/>Regarding the ID we have informed that you should take it out of the safe. As informed by the cleaner it seemed that you were in a bit of a rush. Our cleaner was at the property at 10:40 am if support was required with bags etc they would have helped out. Further, it seems that you had a few challenges but only communicate this afterward which I find a bit disturbing and not true. <br/><br/>For future stays, I would strongly advise having more clear communication to avoid such experiences. Hi Yonatan, <br/><br/>Thanks for your comment just to clarify on a few points. There is floor heating which is why you did not see any radiators. When we came by to support we realized that the windows were open which is why it took longer for the property to warm up. Further regarding the key we left this in the common room for you but you were not able to locate as someone has placed a tray over it unfortunately. All in all we hope you enjoyed your stay in Amsterdam. Dear Zaman, we are happy that you enjoyed your stay.  You will always be a welcome guest! Hai, it's always a pleasure seeing you.

I am glad to hear that expect the narrow hallways and a ""not so big"" common room, you were happy with your stay! I would gladly see you return! Best Happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay Cheng! Happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay Prasath! Our host always meets you at the apartment for the check-out, sorry to hear there was confusion about that, will make sure to pay attention to this in the future. Let me know when you're back in town! Thank you for your review. Getting feedback from my guests is always important, whether it is negative or positive. I am deeply sorry that the apartment wasn't properly cleaned when you arrived. As a professional property management company we always strife to provide our guests with excellent sevice, which includes a clean apartment on arrival and a professional check-in. My apologies that this didn't was the case during your stay. The reason that it's not allowed to open the windows on the backside is because there were many problems with noise disturbance in the past. Of course, it's not my intention to abstain you from fresh air, but I do hope you will understand this as I would like to keep good relationship with the neighbours. I take your comments very seriously and I take these into account with my staff. Despite the inconvenience, I really hope you enjoyed your stay in Amsterdam. Thank you for taking the time writing me a review! It is very useful to me to improve in the future! <br/>First of all, I am very sorry to hear that the host was not reachable by phone. He should have been there at the exact time that you discussed. He might have been in a rush while checking you in, because many check-ins are around the same time and he has to hurry to another location. Of course this is not an excuse not to answer your questions on the spot. I am sure he did care, that is why he advised to better call the office for further answers.<br/>Mostly, I am very sorry that you have been bothered by housekeepers going in and out the apartment. The reason for this is that the whole building is hosting guests in all apartments and the Mansion has a small storage to store linen and cleaning supplies. I am trying to find a solution for storing these elsewhere; however, until then I will definitely talk with the housekeepers to always knock first. I am surprised that this did not happen and I would like to sincerely apologies for it. It was not my intention to make you feel uncomfortable during your stay and I regret to hear that this was the case. Thank you so much! Awesome Dan! Great Melissa! Let me know when you are planning to come again ;) Thanks Charles! You can cook at eat in the common area, but otherwise there are also a lot of great places nearby in Leidseplein! You're welcome Stephen! Windows are indeed closed because of our permit. I cannot rent it out otherwise. These are legal rules. But I am glad you liked it so much! Thank you so much Louise. It is indeed partly in the basement, but has a lot of windows. They cannot be opened as these are the rules of my renting license. I am glad you liked it and you're happy to come again! Sorry to hear that Georg, it is however not possible to create windows in the dining area. But there are plenty of stairs to sit near the windows if you like! You can move them around as you like ;)  Thanks Yair for your lovely review! Not sure what you mean by smoking is not restricted. It is not allowed to smoke inside, though of course you can go in front of the building. The area is really safe for as far as I know, at a bigger road. Please do take care of closing the door properly. Glad you had a great stay!! Thanks Maud! The people entering, I informed you about, are my cleaners who need access to the storage room and the outside area is also not on the listing. I will go and check for the kitchen tools as there should of course be enough! Thanks for the feedback ;) Thanks so much Daniele! Come back any time ;) Thanks Andrew! Thanks Elliot! Was great to have you. Thanks Paul, it was lovely to host you! I am sorry about my cleaning staff. I had informed you that they would need access to the storage room in the hallway, but they are not supposed to make noise. I informed them right away! <br/>Hope to see you again! Hi Zoe, we put up a sign with the information about the laundry and cleaning service as they need to access the storage room in the hallway. However my host should have informed you and I reminded him to do this! Thanks for pointing it out and I am glad that you enjoyed the apartment! Thanks Simon! Especially the hot water can be a blessing in the cold Dutch winter ;) Glad you liked your stay! Hi Zachary, thanks for your comments! We fixed the heating again and will make sure to pay attention to how many beds should be made. Great to hear you had a nice stay! Always happy to help! Thanks for your stay! I am sorry to hear about your experience! We fixed the heating problem now, and everything is nice and warm again. Sorry we could not fix it earlier. <br/>We did inform you that our cleaners need to access the hallway and the storage room, they should not enter the apartment itself, so I reminded them of this. And we also notified you that the fire alarm is directly connected to the fire department as it is an old Amsterdam building. Everything for your safety! We put up a sign with information on how to turn off the sirene. <br/>I always try to make my guests feel as comfortable as possible and will improve my service with your feedback! Thank you for your stay. Thank you so much Jeff! Hope to have the privilage to host you again!  Great to read your positive review! I'm glad you've had a good time. Hope to see you soon! Thanks for being a great guest! Hi Glenn, <br/>I find it very unfortunate that you are sabotaging my listing. Firstly the property is not advertised with any elevator and I was never brought to attention that members in your group had an injured foot. The uniqueness of my property is that its a monumental building with all the old Amsterdam style features located in the heart of Amsterdam. <br/>You asked a few days into your reservation if you could change properties, I am sure you are aware its high season and on such last minute notice this is not possible as I only have 5 apartments in the complex and they were all rented out. <br/>If there was availability I would have definitely helped out but unfortunately that was not the case. I would kindly like to ask you to remove the false reviews as the property was cleaned by our professional cleaning company where we have fotos of every cleaning and this is just false review what you are writing here and not ethically correct. <br/>We will be logging a ticket as well by Airbnb to raise this case, its very unfortunate that it had to end up this way and hope you would be more transparent in the case at hand. Hi Patricia, Unfortunately what you are mentioning is not fully transparent. Before making acquisitions please support to check all topics first for the following reasons. <br/>The inbox of airbnb is shared with the property manager meaning all parties were fully aware. After review with the Property manager it was informed that they had to send a host 2 times to support with you luggage storage and the cost was not charged as indeed it was not clearly stipulated in the communication with you. <br/>It was informed that you showed up at the property without providing any indication which is why you had to unfortunately wait as informed on our terms and conditions. There is a binder in the property but maybe you have overlooked it either way you can always reach our to our 24/7 service for support incase there are any questions which our team will support accordingly. As our main focus is to provide you a home away from home feeling. <br/>The only unfortunate topic is that we are only hearing these comments after your stay and would have loved to have support you with the topics during your stay to make it a more pleasant memory. Either way we hope to host you in the future again and would like to provide you a discounted rate on your next stay. <br/>All the best Hi Salih, <br/>As airbnb agreed with us there was not enough evidence to prove there was a mouse as you decided to leave the property on day one of you check in. Might have been due to some urgencies on your end.  Its unfortunate as we had hoped to have hosted you accordingly. Hi Allison, this is not a truthful review. Firstly you did not even stay within the property and we asked for pictures and none were provided from your end. We checked right away with the cleaning company and they provided pictures that everything was cleaned accordingly up to our hotel standards. I have been hosting for several years and this is the first time I receive such a comment. Further you did not cancel the reservation and blocked my calendar. The only contact I have had with you is now via a review which is very unfortunate as our first priority is to make sure our guests are enjoying themselves. We have also reported this instance to airbnb accordingly and they fully agree with us. I would kindly like to ask you to remove this review as its not true. We will give you a weeks time before I reach out to Airbnb again to report this case. <br/>Thanks Hi Steve, thanks for the review we hope to host you again in the future. Hi Alan, <br/>Thanks for your review, its very unfortunate when guests only start to make comments when they check out and not during there stay. <br/>In regards to the keycards, they are on default blocked at the agreed check out time of 11:00 there is no exception here unless a late check out is agreed. <br/>In regards to the blind this was damaged by yourselves and also the lamps that stand 1 meter 60 cm tall were both laying sideways on the floor without the lamp shades we can guarantee this was not the case at check in. <br/>I would appreciate if you were to write truthful reviews moving forward as this is not the way to utilize such services.<br/>Wishing you all the best Hi Alastair, <br/>Thanks for your review we were happy to host you. <br/>Hope to host you again in the future. Hi Erica, <br/>Thanks for your review we were happy to host you. <br/>Hope to host you again in the future. Hi William, <br/><br/>Thanks for your review, we hope you enjoyed your stay in Amsterdam.<br/><br/>We know there were some stains which have been removed but did not see any stains of blood or other body fluid when we checked after your check out. You did only make me aware at checkout we would advise if you experienced this to inform right away as I can imagine this would not be comfortable for you. Unfortunately that was not the case did you have pictures of those concerns that you can share. Our cleaning company steams the property as part of our cleaning protocol. Hi Boaz very unfortunate to see that you provided us a 3 Star rating. Is this because we had to call you 3 times to check out of the property. The check out time as stipulated is 11:00 but you resist to leave the property very unfortunate but we hope you keep this in mind for your future stay as it does have impact on our planning Hi Jonny, Hope you have enjoyed your time in Amsterdam. Would love to host you again in the future. All the best! Hi Jeroen, thank you for the feedback. It was a pleasure hosting you! Hi Lucy! Thank you for your review. Unfortunately those steep stairs are typical Amsterdam. I hope you have enjoyed your time in Amsterdam, it was a pleasure hosting you Dear Arjun, Thank you very much for taking your time to write a review. Hope that you have enjoyed your stay in Amsterdam. It was a pleasure hosting you. Dear Anna, Thank you so much for your nice words! Hope you have enjoyed your time in Amsterdam! Dear Paul, thank you very much for writing a review. I am very happy to hear to had a good stay! Would love to host you again in the future. Dear Marycris, thank you so much for your review! Did you manage to whip up something nice in the kitchen? Would love to host you again in the future! All the best! Dear Oliver, thank you so much for taking the time to leave me such an extensive review. I am really happy with your feedback, it reminds me of why I love what I do so much!  Also the points for improvement you are suggesting are very good. Will definitely take them in consideration! Looking forward to be hosting you again in the future! All the best! Hi Christian,<br/>I'm happy to read that you had a great experience and that you enjoyed your stay at my apartment! Bnbmanager did a great job helping me host you and were always there to help you out with all your questions. It would be great if you could show them your appreciation and drop them a review on their F acebook and G oogle as well. It will only take a minute and they‚Äôd love to read about your experiences!

It would be great if you could show them your appreciation and drop them a review on their F acebook and G oogle as well. It will only take a minute and they‚Äôd love to read about your experiences! You're always welcome Lou! Thanks for the feedback Darwin! The windows can open and close, as summers can be warm and winters can be cold here in Amsterdam. If you have any issues its always important to let me know, I would have gladly helped! Happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay Bryant! Thank you for the feedback Wei! The stairs to the apartment are indeed a bit steep but I must say they're very typical for Amsterdam housing. Probably every apartment in Amsterdam has stairs like this (or even steeper)! Luckily our host is always there to help with luggage during the check-in :) Thank you so much Colton! Do come back, it was great having you :) Ow did they?! They are not supposed to, thanks for informing me! <br/>Glad to hear about your stay, would welcome you back again ;) Great Fion! Always welcome! Always happy to help! Sorry about the balcony but it is also not listed ;)  Hi Phil,<br/>Thank you for your feedback. I'm sorry to hear that your experience didn‚Äôt fully meet your expectations.<br/>You mentioned some concerns about cleanliness. Please know that the apartment is professionally cleaned before every stay, and in your case, we even sent someone again at your request. I understand you were unhappy with the bedding, but from the photo you shared, it appeared to be clean aside from a small piece of lint. Still, I took your concerns seriously and arranged for fresh sheets to be delivered right away.<br/>Regarding the check-in, the apartment operates with self check-in, and all the instructions were provided to you well in advance via email and the Airbnb app. The check-in time and process are clearly communicated, so it‚Äôs unfortunate to hear this influenced your overall rating.<br/>That said, I do hope you still had a great time exploring Amsterdam, and I appreciate you staying with us.<br/>Best regards,<br/>Marnix360Apartments team Hi Dorian, thanks for the feedback we highly appreciate it and strange there was not enough utensils at the accommodation. Please do let us know next time this way we can resupply accordingly. I have made note of this and will address towards our cleaning company accordingly thanks a lot. Hi Yasmine, thanks for the feedback we highly appreciate it and would love to host you again in the future. Hi Robin, Thanks for the review we highly appreciate it and look forward to hosting you again in the future. Hi Ruben, thanks for your review but few items you state are not correct. <br/>1. Check in it was clearly stipulated that you need to reach out 45 mins prior to arriving at the property. This way we can make sure the host is at the property waiting for you as you can imagine some guests are delayed etc.... Unfortunately this was not done and we prioritized your check in accordingly. Further there are cafe/bars in the area so you did not need to wait in the rain as advised. <br/>2. Do you have pictures about the inconsistencies you mentioned as we did not hear this during your stay and only received positive feedback from you. <br/>3. Regarding the blinds we also did not receive any feedback we always check prior to check in but could be that you did not know how to operate the blinds. <br/>4. No complaints heard about lights during your stay and in our eyes everything is working accordingly. <br/>5. The linen is Hotel grade quality<br/>If you could please share some pictures as we would like to review further with the evidence and would highly advise that you raise these topics during the stay so I as a host can support and address accordingly if there are really any inconsistencies. <br/>We look forward to your feedback Hi Lana, <br/>Thanks for your review, we hope to host you again in the future. <br/>All the best Hi Georgi, <br/>Thanks for your review we were happy to host you. <br/>Hope to host you again in the future. Hi Sebastian,<br/><br/>Thanks for your review, we have reviewed internally with the cleaning company and do not see what you have mentioned. The mouse traps yes hidden in very closed off areas the bed must have been moved for the poison to fall out of the traps which do indeed look like mouse excrement but is definitely not. Either way thanks for leaving your comment we have informed the team to add special holder so when the traps are in place they do not move around. Hi Leslie, <br/><br/>We hope yo host you sometime again in the future was great to host you. Hi Volker, <br/><br/>Thanks for your message, sorry to hear the sytle we have introduced within our property is not in line with your taste. We have received your feedback and will review this within the team. We hope you enjoyed your stay. Jari, was at first impression a wonderful guest to have. During the trip no complaints were informed towards our property manager and only after check in we received such comments. There were blinds but they did not see them since the ceilings are quiet high, they only needed to pull them down. Further there was no communication from Jari which is why we find it odd that ""werid communication""is mentioned. Would highly advise to do a thorough walk through with the guests if you were to host them. The bed situation is correct due to the covid situation we have changed the bedding situation around, guest still persisted to want to have 4  beds in a room rather than 3  there is a wonderful 2 person futon present but neglected to use. On request we arranged this within 30 mins of his check in and placed the 4th bed in the room where there were originally 3. Wishing you all the best. Hi Diomira,<br/><br/>Happy to hear you found the location great and quiet :) The deep cleaning has been definitely picked up! Hi Jia-Ling, thank you for taking the time to write a review! It was a pleasure hosting you Hi Brian! Your words are music to my ears. I am really excited to hear you enjoyed yourself Hi Ozan, Hope you have enjoyed your time in Amsterdam.

Hi Jennifer, thank you for taking the time to write a review. Hope you have enjoyed your time in Amsterdam! Hi Robin, thank you for taking the time to write a review! I am sorry to hear that the stay did not meet your expectations. I would definitely take your points of improvements by heart and check what went wrong in the communication. Hope you have enjoyed your time in Amsterdam after all. Kind regards, Hi Charlie, thank you for taking the time to write a review!

It was my pleasure having you! Hope to host you again in the future! Dear Isabelle, thank you so much for taking the time to write the review! Also thanks for your comment about the luggage - if we would have the chance to host you again we could also try to see if we could provide you with a late check-out. The costs are still in place, but this might have been of better convenience for you? Looking forward to host you again in the future! Dear, thank you for your review!

I regret to hear that you had issues with the hot water and heating upon arrival. I am sure that the management company I am working with was more than willing to help you, however, in these situations it is always better to call immediately since it is not guaranteed that messages will be read in such a short notice. Once I I have instructed a maintenance employee to drop by as soon as possible to help you with the warm water. We have resolved the issue, but it seems to be a re-occurring problem. After that, the maintenance employee had to be sent again to help you and that is why it took longer to fix than expected. I am sorry that you had to experience this issue, however I am sure you understand that mistakes happen and it was absolutely not my intention to cause you any inconvenience during your stay.<br/>Best Hi Clare,<br/>Thank you for taking time writing me a review! I am very sorry that you had to wait for the host to check you in. I hope the drinks that were offered to you compensated you a little for the waiting time! Sadly, you mentioned that there is no hot water in the shower. Of course, it was never my intention to cause you any trouble. And I'm really sorry that you've had to deal with this. My cleaner did say that the hot water was working before you arrived and during your stay the boiler turned off and had to be reset. I regret I did not get this issue solved any sooner. However, I am glad you had been refunded for the inconvenience! Other than that, it is nice to hear that you liked the apartment and the cleaning was up to the standard!<br/>Best Thanks Charlotte! Let me know when you're back in town! Happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay Laura, you're always welcome! Thank you Edith! Glad to hear about your experience. And yes, as you requested the late check out last minute there was some mix up with the housekeeping, but glad that everything got sorted soon and that you had such a pleasant stay! Please do come again next time :) Thanks Sunny! The apartment is indeed in an older building but we keep it clean and tidy! The front side of the building can be a bit more noisy during the day as it is on the streetside, however the bedrooms are nicely situated at the backside ;) No problem! Was great to host you! Why not Andrei? You never mentioned anything.. Please help me improve! Thank you so much Mark, great to hear you liked it so much! Always responding as quickly as possible ;)  Thanks Callan! Great that you liked it so much ;) Great to hear Melanie! Thank you so much Drew! Always want to check upon my guests ;) If you are planning on coming back again, just message me! Thanks Jake! Great to hear Harrison! Thanks Aihua!  I am glad to hear you had an lovely time! Thank you for waiting, you guys were great and hope to see you again! Hi Denis, I'm sorry to hear this. Because it's a big apartment it takes a while to clean it properly. I'm sorry that you were disappointed by the apartment. I think my pictures are very clear, the description is as well and the location is perfect. I apologize that you didn't feel this way. I hope to host you again in the future after all. Best, Lin I'm glad the creditcard was found! You're very welcome :-) Best, Lin Hi Alejandro, <br/>Thanks for the review we enjoyed hosting you very much.  The number provided to reach out towards can also be reach on whatsapp so no worries for the future or other guests. Hi Christina, thanks for your message we hope to host you again in the future. Hi Demi, <br/>Thanks for the review we highly appreciate it and look forward to hosting you again in the future. Hi John, <br/>Thanks for your response and review especially about the stairs it is indeed the standard architectural layout of the buildings in Amsterdam. Please let us know if you come back to Amsterdam we can provide you a reduced rate. All the best Hi Anthony, <br/>Thanks for your review we were happy to host you. <br/>Hope to host you again in the future. Hi Marie, <br/><br/>Thanks for your message and feedback, firstly we hope you enjoyed your stay in Amsterdam. <br/><br/>In regards to your above mentioned concerns you and your guests are the ones that were staying in the apartment if there was any challenges with noise that would not have to do with the layout of the apartment as we have not received this complaint before. Indeed the windows are closed off for safety precautions there is a very good ventilation system. In regards to the toilet these are standard Amsterdam sized toilets the ones in our property are actually much larger than the standard and is part of the Historic building features. <br/><br/>We hope to host you again in the future. Hi Mohammed<br/><br/>First let me tell you that we are in this business for the past 10 years and 1% of the guests that we wish to never experience you are fitting in that category.<br/><br/>We had a technician that knocked at your door by mistake and apologized for the inconvenience. The office contacted you and said sorry as well further a voucher was provided to you for the slight disturbance caused since you were very aggressive and seemed very unhappy. Our technician and colleagues confirm your aggressive attitude which made us feel very uncomfortable.<br/><br/>We understand that there was a miscommunication in planning from our end and we did our utmost to settle this.<br/><br/>You requested for a refund for the booking we declined. You did stay the whole reservation and sent us text messages that everything was arranged to quote ‚ÄúAgain it is not correct for you to do all this only to get free money. We work hard and people like you are why this business is not nice and not going good‚Äù<br/><br/>By showing this, we hope other Airbnb see what kind of games you play.<br/>Further, the TV is not crap they are smart TV for hotel purpose and quite new<br/><br/>Wishing you still all the best,<br/><br/>Kind Regards, Hi Kevin, <br/><br/>We hope yo host you sometime again in the future was great to host you. Dear Luise, thanks for leaving review. We are happy that you enjoyed your stay with us. So thanks for your kind words and we look forward to seeing you again. Martinus thank you.

Hi Dan,<br/>I'm happy to read that you had a great experience and that you enjoyed your stay at my apartment! Bnbmanager did a great job helping me host you and were always there to help you out with all your questions.

Hi √Åsr√∫n & Atli,<br/>Thank you for your review! It is a great help for me to improve in the future!<br/>I am so sorry to hear about your issues during your stay. I regret that the cleanliness of the apartment was not up to standards. I work together with a cleaning company and expect the apartment to be spotless. I regret to hear that this was not the case. Mice can appear in the city and it is not nice that you encountered one! I did send someone over when I heard what happened to catch the mouse with a trap, but he could not find it unfortunately!<br/>About the shower, my handymen came by to fix the tap to adjust the temperature better. My apologies that you experienced these things and I will make sure to check on the cleanliness more carefully in the future.<br/>Best Hi Anouk,<br/>Thank you for taking the time writing me a review! I am sorry about the broken heater - I am not sure if you contacted the property management agency about this, however, unfortunately I did not know about the issue. I would definitely have taken action if I would have known! I am sorry you did not have enough cutlery and glasses - I am actually in the process of restocking these. Although these shortcomings, I am glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay!<br/>Best Thanks Marianne! Thanks Ata, good to hear that you enjoyed your stay. Would be happy to host you if you're ever in town again! Glad to have helped you out Andrew! It was great to host you ;) The washing machine is a combination dryer, so make sure to put in on drying mode. Hope to see you again! The stairs in Amsterdam apartments are indeed steep. I also have an apartment on the first floor with just a few stairs ;) I am sorry to hear this Michael. As you can see in the listing and on the pictures, we have 6 beds, spread out over two rooms with 4 beds in one room and 2 in the other. The remaining 2 sleeping places are on the sleeping couch. Thank so much Will, always happy to help and inform you on anything you need! Thank you Omer! Glad to hear you like it!  Thanks Gerald! Thank you Christian, that makes me smile :) Great to hear Debbie! And I will check the dishes, that is indeed important ;) We could have brought more towels if you wanted. Thanks for the feedback! Thanks Cl√©mence, always happy to help! And yes sometimes it is not possible to leave luggage as other guests will check in. However you can usually leave your luggage for a couple of hours, no problem ;) No problem! Great to have you! You're welcome! You're welcome! Hi Renata,<br/><br/>I am really sorry to hear that you stay wasn‚Äôt as you aspected it to be. I spoke to my cleaner about this situation and clarified that the house should be really clean for my guests. I will make sure that this will never happen in the future. I always send a message trough Airbnb when I am out of town, just to check if my guests are doing fine.  Good to hear you've had a good stay! I'm sorry for the confusion about the other group. Hope to host you again! Best, Lin Thank you for your feedback Cloe! Will definitely work on it. <br/><br/>Best, Lin Dear Boris,<br/>Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We're sorry to hear that your stay did not meet your expectations.<br/>We would like to clarify a couple of points: the steep stairs are indeed a typical feature of many traditional buildings in Amsterdam, and we do mention this clearly in our listing so that guests can be prepared. Additionally, as this is a self-catering apartment rather than a hotel, basic items such as shampoo and body wash are not provided ‚Äî this is also noted in the description.<br/>That said, we regret that your overall experience was not a positive one. We always aim to offer a comfortable and pleasant stay, and we take all feedback seriously. Your comments regarding the furnishings and general upkeep have been noted, and we will use them to improve the experience for future guests.<br/>Thank you again for your review. We hope your next visit to Amsterdam is more enjoyable, wherever you choose to stay.<br/>Best regards,<br/>Dries Hi Thomas, <br/>Thanks for your review we were happy to host you. <br/>Hope to host you again in the future. Hi Le Moal, <br/>Sorry but not sure how to interpet your review in regards to the beds. The property is suitable for 7 guests, 5 single beds and 2 futons within the property. <br/>Hope to host you agian in the future. Hi Tal, <br/>Thanks for your review we were happy to host you. <br/>Hope to host you again in the future. Hi Will, <br/>Thanks for your review we were happy to host you. <br/>Hope to host you again in the future. Thank you, Jedediah<br/>Always Welcome! Hi Amaury, <br/><br/>Thanks for your message, just to be specific you checked in at 22:40 this is a late check in which means a late is applicable which is for the host.  There is indeed a device called Noiseaware to measure the decibel due to several complaints from neighbors. This way we can welcome our guests and also keep out neighbors happy. The Noiseaware device is set at a very reasonable level unfortunately you and your group were a bit loud and triggered the sensor to go off. We provided warnings regarding this several times but still you did not comply.<br/><br/>We wish you all the best. Super guest! He left the place clean and he is always welcome to come back. Hi Conrad, thank you for your review! I'll send someone over to check the water pressure, thank you for mentioning this! Hi Benjamin,  It was a pleasure hosting you.

Dear Lili, thank you so much for taking the time to give me your feedback. Your point about the kitchen supplies is very useful, I will look into it straight away. For even more comfort and space I can highly recommend you one of the other apartments - which is suited for over 12 people! Look forward to host you again in the future! Hi Eirill,<br/>I'm happy to read that you had a great experience and that you enjoyed your stay at my apartment!

Hi Jemma,<br/>I'm happy to read that you had a great experience and that you enjoyed your stay at my apartment! Bnbmanager did a great job helping me host you and were always there to help you out with all your questions. It would be great if you could show them your appreciation and drop them a review on their F acebook and G oogle as well. It will only take a minute and they‚Äôd love to read about your experiences! I am sad to hear that you have had such a bad experience. I have hosted many guests before and your comments feel different from usual. Of course, I always listen to feedback from my guests as this can help me to improve, but some of your points to me just don‚Äôt make sense. 1. About the prices, I have had years of experience and know that the price that I am asking is not at all unusual in the center of Amsterdam. 2. And about the price per person, You can see on the pictures on Airbnb that the beds can be put together if you want and it is also said that next to the 6 beds there is a couch bed if needed. You were only with 5, but bigger groups have experienced it as spacious. 3. I am sorry to hear that it smelled of smoke. My guests are not allowed to smoke inside the apartment, but with all the windows open you might get some smoke from outside, we cannot prohibit this. We do always let fresh air in during the cleaning and if you had wanted we could have asked other guests to please go and stand somewhere else while smoking. 4. About the person who entered the apartment, that was my handyman who was working on the stairs (point 7). I am sorry to hear that he entered without knocking and I have reminded him to always knock first. He was fixing the stairs in the hallway, which is why there was a hole. It has all been cleaned up afterwards. 5. It is in the listing advertisement that there is one bathroom, so you could have seen this before booking. Hope that you still enjoyed your stay in Amsterdam even though it can indeed rain a lot in Holland! Thanks Clayton! Thanks Claire! Also for the great tips ;)  You're welcome Kristaps! It was great to host you ;) Thanks Heather! Definitely be careful with the steep stairs, but it is also a typical Amsterdam experience :P Hope to see you again! Thanks Amanda!  Thanks Claudio. Sorry about the check out, we suddenly had other guests checking in and had to clean the apartment before they would arrive. I will only confirm that guests can check out later the day before their departure to prevent these situations from happening.  Thanks Prashant! Would love to welcome you back ;) Thanks Andrea! Great to hear you liked the place so much. Would love to welcome you back anytime ;) Thanks C√©line! Hope to have you back soon! Thanks for the reminder Mitch! The fourth floor is indeed high, but that is typical Amsterdam ;) I hope you will visit again! Hi Wonjun, thanks for your feedback. I'm sorry that the apartment wasn't what you expected. I think my pictures are very clear. About the mice, I'm afraid there is nothing I can do about it because it's a familiar problem in Amsterdam. I have left some traps in the apartment and I've hired a professional agency to exorcise them. I hope to host you again in the future after all. Best, Lin Good to hear Scott, you were definitely great guests!  Hi Nate, <br/><br/>First of all, Thank you for your feedback. I am sorry to hear about your bad experiences during your stay in my apartment.<br/><br/>I hired a professional painting company to paint the walls inside the bedroom about 4 days before your arrival. They told me that the smell would fade away within 2 or 3 days. As trusted that the smell would fade away before your arrival, I did not inform you in advance. Because of this, I found it reasonable to refund you a part of the money that you paid. <br/><br/>I hope that you understand that I only want the best for my guests and that we both have been affected negatively. When I decided to let the company paint the walls, it was my intention to give the apartment an upgrade and therefore, to make the living space look fresher and nicer for my future guests. If I knew in advance that you would experience problems, I would have asked the company to paint the walls after your arrival. <br/><br/>The mice that you saw in the building is very unpleasant. You are right about the fact that there are mice in Amsterdam. If you leave a lot of food open on the table and floors, it can attract them. Of course, this is not an excuse and I am shocked to hear about this. After your check out I arranged a professional mice repeller to treat the building. <br/><br/>Again, I am sorry for the trouble and I hope that you did enjoy the city of Amsterdam. <br/><br/>Lin"
68688117,"Dear Rosie, thank you for staying at my place and your suggestion for improvement. I will offer it to next guests. Hi Amira,<br/><br/>Thank you for your feedback. I will investigate the matter (I personally don‚Äôt have any problems using the Internet from home as long as I need, and I experience it as fast and reliable). Sorry, I missed your messages that you sent via airbnb website chat. At my work place I can check frequently only direct SMS and WatsApp messages. <br/><br/>However, travelers who visit the Netherlands and don‚Äôt want to use own phone subscription for SMS are very lucky. At least, in Amsterdam, free Wi-Fi is available for visitors literally at every caf√© or restaurant. This way, it is possible to send messages from any place in the city via WatsApp:)<br/> Hi Steve,<br/>I appreciate your feedback. Indeed it is the best for guests, who like to explore Amsterdam rather than spend time in the room. I will add it to my description. I also wish you lots of success with your business. You are very welcome to stay again when you need!<br/> Thank you very much for your feedback. A serious advice for travelers regarding softer bed: please select ‚Äúreal bed‚Äù option while making your booking."

76607139,"Dear Ecrin,<br/>Really sorry to read you did not enjoy your stay with us. Hopefully it did not deter you from enjoying Amsterdam. It is important to address your points of concern, however.<br/>For most of your comments I can refer you to the extensive welcome letter that you received upon arrival. We explained how the lights in the bedroom work (the lights are supplied with a dimmer). Indeed the hallway has an issue with one of the fixtures. An electrician needs to open up the ceiling but as it is high season there is a delay in planning the appointment. We added an extra desk light to make up for any lost light.<br/>As for the market sounds - yes our place is adjacent to the market. Not a secret - it shows up in many reviews and we also mention it. When choosing a city location, some city sounds are inevitable.<br/>Last but not least - the cleanliness. We take great pride in ensuring that our studio is as clean as can be. Unfortunately I do not recognise your comment about it being dirty and it puzzles me that you did not tell me during your stay in particular as I asked you if all was ok; I could have done something about it.<br/>For now thank you for commenting; it makes us even more alert as hosts but sometimes we must also correct some misconceptions. <br/>Wish you all the best! Je suis vraiment choqu√© par ces commentaires. Ces invit√©s n'ont pas une seule fois indiqu√© qu'ils √©taient malheureux et ils n'√©taient jamais l√† et ont r√©pondu quand j'ai frapp√© √† la porte. J'ai re√ßu leurs bagages t√¥t afin qu'ils puissent regarder tranquillement autour de la ville jusqu'√† ce que la chambre soit pr√™te. Une fois √† la porte, ils ont demand√© quelque chose en fran√ßais. Mon fils s'est ouvert - il a 16 ans et on se moque de lui parce qu'il ne comprend pas ce qu'ils disent. ce genre de personnes doit √™tre banni d‚Äôairbnb. Thank you Cori! It was lovely to host you and your family! Thank you so much! It was so lovely to host you!"

De f√∂hn ligt in de lange kast bij de reserve handdoeken. Graag tot een volgende keer!<br/>Vriendelijke groet<br/>Michel Dank Giulia, we stellen ons appartement met alle liefde open. Heel fijn dat jullie zo genoten hebben. Graag tot een volgende keer! fijne rustige gast, een aanrader fijne rustige gast, een aanrader fijne rustige gast, een aanrader heel fijn om te horen, graag tot een volgende keer! Heel fijne rustige gasten, ik raad ze iedereen aan fijne rustige gast, een aanrader fijne rustige gast, een aanrader fijne rustige gast, een aanrader fijne rustige gast, een aanrader fijne rustige gast, een aanrader Dank voor de mooie recensie. Graag tot een volgende meer! Thanks for your lovely review and for staying with us and we hope you had a good journey home! Hope to see you again! fijne rustige gast, een aanrader fijne rustige gast, een aanrader Dank je wel Luisa voordeze fijne reactie. In Amsterdam hebben de meeste oude huizen, dit is een huis uit 1906, zo'n stijle trap. Het staat in de advertentie vermeld. Maar fijn dat je zo'n mooie tijd in Amsterdam had en graag tot de volgende keer. Dank Clarice voor jouw reactie. Ik ben net co-host geworden omdat mijn vrouw, de host is opgenomen in het ziekenhuis. Ik moet er dus nog even aan wennen aan de communicatie maar dat gaat zeker goed komen. Het bijzondere is dat van de 206 gasten er slechts een ander  een probleem had met het slot. Toen ik arriveerde draaide ik de sleutel de goede kant op en ging de deur open. Geweldig dat jullie het zo fijn vonden. De volgende keer zijn jullie weer heel hartelijk welkom! fijne rustige gast, een aanrader Ik ben erg geschrokken van jullie reactie, mijn excuses als jullie het zo vies hebben gevonden terwijl ik het allemaal daarvoor gereinigd heb. Over de koude, de verwarming is verbonden met die van ons, als wij het warm genoeg vinden gaat hij uit en kunnen gasten eventueel de aparte kachel gebruiken. Dat hebben jullie gelukkig gedaan. En over het slot, het appartement heeft geen apart slot, dat klopt, maar ik ben ook niet van plan om ooit zomaar bij jullie binnen te komen of van jullie te stelen. Ik wil wel de mogelijkheid houden om de was op te halen of het bed te verschonen en schoon te maken als gasten langer blijven. Vriendelijke groeten<br/>Nienke de Jonge Ik heb de douche gerepareerd, dank voor de mededeling. De kapstok begrijp ik niet, je kan kiezen voor de kapstok beneden of de kast, boven bij de ingang is niet mooi en erg krap. En er is goed licht in de hal, maar u heeft blijkbaar de knop niet gevonden. Ik zal die voortaan erbij vertellen. Het spijt me dat u het te duur vond"
77686619,"Gemma, you kept the reservation until very last minute, decided not to come when we could not have any new bookings given the late date and then expressed temperamental amount of rage that the rules did not fit your plans. You did not get a refund because we did not owe you any. It was your choice not to come in the very last minute. You could have indeed come and the apartment was ready for you. The measures were mild and amsterdam was full of tourists. Regardless, I would have offered you a voucher or a future discount (which I did not owe you), but your attitude was so bad that I decided against it."

79317608,"Hi Austin, thank you very much for your highly positive review! It is such a pleasure to read and it makes me very happy that you've enjoyed the place I love so much. It has been a hectic time and I am too late to give you a public review, but I want to let you know that you've been an outstanding guest. I very much appreciated that you stayed calm when you had no warm water or warm air in the middle of the winter. You've taken excellent care of my place; according to my cleaner you've left it spotless; as if you haven't been there! Thank you Austin!"

All the best, Ifigenia Dear Blythe, thank you so much for your kind words. It was a privilege to host you & you areaways welcome to our studio. Take care of yourself.

All the best, Ifigenia Dear Jennie, than you for your kind words. It was a pleasure hosting you & your husband. Dear Michelle, thank you for your kind words. It was a pleasure hosting you & we hope to see you again in the near future. Dear Maike, thank you for your review. Please note that at our Airbnb listing the size of our studio is clearly given (30,58m2) & for the historic centrum of Amsterdam this is considered a normal+size ‚Ä¶that in comparison with the hotel rooms available in this area. Dear Jacci, thank you for the great report & fead back. I do hope to host your & your friends again soon. Kind regards, Ifigenia Dear Eduardo, thank you the review but as I explained to you when you arrived they were upgrading the internet network in our area‚Ä¶a problem that was solved within 1/2 an hour & if I remember correct both your room companions had internet connection when I was helping you to fine tune your mobile device. Take care, ifigenia Dear Amanda, thank you for the 5 star recensie. I 'd love to host you guys again so if you decide to visit Amsterdam please let me know. I od not have the studio always open but if you save it in your studio in your favourites & send me a request I 'll open it for you. All the best & keep creating beautiful work. Dear Tracey, thank you for your kind words. It was inspiring to have you & your friend around & you are always welcome here. Take care & enjoy life. Dear Jean, it was a pleasure to host you & your family. You are always welcome here. I am proud to say that I just received the super host budge once again which proves my point that as a guest Ammeta‚Äôs group is VERY DIFFICULT TO PLEASE! <br/>Ammeta said that she ‚Äòmisread the information provided‚Äù but in her case that is an understatement as pictures, size of the room & the beds is in great details provided. The strict cancelation policy is also clearly stated in various parts from the listing!  As for the benefits Airbnb has over hotels Ammeta fails to mention that there is no hotel that will except an unpaid 3rd guest & a full fee per person charge will be add on the spot (we charge an additional fee that covers the making of the sofa bed & the extra laundry service). She mentioned in her review that ‚Äòit is her personal opinion‚Äô & she entitled to it but I was not surprise to hear that our accommodation is not what she would go for as she made it clear to me in several occasions & from the beginning but how that can be our fault is a mystery as she is the one that choose it?!!!  <br/>I spend an amazing amount of time before & during her short stay (2 night & 3 days) answering to all her requests & providing informations for all sort of questions. I did my best to ensure an as smooth as possible arrival & stay. I even assist her to change the booking from 1 person to 2 to begin with & despite the fact that they arrive with their son I stayed flexible & trusting that should her son choose to stay with us, she will honour the due payment for the additional person while he was already in our studio. <br/>Upon arrival it took me more than an hour to help her locate the best way to  travel to her son‚Äôs tournament location (which was to her surprise way too far from our house!! <br/>I find it sad that despite all the help she received for the planning of her trip prior & during her stay here, she choose to contact airbnb before us for a refund! After she heard that airbnb did not grand her request for refund her attitude changed towards me & she continue finding reason to complaining about, requesting amenities which are not included in our listing & putting pressure for at least a partial refund. Their behaviour was so erratic that & I did not know anymore what to make of it! After a 2 nights stay, I received within an hour two conflicting messages: a message that she will stay with her husband after all & after an hour that her son (despite his severe allergy reactions) will stay too & she was willing to pay the extra fee!!!  <br/>I contact again the resolution centre to make the necessary changes to 3 adults but as it was late‚Ä¶unfortunately our case manager - that he was kind to help us since the start of his sift at 8:30am went home (to get a well deserved rest if you asked me) I was left exhausted & with a new case manager that in his attempted to help when he took over made the unfortunate mistake to communicate to Ammeta our private conversation in which I relate to him that my husband was unhappy with their behaviour & he would not mind seeing them gone as they took all of my time & energy & where creating a very stressful situation for our household.<br/>At the end of their 1st day & according to our 1st airbnb case manager the guests where inform to the fact that they were not entitle to any refund & should they choose to leave, we were given the option to evict them (an option we did not choose to take). Airbnb offer to re-open the days for us as the house rules were broken (an offer which also did not took upon in order to allow our guests the option to return to us should the change their mind). When I came to see them in the 2nd morning in order to find out what they want to do regarding the number of quests their attitude towards me was extremely rude & I go the impression that Ammeta‚Äôs idea of compromise was ‚Äòmy way or no way‚Äô!!! As they were already pack to go !!! <br/><br/>Please note: We NEVER authorised airbnb to evict our guests or ask them ourselves to leave & the studio remained available to them for the whole duration of their stay. <br/>Their unwillingness to communicate & to except the decision & advice of the resolution centre led in my mind to an escalation of no comparison.  As for their son‚Äôs allergy, what can I say, as a family of fellow allergy sufferers I fully understand the problem & when I heard about went to see how I can help( but obviously that was intrusive!). I feel for him but as the pollen was high at the time of their arrival & an allergy reaction can have an onset that appears later on, finding the reason can be tricky & airbnb also said so. More to the point due to our various allergies we make sure that our guest suite is clean & as far as we can tell allergen free. We have dust proof mite bed covers & no carpeted floors.  <br/>Please note that as airbnb pointed out: a. there was no proof that your son‚Äôs allergy was triggered by the room, b. he was not part of the initial booking & he stayed with us in kind & free of charge, c. we use white bed cover so that our guest find them spotless d. we never had complains for the hot water supply or the curtains & we welcome in our studio lots of guests.   <br/>I stayed open to communication to the bitter end, I state the facts to the resolution centre & I was waiting for their advice as I found the situation unbearable too. We aim to help & be there for our guests but it is difficult to have someone in our home treating us like we are second class citizens & unworthy to talk too specially when we already bent the rules & made everything possible to accommodate them.<br/>This was a first for us & we do hope the this is the last time we have to deal with such an ordeal. <br/>I am glad Ammeta found a more suitable accommodation for her & her family but as airbnb recommended,  she should always read more carefulyl the guide lines because there are there to prevent & spare both of us of situations like this. <br/><br/>All the best. <br/>Ifigenia Dear Robert, thank you for your kind words. <br/>You are a star guest & you make the airbnb hosting experience worth while fo us :) Enjoy life & stay the way you are. Dear Breanna, <br/>I am glad you enjoyed your stay with us but I would not call a hiccup the fact that you booked the wrong days for your stay with us! Admitting that indeed we made everything possible to accomodate you & fix your mistake leaves me surprise that you did not ask for extra towels or our full length mirror! We offer standard 2 different size towels which is more that other airbnb's offer & I always say to my guests... if you need something you can always ask...so I honestly do not know why you did not do it! <br/>So, I hope that you will be more careful next time while you book your airbnb dates as this can through a families schedule down the drain:) <br/>Have fun & be more considerate. Dear Janice, thank you for your kind words. It was a pleasure hosting you & your friend & as I said you are always welcome back to our studio. All you have to do is send us a message, so I can open the days for you. I do that a month in advance, so they appeared closed but it is not always the case. <br/>All the best from us & our warmest wishes for merry x-mas & have a happy new year! Thank you for your kind words. You are always welcome with us. Dear Carl thank you for your kind words. It was a pleasure hosting you. To all future hosts from a fellow super host:                                                                                       I am not at all surprised from Claudia's review, as unfair as it can be.                                  To shed light on the mater & avoid a hearsay situation, I hereby submit Claudia's  private message to us! :""No words, you ask me ......‚Ç¨ cuz I didn‚Äôt clean before go and just cuz of WEED. We are in amsterdam ifigenia. Its legal!'                                                   What can I say to a person that admits of using drugs in our house when it is overall clearly stated that we have a NO DRUGS, NO SMOKING policy & doing so can result to eviction & loss of the deposit!  My next guests provide us with a statement that our studio, 4 days after Claudia's departure, was having a residual weed/smoke smell.  As one can not photograph odors as proof of misbehaviour, that provide us with an adequate proof for an airbnb case. We had to work hard to get ride & steam clean the studio in order to ret rid the smell!                                                                                                                      What can I say to a person that comes to give us a lesson in tolerance & law obedience!    Yes, I am informed that weed is legal in Amsterdam, as it is prostitution but there are regulation which apply to it.   It is legal in Amsterdam indeed but it is a violation of human rights to enter someones  home & introduce harmful substances to their private property.  We have an allergy/smoke free listing  in order to create a save heaven for our family  & our guests & we expect this to be respected!  On top of that & for Claudia's & all involved information, there is a law which forbids to bring, sell or use drugs near a school/playground & areas where kids are near by ( a distance of 250m must be kept at all times ) .  That means, that Claudia was breaking all the above mention rules as: 1st. we have a minor in the house & 2nd. she was in a private property & not inside a coffee shop! <br/>Claudia should consider herself lucky that we do not press charges against her! Should Claudia revisit Amsterdam, I strongly advise her to book one of the many accommodation that welcomes this life style.                                                                             As of her review which google translates loosely into: ' Huge host, talk too much, intrusive'. I am not sure if huge host refers to my size? or to my behaviour?  it can be viewed as discriminative & subjective... As for the second point, I am not so sure that anyone can consider talking too much the process of welcoming someone in their  house, let them know how things work, point out where they can find the wifi password, the emergency numbers, how to use the set of keys & make sure that all is according to their wishes in order to ensure that their stay is a pleasant & safe one... As for the accusation of being ' intrusive' what can I say: I always go to help with the suitcase when guests depart, as Amsterdam staircases can be tricky for some people! We ask to strip the beds & leave the room reasonably tidy behind ( unless otherwise agreed) & I offer our guest  poffertjes ( small pancakes or a farewell gift! ) In Claudia's case, I knock the door at 10:00am to see if we can clean the room, thinking that might had gone as they did not reply my message for the gift left outside the door.  They were far from ready to go, she asked again to leave her suitcases in our place despite the fact that I said earlier that this is not possible due to a family emergency & she had to honour the check out time. I had to leave & given them the time to pack, have a shower & I left the task of escorting them out of our house to my husband. More than an hour & a half later where asking my man if they can leave their bags & come back later?!!!!.<br/><br/>So,  just in case you future hosts will like to take Claudia's  booking on, here is out the airbnb site an explanation of  what we had & you might have to go through when a guest violates your NON SMOKING / DRUGS HOME POLICY:  <br/><br/>Need an air-purifier & face Potential smoke damage.<br/><br/>When Airbnb hosts open their home to guests who smoke, they are also opening their home to potential damage.<br/><br/>Smoking, whether tobacco or pot, can lead to smoke damage including odor, soot, or in extreme cases, fire.<br/><br/>At the very least hosts should be aware that a lingering smell may remain in their home especially on blankets, cushions, clothing, and other fabrics. Covering the smell may be as simple as throwing these items in the washer, or it may require more extensive clean up depending on the magnitude of smoking that occurs in the home.<br/><br/>Get extra blankets, towels, and other fabric items to rotate and help cut down on residual smell. You can also invest in an air purifying ionizer, but make sure to follow all safety precautions that come with the ionizer unit.<br/><br/>Please note that since 2016 in Holland there is a sticky city rule banning coffee shops from being within 250 metres of a school.<br/><br/>I hope that clarifies the situation & helps future hosts to decide wisely.  <br/>Thanks for reading this to the end & good luck. Dear Emily, <br/>thank you for your kind words. You are always welcome in our Studio. Dear Yvette, thank you for your kind words. It was a pleasure meeting you & you are always welcome to our Studio. Dear Sunni, <br/>thank you for your lovely review. <br/>We really enjoyed having you & your partner around & we are looking forward to welcome you back here, even when you are loaded with heavy suitcases & travelling with family with is less mobile. <br/>As we leave in the Unesco's world heritage area stairs are unavoidable but as it is we have one of the wide ones!!! & we have a stair lift which we use for bringing up heavy suitcases & the less mobile guests & family... not to mention that kids love it as it a fun ride up & down. :) Dear Finbaar & Edna, <br/>Thank you for your kind words. You are always welcome to our Studio. Dear Alec, <br/>I was please to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us. I would like to thank you for your kind words & to let you know that you are always welcome back to our Studio. Dear Nicole, Thank you for your kind words. I wish all our guest could be like you. I was really sad to see you going. All the best & I do hope to host you again soon. Ka Hang & his friend were the ideal guests, very graceful, friendly. Communication before and during their stay went super smoothly! They left the place in great condition & were very respectful of our home and property. Thank you for being such awesome guests. We do hope that you can visit us again sometime! We recommend them to all future host! Dear Antoine, <br/>I have to say that I was surprise & to receive such a review! <br/>Our studio, as you know, is located at the historic center of Amsterdam, 15min max. walk from all major attraction. Our price varies per season & it was one of the lowest in the area for the Easter weekend, not to mention a weekend that went down in the history of the city as one of the most busy ones due to all the music events. <br/>I understand that the DGTL location is not exactly next door to us but the tram/ferry connection is superb & I would expected for one attending the festival for the last 4 years that you knew about it! As for the size of the room, the dimensions are clearly posted in our site. <br/>I really do my best to inform my guests about our accommodation, in order to save disappointment for both parties but at the end of the day one should read through all the info... <br/>All the best, Ifigenia Thank you for your kind words. It was a pleasure hosting you guys & I would love to see you again. All the best.<br/>Ifigenia Thank you guys for your kind words. I am pleased that you enjoyed your stay with us.

I would like to thank you for the chocolates & all the other presents. It was a welcoming surprise for us.  I am glad you found your stay with us GREAT. We do always our best to help & be there for our quest. One only has to ask:) Thank you too for being such good guests. It was a first one for us with 4 people in the studio but we were glad to help you accommodate your friend. You are always welcome here.  Thank you Yangkai.

I so please to hear you enjoyed the stay with us.<br/> Dear Dino, <br/>I am glad you all had great time in Our Studio but ....<br/>Cats on attack!!! :) ...how is that possible?! :)<br/>We leave here for many years & we never had a cat attacking us  ;)<br/>Amsterdam is a city of animal lovers & all one has to do is indeed to keep the window close when out of the room. <br/><br/><br/> Thank you Andrea,<br/>You & your family are always welcome here. Dear Jose, <br/>Thank you & you should now that it was a pleasure to help you discover Amsterdam. <br/>You & your friends are always welcome to our Studio.<br/>Gr. Ifigenia<br/><br/> Dear Eliana, <br/>Thank you for your kind words, <br/>It was a real pleasure to have you & your kids in our Studio & we look forward seeing you again. <br/>Gr. Ifigenia <br/>"

82812635,"Thank you for your wonderful review. very much appreciated.<br/>All the best!

"
83063481,I took your advice and mentioned our sweet cat in my description. Now you can see in 3 places in my advertisement that we have a cat. <br/>We have been living here very happily for 15 years and raised our 3 children with the same stair gate and the same stairs that has always gone well and without any problems. <br/>What a shame that you had this experience in our lovely home.

Big hugs from us both Hi Karolina, thanks for your great review. Highly appreciated! Warm regards from Amsterdam Thank again Lucie for your second review üôèüèº Hi guys, thanks for the great review. Merci ! For your great review , it was a pleasure to have you both in our house Thank you Celina for your great review and nice to hear that you had a great time in our home and Amsterdam.<br/>üëã Hi guys, thanks for the great review and if we have the change to visit France we definitely consider your place üôèüèº Good to hear that you both had a beautiful stay and thanks for the great review üôèüèº Thank you for your review, and it's a shame that you were both dissatisfied with your stay in our boutique room.<br/>Just a comment from me to put everything in a better perspective, the room has 2 beds that together form a queen-size bed, the dimensions are 160 x 200 cm, this is also stated in our advertisement. You are talking about a homestay but we offer a Bed & Breakfast. If you spend the night in a homestay, this means that you sleep in people's homes. Often in a separate room. A homestay is often a cheap way to spend the night. You usually sleep, relax and eat with the family. So breakfast is what we offer, because we are a bed & breakfast, remember! <br/>Before you arrived with us, I asked you whether we had to take food allergies or something special into account with breakfast, as we ask to all our guests. <br/>But your answer was that you arranged your breakfast yourself. If you wanted to use our kitchen you could have communicated this with us, but you said you arranged it yourself. <br/>Then I don't think it's fair of you to say that you couldn't use the kitchen. <br/>IT‚ÄôS ALL ABOUT COMMUNICATION. <br/>So for your next visit to Amsterdam, I strongly advice you to  look for an accommodation with a kitchen,  so that you can prepare your meals for yourself. <br/>About the lock on your door, you are the first guest that makes an issue of that in 6 years that we are doing this, but think about this ! we offering the keys of our entire house, so there‚Äôs also a lack of trust from your side. So another reason to choose an other stay option for next time. Thank you Cynn for your great review.<br/>Hope to meet again one day <br/>All the best‚ù§Ô∏è Wow Maria & Violeta, thank you for your hart warming review. You gave us tears in our eyes.<br/>You‚Äôre both also in our hearts forever.<br/>Big hug from us both, Ton & Will Wow what a review Emile & Manu.<br/>Thank you sooo much. ü´∂ Guten abend Carolin, wow !

Patrick!!<br/>Thanks for the fantastic review. <br/>You make us blush ;-) <br/>Many thanks, Ton & Will Hi Arielle, first of all thanks for your nice review.<br/>I want to make an correction on that, from our home you don't need to take the train for restaurants/cafes.<br/>There are several restaurants 5 minutes walk from us on the Johan Huizingalaan and even a nice Amsterdam cafe in our street, but if you looking for some trendy restaurants/cafes you have to take the tram into the city or to the Hoofddorpplein area and that will take you for the last option, van Mechelen on the Sloterkade for example, from door to door 13 minutes, that's reasonable I think."

I couldn't agree more with the way you described the Haarlemmerbuurt! Very close to all the action, but a bit more quiet than areas such as the Red Light District. Loved hosting you!

Great to hear you enjoyed your stay. Maybe 'til next time! Hi Rastin, good to hear you liked the place. Thank you for leaving the place so clean and tidy. You're welcome to stay here again any time. Thanks for this great review Melvin!<br/>Kind regards and all the best! Hi Naji, thank you for your message! You have filled in our arrival form, stated that you were coming at 5PM, so we have scheduled the cleaning before 5PM. Since you have checked in earlier them 5PM, the apartment was not cleaned yet. We have done our best to clean the apartment as soon as possible. We wanted to refund you the cleaning fee but you had decided to leave already. I don't think it's fair to call us untrustworthy now, since we have did everything we could to clean the apartment as soon as possible. At the end, the full stay had been refuned to you. Thanks for the time you took to write me a review Adrian, your feedback is very helpful to me. I'm so sorry to hear that you were influenced by the technical issue that we had that day, I understand that must have been very inconvenient. Especially assuming you're travelling with luggage! I know that its not of any help for you, but I do want to let you know that this issue has been addressed and solved in the mean time. Being available for contact over the phone is very important part of our service, and we are very very sorry that this was down when you arrived. Other than the feedback on the room is very valuable because it can really help me improve it for future guests. Please note that you were here during a heatwave, so every room in the country must have felt a bit stuffy around that time. Of course we could make it more comfortable for you by for example offering a fan. I'm glad that despite it all you did like the bed :)  Let me know when you feel like coming again! It is indeed great when you plan to go into the city most of the time ;) You're welcome Twan! Anytime! Great to hear you had such a nice experience ;) Thanks so much for your lovely feedback, I am glad to hear that you liked the apartment. Let me know if you are in Amsterdam once again. "
83901788,"We are pleased to host Mathilde and her group. Unfortunately she has not contacted us about the light, not even when i met them the next day. There is suffucient light in the living room. The light turn is nearby the living room door. I really hope she found it and just find that the light is not sufficient. I cannot inmagine she stayed 2 days without turning the lights on. Sad to read above review, the more because we do not recognize the critics. First two towels each persons has been given and we prepared 5 beds because your reservation is made for 5 persons. You cannot expect we prepare more beds than you make the reservation for. If you want to change beds or rooms, you can take off the bedsheets from the original bed and place to the bed you want by yourself. <br/>If the loft is not clean or you want more towels than is given, guests may always warn/ask us. But Mike and his group did not complain about anything during their whole stay which make for everyone difficult to know what is missing and give us no chance to explain. Unfortunately the day Jorgen's group arrive we had the worst weather in last few months. It was very stormy and it rained very hard. Therefore there was not much to do in the neighbourhood. Otherwise we think our neighbourhood is really not that bad. We have restaurants, shopping area and public transport all with 10 minuts walk. See all our other reviews from other guests we host before.<br/>We advise to future guests to look at Google Maps to see what is available in our neighbourhood. If the location do not suit your group, it is wise to look for an other location which meet your wishes. Dear Carolin, thank you for your stay and sorry for the inconvenience about the bathroom. When we were preparing for you arrival, there was no strange smell in the bathroom on first floor. After you informed us the second day we directly clean the bathroom once more. You told me that it was a lot better and when we did the checkout check today, we noticed no strange smell. We hope it is just an incident. <br/>Chi Just to avoid misunderstanding for other guests, we want to explain things clearly. <br/>You can take a bus or a metro to Amsterdam Central Station in just 10 minuts ride. You even can walk within 20 minuts to the 24 hours free ferry which bring you directly to Amsterdam Central Station.<br/>You do not need to take a train and a bus to go to my loft from Amsterdam Central Station. You only need a train to come from the airport to Amsterdam Central Station, what is very normal.<br/>Furthermore, for every guest 1 clean bedsheet, duvet and towel are included. If you stay more days, we also prepare more towels. If guests want extra bedsheets or towels besides what is already given, we need to charge for it. Hi Majo, thank you for your stay. I read that the heating was not working? I just checked it, and it worked. Could it be that you did nog turn the thermosstat on? From my NEST account, I see that the heating has not been turned on during your stay. But still good to hear that your group had a nice stay further."
84256372,"Helaas kreeg ik een waardering van 3 sterren en dit strookt niet met wat je over je verblijf bij mij hebt geschreven. Verwarrend. You gave me 4 stars for neatness and accuracy. Could you explain that? Was the room not clean? Mij  rekeningnummer is NL 29 INGB 4759191 t.n.v. C.J. Jongsma Hi Nikita, You may not have to 'expect extensive conversations' with me (there is such a thing as action - reaction) but I always offer to have an answer to any question. Too bad you didn't read my information that there is a night bus from the center that takes you to my neighborhood. I hope you had a nice walk and I'm glad the weather was nice. Thank you for the tip. I still have my grandmother's sheets (more 80 years old I think, as well as the pillow case). :) Hi Stefania,<br/>You were a nice guest. I hope all is well with you. Merry Christmas and a good 2022!<br/>Greetings,<br/>Carla Two questions:<br/>I can not walk:<br/>- how could I have been in your room without permission if I can not walk<br/>- and I have not been in the fridge and do not eat meat. How can I have your meat removed from the fridge? One of the annoying things about airbnb is that every criticism of the guest translates into a negative score:<br/>unsolicited take a new blanket from the plastic from a private part of the closet, say that you tried to wake the host because it was cold. While you made so much noise after 10 pm, that not only the host but also the whole building was awakened.<br/>Say that you did not touch the blanket, while in the morning the blanket lay wrinkled on your bed. Dry cleaning costs of ‚Ç¨ 35.<br/>At 11.00 pm heavy suitcases with a lot of noise lifting down and damage my stucco wall that I unfortunately only saw when you were gone.<br/>In the morning at 6 o'clock in the street, calling - the woman has a loud voice - so that not only me but also the neighbors woke up.<br/>It is the first time I have received guests with a total lack of awareness of their surroundings. Incomprehensible, this criticism. It is also the first time that I respond to this publicly. Every guest I ask to read my site carefully and confirm that they agree with this if they want to book. So you knew that my house rules are: no noise and showers after 10 pm.<br/>You had e-mailed that you would arrive about 1 pm. So I waited for you in vain.<br/>Enjoy because your wife did not speak English? What are you talking about? May I point out that the risk of assumptions is that you are behaving accordingly?"

89290598,"Deze gasten hebben na hun vertrek een klacht en restitutie gevraagd aan Airbnb omdat wij geen ontbijt serveerden . Helaas hadden deze gasten de advertentie tekst van onze listing  beter moeten lezen daarin staat nl . duidelijk dat we geen ontbijt serveren maar wel koffie en thee. <br/>Wij vinden deze klacht daarom ook onterecht . We hebben dit ook netjes uitgelegd aan ze . Na dit bericht hadden gasten opeens ook nog andere klachten nl. dat wij zouden discrimineren en onvriendelijk waren . Dat was een schok voor ons om hiervan beschuldigd te worden. <br/>Ik zou zeggen lees onze reviews , we zijn inmiddels 9 jaar superhost deze status bereik je alleen door hele goede reviews. De klachten zijn geheel onterecht ! Thank you for your review, we checked the smell in the hallway and did not notice it. We asked the next visitors and they could not smell anything. Dank je voor je recensie . We doen meestal een handdoeken wissel na 4 dagen . En over het slot op de deur , aan de andere kant van de deur wonen en geen andere huurders. Maar goed dat je het hebt benoemd dan kunnen we het beter uitleggen aan gasten We are sorry a microwave is not allowed by the municipality, you may not cook! Thank you Molleda, and you are right about the kettle, we will change the kettle. Steep stairs are mentioned  in our description. The heating is controlled by a thermostate, like I explained to you! You could have controlled the temeperature yourself. Thank you for your nice words!! Hi austin <br/>Thank you for being our guests and for the very nice review! You are welcome back any time! The staircase is typically for Amsterdam apartments and not very steep. Large and heavy suitcases can be a bit of a problem moving up.<br/>A microwave is not mentioned in our advertisement, and a broom is also not mentioned in our advertisement.<br/>We never had any complaints of our arrival description, most of our guests are very happy with the description we share with them before they come to our apartment."

We are glad you enjoyed your stay with us and it was a pleasure to host you Thank you for the nice review, but you decided only to give us 4 stars. I know that this was your first time ever using Airbnb, so perhaps your expectations are very high!<br/>After all, you were able to check in 5 hours early<br/>You were able to park your car for FREE at the closest possible place to the centre of Amsterdam (where it costs 60 euro PER DAY to park)<br/>You had a room with a luxury private bathroom and you found it a bit warm on the first night, while it was freezing outside.<br/>You had fresh towels and your bed was made and the room cleaned each day<br/>You had a full breakfast each morning with freshly baked bread and all you could eat<br/>You were given a complimentary bottle of wine to enjoy<br/>All for a price lower than a bunk bed in a hostel without breakfast!!!<br/>I hope your next experience with airbnb will be better!<br/> Thank you for your kind review, and we will look forward to seeing you again in the future!

Thank you Emilio and Paulette!  Tot ziens allebei! Thank you Sophie for your kind words. Always a pleasure to hear all is appreciated. Yes, this is a room which is very private almost like a studio.  I love to spoil a bit my guests. It is not expected from an airbnb let. <br/>I am very glad you like all the little things.<br/>Yes, sometimes when it is possible (when I have the same day or the day after) I ask if you like to stay a bit longer. So much nicer to leave all in the room, maybe just take an extra shower and than take your flight back home.<br/>Sorry Conleth (I mispelled your name in my review)!<br/>And please do come back here!<br/>Tot ziens!<br/>Groetjes,<br/>Ingrid Thank you for your feedback Ilse!<br/>But it is a big surprise to hear the feedback about the shower temperature and floorheating.<br/>First the showerwater can get really hot! For safety reason there is a regulator, a button you can press when you want de water really hot. So you‚Äôre remark is not correct. More likely is that you did not know how to make the water hotter. One message to me and I would have explained it to you.  <br/>Secondly the floorheating is always on, was on during your stay and kept the room warm.  In the shower there is also floorheating on the dry area, not under the wet area of the shower. <br/>In the bathroom there is a towel rack radiator which you can regulate from 1 till 5. It worked during your stay. <br/>If a problem occurs during your stay you should ask for help.  At least that is what I would do. I was always available and reachable to solve eventual problems .  But you did not ask for help or text me.<br/>And I think it is unfair to complain after you are  gone without telling me in person, we saw each other even when you left.  You said nothing about a cold shower. <br/>I do realise that being from Australia Holland felt very cold during your stay.  My guests from South-America after your stay had no such issues with the room temperature and shower. And I never ever have had such complaints. If so we would immediately do something about it.  <br/>Being cold or warm it is a subjective matter. But if serious enough for you, you should always tell and ask so we can do something about it. And so we can see if it has to be changed to make you more comfortable or to make your showering much warmer by just one simple quick technical explanation such as a regulation button. <br/>However feedback is always good. We will tell more explicitly how you can get a hotter shower and underline again during check in that if something occurs just ask during your stay so we can look at it together!!! Thank you very much Vladimir! I love to suprise (and spoil a bit) my guests.<br/>Hope to see you back! Thank you Christophe. Good to see you enjoyed the extra's. Dank je wel Corine! With love Lisa and Narelle! And yes, come back. Next time I want to know all about that fish and more about Australia! Thank you Pat and Rick for your kind words! Thank you both so much for your feedback!   With pleasure Danielle! Thank you for your Feedback! Sometimes there is a rapport! I already feel welcome in South-Korea by your welcoming words to visit South-Korea. Thank you for your kind feedback. I really enjoyed meeting you. You are Welcome anytime. Hope to see you back. And who knows, maybe for good...in Amsterdam. Your lifestyle would definitely match the life in Amsterdam! 'Dank Charlotte! Ik hoop dat jullie beiden nog een keertje terugkomen. Dear Christine,<br/>Thank you for your extensive feedback.<br/>For fresh air indeed the little window can be opened and if the bathroom door stays open this air can enter the room. Secondly, when you switch on the light of the bathroom  the ventilation will be activated in the bathroom. And after the light is off, the ventilation will stay on for a half an hour. And last but not least, in the big front windows there are ventilation grilles in each window which easily can be opened and closed by hand (with strings), especially for fresh air!  It may not have been obvious because of the long vitrage. I totally agree with you that fresh air is important. So I will tell guests about the window grille when they check in.<br/>As for the price of the room. Yes, compared with for instance Germany, rooms of this quality and with the service I give, are more expensive in Amsterdam. <br/>But there is an extended variety in the type of rooms or apartments Amsterdam offers. So the guest can chose the exact type of room which suits his or her budget and quality demands. I often have guests who cancel their horrible expensive hotelroom to opt for my room with advantages a hotelroom can never give.<br/>I am glad airbnb offers so much choice and nice places to stay where personal contact is still valued in this sometimes  too impersonal and digital world.<br/>As for the Gitter. It is open during the day and closed at night. An idea might be to keep it open during  the stay of the guest. <br/>As I am always available in person/or by whatsapp or handy, guests can always ask is something is lacking or not quite clear.<br/>Feedback is always usefull to see and experience the room through the guests perspective.Thanks again Christine! Dear Susanne and David,<br/>I hope you had a great time in Amsterdam.<br/>Thank you for staying in our room.  I am sorry I could not say goodbye due to my stay in Greece.  I had the impression your really embraced the room. I like it when people feel at home.  And because of my stay abroad I couldn't write a review. I hope this will be placed.<br/>And good to see you  also receive guests in your city which I still plan to visit.<br/>Maybe in the coming year.<br/>Thank you again for your review and also for the good suggestion you gave us.<br/>Hope to see you again!<br/>Ingrid"

I was not aware of the described issues you encountered and I appreciate you mentioning it. I immediately checked the airvent to make sure no cold air will come through anymore. I take your tips at heart about a shower curtain and the possibility to warm up your food, lighting to make sure that other guests will not experience the same. I highly appreciate your constructive feedback and you are welcome anytime to experience the difference! "

97066918,"Beste Roman,<br/>Amsterdam is nou eenmaal een erg dure stad. Dus met gratis parkeren en gratis fietsen voor 4 personen vinden wij dat een heel  redelijke prijs. Zeker voor een drukke feestdag. Bovendien zorgen wij altijd dat er koffie thee en een welkoms wijntje klaarstaat. De topmatrassen zijn vorig jaar nieuw aangeschaft maar we zullen er naar kijken.<br/>Maar fijn dat jullie genoten hebben. Vriendelijke groet Dick en Loes. Deze reactie is wel heel erg jammer. Mijn man Dick is nog komen vragen of alles naar wens was. En er werd ons verteld dat alles prima in orde was. Achteraf gaan klagen is lastig dan kunnen we er niets meer aan doen of veranderen. Dat noemen wij toetsenbord ridders. Vriendelijke groet Dick en Loes. Hallo Ronald, <br/>Ja de bank het is een bed bank. Maar we willen er best naar kijken. <br/>En de TV niemand kijkt meer TV tegenwoordig die wilden we er eigenlijk uit halen.<br/>Maar je was wel zo enthousiast dat je voor januari ook wilde boeken.<br/>Misschien vond je vriendin niet wat ze er van verwacht had?  <br/>Verder niet heel luxe maar toch wel van alle gemakken voorzien. Koffie thee wijntje!<br/>Maar fijn dat je toch een positieve ervaring had. <br/>Vriendelijke groet Dick en Loes Aaaaah wat een lief bericht. Wij vonden het ook heel leuk met jullie. En nogmaals zo leuk om marathon lopers als gasten te hebben. Heel veel succes nog hiermee . Vriendelijke groet Dick en Loes. Ellen en haar vrienden waren aardige rustige gasten. Wat wel jammer was dat er wat dingen kapot waren gegaan. Een gordijn was gescheurd douche houder afgebroken en een achterlicht van een fiets kapot. Dat kan natuurlijk altijd gebeuren maar meld dat dan even. Jullie hadden nog met mijn man Dick gesproken bij vertrek. En de volgende gasten kwamen er al vrij snel aan. Elliott en zijn vrienden waren zeer vriendelijke aardige gasten. Die ondanks het slechte weer er toch vaak op de fiets de stad gingen verkennen. Dat was erg jammer voor ze dat het zo veel regende. Ik zou ten zeerste aanbevelen Wij zijn de eigenaren Dick en Loes en vinden jou recensie echt heel erg leuk. Wij wonen al 37 jaar op deze geweldige plek en worden daar nog elke dag blij van. Daarom willen wij dat heel graag delen met onze gasten. En doen daar ook wel ons best voor. Nogmaals heel erg bedankt voor jullie super enthousiaste reactie<br/>Hopelijk tot ziens groeten Dick en Loes. Hallo Tara hierbij wil ik even reageren op jou aandachtspunten. <br/>De ventilator in het toilet hebben we uitgezet omdat hij nogal lang met wat veel lawaai aanblijft. Verder zijn de foto‚Äôs van de ruimte absoluut niet groter weergegeven.  En wij zeggen altijd heel duidelijk bij een boeking dat het toilet en douche zich in de slaapkamer bevinden. Mochten de gasten dat niet prettig vinden raden wij ze aan ergens anders te boeken. Wij willen graag dat onze gasten tevreden zijn. Maar heel fijn dat jullie toch een hele leuke tijd hebben gehad. Vriendelijke groet Dick en Loes Vreemd, toen mijn echtgenoot met jullie sprak waren jullie heel erg enthousiast. <br/>Jammer dat jullie nergens iets over gezegd hebben. Het fietsen naar de stad is ongeveer 20 minuten. En helaas is de ruimte wat het is. Wij proberen dat zo duidelijk  mogelijk op de foto‚Äôs kenbaar te maken. En misschien hebben jullie niet goed gekeken maar naast het bed in de slaapkamer staat een kledingkast. En als laatste tja Amsterdam is nou eenmaal duurder dan een dorpje en zeker in het hoogseizoen. En wij leveren er nog gratis goede fietsen bij. Toch fijn dat jullie hebben genoten . Vriendelijke groeten Dick en Loes Onze locatie is inderdaad in een prachtig landelijke omgeving en toch niet ver van de stad. Het openbaar vervoer is inderdaad wat moeilijker te bereiken. Daarom hebben wij de service van 4 prachtige gratis fietsen aangeboden. Zo jammer dat jullie daar geen gebruik van hebben gemaakt. Al is het maar om mee naar de metro te fietsen. Giuseppe en zijn vrienden waren zeer gezellige gasten om te hebben. Ze hebben dan ook van s‚Äômorgens tot s‚Äôavonds laat van Amsterdam genoten. De ruimte keurig achtergelaten. Wij zullen ze dan ook absoluut aanbevelen Wat fijn dat jullie het ondanks het slechte weer zo leuk hebben gehad. En jammer dat jullie zo vroeg weg moesten, anders hadden jullie vandaag Amsterdam met veel zon kunnen zien. Het was ook een plezier om jullie als gasten te hebben. Vriendelijke groet Dick en Loes Jullie waren ook ontzettend leuke meiden. En wat ik nog een keer wil benadrukken enorme stoere meiden. Door regen storm op de fiets van s‚Äômorgens vroeg tot s‚Äôavonds laat op de fiets . Gelukkig werd het ook nog mooi weer. Ik beveel jullie bij iedereen aan. En hopelijk nog een keer bij ons. Vriendelijke groet Dick en Loes Anna en haar familie waren vriendelijke en aardige gasten. Wij hadden leuk contact met allemaal. Wij zouden ze dan ook sterk aanbevelen. Dick en Loes Hallo C√©dric, fijn dat jullie genoten hebben van jullie verblijf op onze woonboot.<br/>Door vastgestelde overheids regels in Nederland<br/> Is het helaas niet toegestaan om een uitgebreidere keuken te hebben. Ik geef toe het is wat beperkt. Maar toch alles aanwezig om maaltijden te bereiden. Wat betreft privacy , in de advertentie staat duidelijk aangegeven dat de eigenaren boven de AirB&B wonen. Dus kunnen erover en weer wat geluiden zijn. Fijne avond Hallo Sarah, allereerst fijn dat jullie het naar de zin hebben gehad. Er staat duidelijk in de advertentie aangegeven dat wij als eigenaren boven de AirB&B wonen. Ik was in die week alleen thuis en lig altijd wel om 11 uur in bed en bovendien niet de hele dag thuis. Wat betreft de fietsen zowel het zadel en stuur zijn hoog en laag verstelbaar. Ik ben zelf 1.64 cm en fiets er prima op. Ik had van te voren ook aangegeven als er iets is dat jullie dat altijd kunnen vragen. Dan kunnen we oplossingen bedenken. Achteraf klagen heeft zo weinig nut. Fijne avond Wij geven altijd heel duidelijk aan dat de douche in de slaapkamer is en zeker aan bevriende koppels. Verder hebben Airbnb sterren een andere waarde dan hotel sterren. Daar in tegen heeft onze Airbnb weer andere charmes. Fijn dat jullie zeker genoten hebben vriendelijke groet Loes Hallo Hugo fijn dat jullie genoten hebben. Maar wel jammer dat je de klachten en wensen niet meteen tegen ons zegt. Maar pas achteraf. Dan kunnen wij er niets meer aan veranderen. Ik zeg altijd tegen alle gasten in het begin als er iets is kom dan even langs. Dan lossen wij het op .<br/> Vriendelijke groet Dick en Loes Hallo Yann<br/>Wat fijn dat jullie zo genoten hebben met de kinderen van onze plek.<br/>Later bedacht ik me nog dat ik in de schuur nog 2 kinderstoelen had staan.<br/>Helemaal vergeten die jullie aan te bieden. Mochten jullie nog een keer komen zullen we die klaarzetten.<br/>Vriendelijke groeten Loes Allereerst wil ik toch eerst even verwijzen naar onze 131 recensie ‚Äòs die meer dan lovend zijn. Eigenlijk alleen maar over hoe rustig het hier is en midden in de natuur. De meeste gasten noemden het ‚Äú het platteland in Amsterdam‚Äù<br/>Eerlijk gezegd heeft deze dame geen Airb&B nodig,maar medische hulp. <br/>En als je al gevoelig bent voor ‚Äú geluiden‚Äù zou ik persoonlijk heel goed uitzoeken waar ik terecht kwam door bvb een streetfew te bekijken.<br/>Ik was dat weekend alleen thuis. Of eigenlijk bijna niet. Omdat ik veel bij vrienden doorbracht. En om 11 uur s‚Äôavonds al in mijn bed lag. Bij aankomst heb ik ze nog een hele maaltijd pasta gegeven voor 4 personen omdat ze niets te eten hadden en de kinderen heel erg honger hadden. Wat ik al vreemd vond. Over de hygi√´ne van ons appartement wat zeker nu met covid nog extra schoon gemaakt word hebben we ook nooit klachten gehad. Ze was ook zo duidelijk aanwezig door s‚Äônachts terwijl het hier doodstil was de rivier er rimpelloos bij lag je wakker te appen met ‚Äúzoals je ziet ben ik nog steeds wakker‚Äù kortom een zeer triest geval. Heel sneu ook voor de kinderen die hier heerlijk op ons priv√© terras mochten vissen. Verder denk ik dat de uiteindelijke reden dat ze vertrokken  zijn was, dat alle grenzen in Duitsland dichtgingen en dat men op eigen kosten bij de grens in een hotel in quarantaine moest verblijven . Beste Michelle,<br/>Ik denk dat het misschien de eerste keer was dat jullie Airb&B hebben gedaan.<br/>En dat jullie hadden verwacht de zelfde service te krijgen als in een hotel.<br/>In een Airb&B huur je een ruimte bij particulieren. Natuurlijk met schoon linnen en handdoeken.<br/>Maar wij komen niet elke dag de kamers opruimen. Het is net als in een vakantie woning. Verder is er voor de start altijd ruim koffie thee etc aanwezig.<br/>Wij verwelkomen de gasten ook nog met een welkomspakket.<br/>En als er vragen zijn zullen we zo veel mogelijk tegemoet komen.<br/>Dat wou ik even uitleggen.<br/> Toch heel fijn dat jullie het zo naar jullie zin hebben gehad.<br/>Vriendelijke groeten Loes Beste Eva Maria,<br/>De ijskast kun je op verschillende standen zetten. Van 1 tot 7 . <br/> Hij stond inderdaad op 7 .  Wat meer keukendoeken had je gewoon aan ons kunnen vragen. Dan hadden we die gegeven. En de matrassen hebben we nog niet lang geleden aangeschaft. Maar toch fijn dat jullie een leuke tijd hebben gehad. <br/>Vriendelijke groeten Loes Heel fijn om te horen dat jullie het zo leuk hebben gehad. En inderdaad vooral na regen hebben we nogal last van spinnen. Het voordeel is dat ze de muggen op eten, maar begrijp dat het ook niet prettig is. Misschien goed idee om horren in de ramen te zetten. Zal zeker schelen. Helaas lopen ze ook via de deur naar binnen.<br/>We gaan er aan werken. vriendelijke groet Dick en Loes Op de foto""s staat precies aangegeven  hoe onze AirB&B eruit ziet. Dus is het ook u keuze geweest om hier te verblijven.  Jammer dat u niet tijdens u verblijf heeft laten weten dat het niet helemaal naar u verwachting was. Dan hadden we er nog iets aan kunnen doen. Achteraf kritiek geven heeft weinig zin.  Wel hebben wij al 6 maanden nieuwe spullen in de opslag staan, (wastafelmeubel linnenkasten etc) maar door de drukte van erg enthouste gasten hebben we geen tijd om deze te plaatsen. Misschien een geruststelling. Maar dan blijft de vraag wat zocht u eigenlijk? Een leuke plek om te verblijven of een gratis parkeerplaats? Wij wensen u het allerbeste Erg vriendelijke keurige gasten. Daarom verbaaste het ons zeer dat ze allemaal moddervoetafdrukken op onze sierkussens van de bank hadden achtergelaten .<br/>En de lade van de bedbank er zo scheef in hadden geschoven dat de hele rails  krom was. en dit alles zonder even te melden.  Dus maar voor de afgesproken uitcheck tijd vertrekken jammer. Hoewel het hun eigen keuze is geweest om op onze plek te verblijven, was het vanaf het eerste moment bij binnenkomst het plan om er niets maar dan ook niets van te maken.<br/>Voor hun zelf niet en zeker niet voor ons. Toen ik op ze af kwam lopen met uitgestoken hand om me voor te stellen werd ik totaal genegeerd. Mijn man die ze later kwam vragen of alles lukte met de fietsen werd de rug toegedraaid. Ons altijd  prachtige  vredige plek veranderde in een mijnenveld. Eerlijk gezegd als wij het in eigen beheer zouden hebben hadden wij ze ter plekke geld terug gegeven en direct laten vertrekken. Als laatste zijn ze 2 uur voor de afgesproken tijd vertrokken met de buitendeur open vast aan een touw. . Terwijl het hoog zomer is en er heel veel bootjes op het water zijn. Wij zijn niet eens boos maar heel erg ontdaan dat er zulke mensen rondlopen met zoveel negatieve energie.  en doelbewust je schade aan willen richten. Misschien een duidelijke tip voor andere hosts. Wij hopen ze nooit nooit meer tegen te komen"

97204642,"Hi Hamish,<br/>Thank you for your critics. I am sorry to hear that you didn't consider the room as clean as wanted, and I will have a good look at it to improve that to the future. I noticed the bugs and working hard on getting them out, so far haven't managed completely as indeed they seem the find my boat very attracting. <br/>Happy to hear you still enjoyed your stay. Thank you Darren, I am so happy you had a good stay! Thank you Michael, It was a pleasure to have you on board! Hi Katherine,<br/>Thanks for noticing the slow drainage in the shower and apologies for the inconvinience.<br/>Not that it is of any help for you anymore, but I fixed it. <br/>All the best,<br/>Rinze Hi Ed, <br/>Happy to hear you had such a good time, and of course welcome back any time! Oh dear! Oh hope that wasn't too inconvinient. He really does put a lot of effort in his cleaning (we probably pay him by the hour ;-). )  Apologie for that and thanks for telling. I will instruct him better next time! Thanks for your kind words! Always happy to hear that people enjoyed so much. <br/>Let me know if you make it to Amsterdam again, and I would be happy to show you around.<br/>Rinze Hi Jenny,<br/>Thank you! I received your message. Simon is the owner and I am the caretaker. For Airbnb it's still a bit confusing, but in the end it works.. Hi Shannon,<br/>Indeed a shame that we didn't meet, but happy to hear you had such a good time!"
100077413,"Het was inderdaad erg warm in Europa. Iets dat heel ongebruikelijk is in Nederland. Om deze reden had ik speciaal een ventilator gekocht voor op de kamer.. Toen bleek dat dit onvoldoende was heb ik jullie mijn eigen ventilator gegeven omdat deze meer kracht had. Het spijt me om achteraf te horen dat jullie op de grond zouden hebben moeten slapen. Ik had het fijn gevonden als jullie dit met mij op dat moment hadden besproken. We hadden dan samen een oplossing kunnen vinden. Julia and her friend are very nice guests. They are kind, cheerful, polite clean and respectful. It was nice to host them and I can recommend them to other hosts. Thanks for staying and you are always welcome to come back Danke Sabine<br/>Sie sind immer wilkommen. Ich freuhe mich das alles war super fur sie.

102064815,"Thank you Grant for your stay and review. Please know we are very serious about the cleanliness and maintenance of this lovely space.  I am sorry you did not like our sheepskin. It can be acquired taste I know. We have replaced it in the meantime. The curtains had picked up some colour on the bottom from the hardwood floor (we maintain it very well). We thank you for noticing this and have replaced them in the meantime. I would have appreciated hearing your concern during your stay. It does not happen often, but we always tend to issues immediately. Your comfort and cleanliness are our greatest concern. Kind regards, Kirsten Hello John, I am very surprised to receive our first 1 star as our house is a high quality listing which is honestly and accurately represented on Airbnb. We hear often it is just like in the photos!  Indeed the staircase is steep but even older travellers with a lot of luggage always easily make it up there. The bathroom IS inside the unit, not outside, and has a lock on it. The unit itself can be locked with a key. There are no mosquitos this time of year John. I am sorry this all is utter nonsense. The hallway is slightly colder than the unit but still 20 degrees Celsius. Of course traveling can be exhausting and perhaps Amsterdam especially can take its toll. Please understand the guests' comfort is and always has been our utmost importance. Whatever is going on with you, I wish you the best John. Dear guests, please note this was a very strange and demanding guest. Our heater was broken for 1 night, which we tended to and fixed immediately. I gave them the option of another hotel, or a full refund for that night. They choose the refund because it was not that bad she said. They also received everything else they requested and they seemed happy and positive with the service and the agreement. We have been super host for many years and offer an amazing place in an amazing city. Our guests' comfort is everything to us and we always tend to every need. Thank you Laura! Glad you enjoyed your stay. To clarify: the bathroom is separated from the bedroom by a door indeed, but it is not a separate room. :) Thank you Corne for your kind words. Please note the city centre is only 10 minutes walk away. The train station, which is on the edge of the center,  is further but the center starts at Leidseplein and is just 10 minutes by foot! Kind regards, Kirsten Thank you for your lovely review Lisenne! I am glad you enjoyed it. The apartment indeed is with a separate bathroom door, instead of ensuite. However, the entire floor belongs to the apartment so no people from other apartments can see you in the hall way. We will take your comment and consider to make it an ensuite :) Thank you Gregory, I am glad you enjoyed your stay! Just a note about the flight path: we are NOT under a flight path, however in very rare circumstances (like in an autumn storm) the airport changes routes for a few hours. This is a total exception and hardly ever happens!!  I think you probably did not notice the thermostat knob on the shower/bath: if you turn that the water does get super hot (70 Celsius). :) Hoi Ren√©e. Vond het erg leuk om jullie als gast te hebben. Dank voor de tip. Gaan we zeker meenemen. Hoop tot een volgende keer. Alle goeds! Thanks Dave. Much appreciated. Always welcome here! Dank u Astrid. Een mooi 2017 gewenst! Hi Amy, thank you so much for your lovely review. The stairs are pictured, but I guess we who live here in Amsterdam are more used to them then some of our guests. Happy to hear you took it up so sporty. :-) Thank you so much Maddie. All the best. We hope to welcome you again. Thanks Chris. It was a joy to host you. Welcome anytime!"
103304059,"Hi Jeremy, <br/>It is good to hear that you enjoyed your stay in our houseboat. You‚Äôre very welcome to stay again!"
106001550,"Hi Elisabetta,<br/>Sorry to read your review. Honestly, I think it‚Äôs important to pay a bit more attention when booking a place. My ad clearly states that the bed is elevated, and there are photos showing both the bed and the stairs. If you don‚Äôt like what you are seeing / reading you don‚Äôt book it. It is that simple.  And it is not fair to blame me for booking something that didn‚Äôt fit your needs. I never claimed there is a sofa bed in the apartment. If you needed a sofa bed you should have found a room with a normal bed or sofa bed. <br/>Anyways , as soon as you told me you didn‚Äôt like the bed, I even offered to cancel your reservation for free. On top of that, I took the extra time to help you find cheaper parking options. So yes, I‚Äôm quite disappointed by your review and I don‚Äôt think I deserved it. Thanks Eric for your review.  I checked the washing machine. I normally don‚Äôt use it so I didn‚Äôt know but indeed iI‚Äôs broken and I am replacing it. Mathys left my apartment in a very poor condition, with a lot of mess and a dirty kitchen. Despite the house rules, they smoked inside the apartment. We also found marijuana scattered around the living room and kitchen. On top of that, my neighbors were unhappy with the noise during late hours. They even left notes politely asking them to be quiet, but these requests were ignored. I had to send a message reminding them of the quiet hours after 10 PM. They also damaged the washing machine by breaking the detergent drawer, which the cleaning lady discovered on the bathroom floor. It‚Äôs frustrating that guests like this can behave so irresponsibly while hosts bear the consequences‚Äîmaterial loss and a bad review. Unfortunately, Airbnb does not seem to care enough about the hosts in such circumstances. I am sorry to hear about your concern about the sheets. Although they are changed with the the fresh ones after every checkout, we could have changed them again if you hesitated. Best Thank you Francesca. I am glad you enjoyed your stay :) Thank you Danielle for your kind review. I am glad you have enjoyed your stay. I wish you the best of luck to your daughter with her upcoming study :-) Thanks for the unfair review. The room and the bed are clearly described in the listing and shown in the pictures. Next time maybe you should read the listings more carefully before making a reservation and there are also many platforms where you can find an accommodation that suits you, your budget and your personality better! Thanks for the review and informing me about the mouse issue. I‚Äôve also informed all my neighbours so the necessary actions are taken. Hope your friend has also enjoyed the complimentary free stay with you :-) Thank you Sabina. I am sorry about it. I will ask my cleaning lady why it was not cleaned well. Thanks for the review. The cleaning fee obviously does not include cleaning the dishes or cups after you have used them. It is clearly mentioned in the house rules that I request kindly my guests to leave the kitchen area tidy. That is also a courteous gesture towards the cleaning lady.  I would also advise you to be a a bit more clean and tidy , especially with your hair. We have found lots of hair all around the apartment after your departure. Thanks Valent√≠n. As you mentioned the studio is in a typical Amsterdam building. The stairs can be challenging for elderly people but this is also clearly explained in the room description. I always recommend guests to look for another place with an elevator if this would be a problem. Thanks for your great detailed review, Yaron. I had already mentioned that the apartment is on the top (4th) floor in the description.  But I guess I oversaw one thing that some people could think there might be an elevator in the building. Now I have updated the description which reflects the situation completely. Thanks Thanks for your kind review. It‚Äôs a pity that you didn‚Äôt enjoy the loft bed, some guests find it a special experience. Nevertheless the bed and its location is clearly shown in the pictures. Thanks for your feedback Anne. In the ad it is clearly mentioned that the accommodation is on the top floor(4) of a typical Amsterdam building without an elevator. It is also clear in the pictures how the sleeping area is setup. I am sorry to see your poor rating based on wrong assumptions. In the future I would advise that you communicate your needs carefully with the hosts in order to avoid disappointment for everyone. <br/>Best <br/>D. Thanks for the feedback. The size of the studio is clearly mentioned in the posting and obviously what you found small space can be perfect for some other people. Next time, I would recommend you to read the description of the accommodation more carefully before making a reservation. So that you won't get disappointed and leave an unfair feedback. I am sorry to hear that sleeping in the elevated bed was scary for you. Actually this is the first time I receive a critique on this point. Some of my guests found it even fun to sleep in such a bed.  I believe the listing description is quite accurate as the bed and it's location is clearly shown in the pictures but I will also add a note it in the description.  Thank you! thank you for the review and also for the tips.  thank you for the kind review!"
106003312,"Thank you Magali, I've enjoyed hosting you. What a loving family you are! Thank you Selina and Mattea, I'm happy you enjoyed your stay. It was a pleasure to host you guys!

Thank you Ahmed, please send my love to your wonderful daughter from papi Vladimir. Thank you for supporting me, it was nice to meet and host you. Red flag: drug abuse and verbal aggression. I wonder why Ana complains about the balcony key when the door to the balcony was not locked. Maybe because she was smoking too many marijuana cigarettes on that balcony. <br/>Ana demanded that she use my kitchen while it's not available for my guests and that is mentioned in my Listing. When I told her that, she started to shout at me and assault me. <br/>Regarding the lock on the door to my guest‚Äôs room. My guests stay in my house, and I don't want to make a prison out of my house. My guests can enter any space in my room, I ask them to respect my privacy, and I respect their privacy. <br/>While Ana was arguing with me about the conditions of the contract, she signed while booking my listing, I was staying outside of my guest‚Äôs room.<br/>Later I found marijuana cigarette butts on my balcony, Ana and her guests were using drugs on my balcony without my permission and against my House Rules. The next morning, I found more marijuana cigarette butts on my balcony. The same was in the evening.<br/>We are not scared of marijuana in Amsterdam. We also know that some people can get aggressive after smoking marijuana.<br/>The last day at 9 AM before checking out Ana was staying outside her room with a marijuana cigarette, her question was where the closest coffeeshop is to buy more marijuana cigarettes.<br/>It's fine if you smoke marijuana recreationally. However, when you smoke it first thing in the morning, in Amsterdam we call it drug abuse.<br/>Drug abuse, red flag. Thank you, so nice to meet you! It's a pleasure to meet and host you! Thank you Isabela, it was great having as my guests and seeing how happy you are together. Thank you for a wonderul review! It's a pleasure to meet you and Sila! Thank you! Why the Value 3?????

J'ai appr√©ci√© votre compagnie et nos petites discussions, vous avez enrichi ma vie. Merci ! Thank you Navin, it was a pleasure to meet and host you and your friends. Merci bien, so nice to meet and host you! So nice to meet and host you girls! Hi Matthew it was a pleasure to host you and Joshua, thank you for supporting me. Thank you for your kind words and for supporting me and my volunteer activities. You are mostly welcome to visit me again. Bonjour Fran√ßois, I consider your review incorrect, misleading and therefore manipulative. I will explain why:<br/>1.	On 12 Feb 2024 you made a reservation for 4 people for 3 nights for 983.74 euros. It was the high season, Ascension Day, so the prices were higher. You requested to use my kitchen what is not included in the price. You asked politely and your booking was a good deal for me, so I‚Äôve made an exception for you and allowed you to use my kitchen. My 1st exception for you.<br/>2.	A month later, 13 March 2024 you‚Äôve requested me to cancel your reservation without paying the cancellation fee. You‚Äôve mentioned ‚Äúfamily reasons‚Äù as the reason of your request to reimburse you in full. I‚Äôve recommended you contact the Airbnb Customer Center as they are the final judge whether you are entitled to the reimbursement in full. No answer from you.<br/>3.	A fortnight later, on 28 March 2024 you‚Äôve informed me that there will be 2 guests arriving instead of the original 4 guests and requested reimbursement in the amount of 380.51 euros. So, the original deal decreased in value by about 40%. This Listing is my business, and I was losing a lot of money. However, I don‚Äôt want to rip off my guests, so I‚Äôve accepted your request. My 2nd exception for you.<br/>4.	On 15 April 2024 you agreed to use my microwave and to make coffee in the morning. There is a coffee machine, coffee, water cooker, tea, sugar, cups, plates and cutlery in your room. As an exception I have agreed to warm up your dishes in my microwave. And I have done that and brought you your warm dishes to my loggia where you and your wife were dining. My 3rd exception for you.<br/>So, we made a deal, the situation changed, and we made a new deal. I followed that deal and did everything what I promised you. Moreover, I offer you three exceptions. Next to that I saved you 380.51 euros while I lost about 300 euros. <br/>And finally. About a week after I gave you a 380.51 euros discount, you knew about it, a French lady called me. She told me that her husband and she were originally planning to stay with me together with your wife and you. She told me that you demand her to pay her part of the expenses for the accommodation with me. I told her that she owes me nothing as you will only be travelling with your wife, and all is settled now.<br/>I wonder why are you writing such a review, knowing that the reality is different? What are you trying to achieve? Thank you for your review. Speaking truly, I'm not surprised about your remark that you could smell my dogs in my house. It was the first remark that your wife made upon arriving at my house. She said: I smell dogs here. My answer was: Yes, my dogs live here. Her next remark was I don't like dogs. <br/>I write in my listing, if you don‚Äôt like dogs, please consider booking another listing. I just wonder, why have you booked my listing knowing that your wife doesn‚Äôt like dogs? <br/>My old dog Timo died the day before your arrival, he turned 14 years 3 months and 2 weeks. I hope you understand how much pain I felt after hearing your wife‚Äôs remarks. And then, if you don‚Äôt like dogs, why on earth are you choosing to stay in a house with dogs? Thank you for your nice review! Hi Joshua, what a pleasure to meet and host you. You are always welcome to stay with me again. Thaqnk you very much for staying with me, for your warm words and for the clothes that you left for homeless people, I've donated them already. Muchas gracias! Hi Gabriel, thenk you for your nice review, I'm happy to hear you've enjoyed your stay with me. I miss you already, please say Ciao to the guys. Obrigado Tiago, it was really a pleasure to meet and host you guys. You were my perfect guests! Thank you very much Marcus, you are motly welcome to stay with me again.

Hi Guillaume, it was a pleasure to meet and host you and your friends. Thank you for supporting me! Hi Robinson, Thank you very much for supporting me, I have enjoyed hosting you! Danke! Wow thank you so much Flo! <br/>To me it was great to see your mother-daughter relationship, to be jelous of! Thank you Amanda, for our nice little talks on the loggia, for your warm heart, I saw how you take care of your brother, he's a lucky boy.<br/>And thank you for supporting me.<br/>You are always welcome back. Gracias amigo and I hope to see you back! Bonjour C√©dric, thank you for your review. As I have told you, maybe next time you should read what you book before booking. As everything what you are complaining about, is mentioned in my desription. Do send love to your children, I find them really well educated. It was my pleasure to meet and host you. Our littel but quality talks were awesome and meningfull to me. And you have stolen my heart by making a picture of all of us.<br/>You are always welome back! Thank you for your review. You gave me 3 stars for Cleaniness. I believe you mixed it with the time when you were leaving. As I never saw such a mess after my guests left. Thank you! Thank you Adam & Alex, it was great to meet and host you. You made me laugh too. Thank you Zack! It was a pleasure the host you, thank you for supporting me! It was a pleasure to meet and host you Josu√©, and thank you so much for supporting me. Hi Dan and Joshua, it was a pleasure to meet and host you, and I'm happy to hear that you had a great stay. You were easy guests, always welcome back. Grazie mille Igor! It was great to host you and your wife, you are always welcome to stay with me again.

It was a pleasure to meet and host you. It was really a pleasure to meet you and Alex. I've enojed every moment of our little talks. I consider it an honour that you accepted to wear my lammycoat that is certainly older than you. And thank you for the delicious Belgian chocolate that you gave me as a present.<br/>That is one of the nice side of AirBnB, meeting wonderful people like you. Dear Nikhil, thank you for your utmost negative review. I am sorry that you did not like your stay with me.  I am sorry that your father was not prepared for our winter temperatures so he had to wear his scarf covering his head. When you arrived, I saw that your father was cold outside, he didn't have the proper clothes.<br/>I'm sorry that I did not meet your expectations. I am sorry for the rainbow flag outside my windows, I saw that you were not prepared to face that flag. <br/>I'm sorry for the stairs in my house, I saw that you were not prepared for those stairs (did you read my Listing? Amste4rdam and its stairs)<br/>I'm sorry that you forced me to make Indian tea for you and your parents. You did not bother to go to a shop to buy milk, you forced me to offer you the milk I paid for, to make you your tea your way. I was happy when I saw that your mother and father liked my tea.<br/>I am sorry that you were not prepared to see my nails with a polish. Now I understand why you got scared by the absence of locks in your room.<br/>Were you expecting me to observe you while you sleep, as you say, there are so called no curtains (there are curtains darling, just move your ass to close them). Or ask me to close them for you. But then you'd fear me being openly gay doing smth in your room.<br/>I understand your fear, I might be the first gay you meet in your life. OK, you are a male. And yes, I have a type. And I can assure you, that is NOT you.<br/>So, I consider your review utmost discriminatory and homophobic. <br/>Dear Nikhil, this world is not to hurt you. I am not to hurt you. I am not to get you in my bed either, it‚Äôs already occupied, and you are not my type. <br/>Be good, just be happy. Merci bien ! C'√©tait vraiment agr√©able de vous accueillir, vous et vos amis, et j'esp√®re vous revoir. Thank you Adrian, it was great to host you! Happy New Year! It was great to meet you and your friends, I've enjoyed your company. Thank you very much, it was nice to meet and host you. I'm pleased to hear that you've enjoyed your stay with me, thank you for your suppeort! I'm pleased to hear that you've enjoyed your stay with me, thank you for your support! I'm pleased to hear that you've enjoyed your stay with me, thank you for your support! Thank you very much, you were perfect guests! Thank you very much! Merci ! <br/>So nice to meet you and your brothers and to witness your love for each other! Thank you for your review. But what do you mean by saying Laundry was somewhat dirty? Why did not you tell me that?<br/>I do not like your remark, I consider it not fair. You know this is my business and you damage it. <br/>Not nice. Thank you Michael & Paul, what was it a pleasure to meet and host you. Best guests ever, I've enjoyed our little talks and meeting you is a treasure in my life.<br/>I'd be happy to host you again! Hi Anna, thank you for your nice review! I've enjoyed meeting and hosting you, thank you again for supporting me! Thank you for supporting me and for our little talks. I've enjoyed your company so will definitely be happy to see you again! Thank you for calling my place ""great for a cheap place to stay"". It is indeed outside the Center what I write in my description. And it is quiet in the nights, what I also write in my description. <br/>So you have chosen for a cheap quiet place outside the Center, when you booked my Listing. And after that you give me 3 stars for Location. <br/>I can assure you that every owner of a Listing will not be pleased to receive 3 stars. So next time you book a Listing here, please decide whether you go cheap and stay far from the Center in a quiet residential area, or you go expensive and stay in the very Center that never sleeps.<br/>Needless to say that I will not want to host you again, all the best! Thank you very much Daniel, I'd be happy to see you again. Thank you very much for your kind words, it was a pleasure to host you. <br/>All the best, grazie mille! Thank you very much! It was a pleasure to meet and host you, thank you very much for your private feedback, I really appreciate! Chiara & Riccardo, grazie mille for your warm words and kind review. And thank you for supporting me. Hi Joachim, <br/>Thank you very much for your nice review. It was a pleasure to meet and host you. The feeling is mutual, great to meet you. I've enjoyed our little talks and remember, your generation is better than mine. Keep it up! It was great to meet and host you, thank you and hope to see you again! Thank you for your flexibility and understanding! You were just perfect guests and I adore your puppy! Merci bien ! It was a pleasure to meet and host you! Merci, you are always welcome back! Thank you, you are always welcome back! Thank you Gonzalo! You were the best guests! Itr was a pleasure to meet and host you Thank you Flo, it was a pleasure to host you! Would be happy to see you again. Pleasure to host you! Thank you so much and it was really a pleasure to meet and to host you. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you Cameron, I shall put a sign Private at the Laundry. Thank you Dan, I'm happy to meet and host you. Thank you very much. I'm glad you share my care for the environment. Dear Michelle, I'm a bit disappointed by your bad review. <br/>It's not my fault that you don't really speak English and failed to operate the ticket machine even after you called me, so that it takes you longer to get to the Center. Next to that it means to me that you have not read the Guidebook, description and the amenities as it's all in there. It's also mentioned that there is no fridge in the room.<br/>And please tell your friend that it's OK to be friendly, especially when your host carries on the stairs your heavy suitcase of a size of a cabinet.<br/>So I consider your review not fair. Thank you very much, I'm happy to hear that you like your stay with me. Thank you so much guys, you were excellent guests! Thank you so much for staying with me and especially for our little chats! You were perfect guests for me! Than k you very much Sophia. It was a pleasure to meet and host you. Thank you very much, it was a pleasure to meet and host you guys! Thanks you guys, it was a pleasure to meet you and I appreciate our little talks. It was funny to get 4 guys instead of 2, at 4 in the morning. But they were tipsy, friendly and funny. And you solved this problem in accordance with my expectations, thank you.<br/>Gezellige gasten! It was a pleasure to meet you Jonny, you are one of my favourite guests I‚Äôm very disappointed about this review and I consider it NOT FAIR.<br/>You complain about narrow stairs what means that you didn‚Äôt read my Listing as the stairs are mentioned in it. So, you complain about something that is in the contract what you have signed for. NOT FAIR.<br/>You complain that there‚Äôs no writing table in the room though all the amenities are mentioned in my Listing and there are clear 360 degrees pictures of the room. You could have seen the furniture in the room if you have checked the pictures. So, you complain about something that is in the contract what you have signed for. NOT FAIR.<br/>You complain about absence of a common area for guests however it‚Äôs clearly specified in my Listing that you rent a room for guests and not my Living room. So, you complain about something that is in the contract what you have signed for. NOT FAIR.<br/>And by the way I have invited you for a chat and drinks in my Living room, as a gesture of my hospitality. I‚Äôm sad that you do not value that.<br/>You complain that your room was not big enough however you chose to travel with immensely huge suitcases that took a lot of space in the room, especially while open. I therefore offered you a possibility to keep your suitcases of a size of a big cabinet, in my private Walk in Wardrobe, free of charge. I‚Äôm sad that you do not value that.<br/>My foster son checked you in and he brought at least one of your huge suitcases up the stairs. When you were going to Belgium in between for a couple of days I offered you to store your suitcases in my Laundry, against a very low fee. Meaning that you wouldn‚Äôt need to carry them to the Central Station and because your suitcases were so huge that they wouldn‚Äôt fit in the lockers at the Central Station. I‚Äôm sad that you do not value that.<br/>I‚Äôm sorry that you experienced as unpleasant that my private guests and I were smoking on the loggia. I‚Äôm glad it was not marijuana as quite many of my guests do enjoy this freedom in Amsterdam. However, it‚Äôs mentioned in my Listing that smoking is allowed on the loggia. So, you complain about something that is in the contract what you have signed for. NOT FAIR.<br/>Next to that you gave me 3 stars of 5 for Cleanliness. You only indicate Common areas without specifying what exactly was not clean enough, to your opinion. As I have a professional cleaning assistance and none of my guests was ever complaining about dirt in my house, I think it was the ashtray on the loggia. I‚Äôm quite surprised how could an ashtray on the loggia be a dirty house, as you were not even using the loggia. NOT FAIR.<br/>You gave me quite some advice and I‚Äôm thankful to you for that. Let me give you some in return.<br/>1. Do your homework and read the Listing carefully before you book it and sign the contract. To avoid your disappointment and as a result, complaining about something you have signed for.<br/>2. Make some research and comparison of different Listings and hotels, so that you are familiar with the possibilities and prices. You complain about the simplicity of the furniture in the room however you were renting a private room for the price of a 4 beds dormitory in a hostel 3 blocks away from my house. <br/>You complain about the absence of a Living room for the guest but then you should have rented an apartment. I‚Äôm a Co-host of my neighbor and he has a beautiful apartment just across mine. The price ‚Äì as from 250 euro per night. So, should you be interested, just let me know.<br/>3. And the finally. While travelling abroad, do not expect home.<br/>In the end I would like to thank you one more time for the beautiful presents that you brought me, I value that a lot and I really love them. Thank you so much, I was happy to meet you. Thank you Wesley, it was great to meet and host you! Thank you very much Thank you! Thank you Zac, it was a pleasure to meet and host you Thank you Leo, ii was great to host you! Thank you Dusan, Was nice to meet and host you Thank you Timothy! It's so pity to see that some guests misuse the feedback possibility to cover their own limitations. Or maybe Kadir was still high from all the marijuana, they smoked all the time and the first thing in the morning. <br/>This is what happened with this guest.<br/>Unfortunately communication was quite poor, I guess it's a language issue. About a day before arrival I received a request to change the amount of nights from two to one. There was no any explanation given by Kadir of this sudden change of the booking. As this doesn't meet my requirement of minimum stay in the weekend of 2 nights, I have not accepted this change of booking and explained to Kadir why. No response on that. A day before arrival I send all my guest a standard message on how to get to my house and the Check In info. I also requested Kadir to indicate their estimated time of arrival. No response to that either. My Check In time-frame if from 4 to 8 PM. A quarter before 11 PM I received a message from Kadir that they would arrive on 15 minutes. Obviously I was forced to stay home on a Friday night to ensure Kadir and his travel companion could enter my house and Check In. Thank you very much Lars! It was a pleasure to meet you too! Hi Sai, I'm so happy to meet and host you!<br/> Thank you so much for your warm words Alexandre, I had a great time hosting you and quite some fun with you guys! Dear Julia, thank you for your review. You give me 4 stars for Cleanliness, I'm sorry that you consider my facilities not clean enough for 5 stars. You have arrived at about 10 in the morning, 6 hours before your Check In and while my other guests were still sleeping because their Check Out is at Noon. Nevertheless I let you in my house to leave your luggage and to use the toilet after 12 hours bus trip for you.<br/>I'm sorry to let you use the toilet that I haven't cleaned for you, even though it was 6 hours before your Check In.<br/>Thank you for your remark, you help me improve! Thank you very much Jose, it was a pleasure to host you! Thank you, it was a pleasure to meet and host you! Muito obrigado Emerson, it was a pleasure to meet and host you! Thank you very much, it was a pleasure to host you! Thank you very much, it was a pleasure to host you! Thank you so much, it was a pleasure to host you!
