13373658,"Friendly couple,  charming rather discreet. Georges and his colleagues were basically very likeable guests. Unfortunately not very mindful... It was (in case of storm warning!) Fire in the tiled stove, the slider by the fireplace was still closed and the whole house was then full of smoke. (I have other rooms and the guests complained logically). Then they just left without informing me that there were problems. I had to go ""emergency"" into the room to get the half burning wood from the stove, where wind could have burned my (or neighbor) house! I find this to be very negligent and STRONGLY recommend George to behave appropriately and never leave a smoking/hot fire unattended. Nowhere. Also otherwise their behavior was rather inappropriate (after one night a lot of dirt in the room, shower under water, compost (coffee grounds) not separated, etc.).  Unfortunately, no full recommendation from me, sorry... Pleasant couple, no difficulty. Everything was perfect. Thank you Georges! Georges and his partner were very welcoming guests ,to recommend to any host"

15816089,"Alexandra communicated fine at first. It turned out that they would no longer come with two couples but more with two separate groups? After arriving, she asked for a fourth towel that turned out to be there after further information. The second last night we were called out of bed at 1:30 am (in the middle of the night); first, Alexandra indicated that they had locked themselves out and later it turned out that the lockbox was jammed. So we were startled for nothing in the middle of the night.  However, it seemed like she thought this was the most ordinary thing in the world. She even expected someone to be around with a spare key. (which is also there, but fortunately not yet passed on to Alexandra because then those wrs were also called awake in the middle of the night). So I wouldn't want to invite her to my house again."

A disappointing experience."

36714642,"Communication with Salvatore was complicated. He responded late to report an elevator and cleanliness issue. The elevator, renovated the day before, did not go down to the ground floor because of a badly reset button ‚Äî he called us liars about it, which we find inappropriate and inelegant, especially since we have the evidence from the property manager. On the housekeeping side, the former tenant clearly wrote that the apartment was ‚Äúvery clean‚Äù, and cleaning was done before she arrived. To reassure him, we offered to have someone come back to clean again, but he refused. His photos showed a little dust behind the TV or under the cabinet, easily correctable in a 30 m¬≤. Salvatore seems very demanding in these different comments, which we respect, even if we were somewhat surprised by the condition in which he left the premises (hair, dirty coffee maker, ""brown"" traces in the bathtub). Nothing serious, though. Super friendly and kind guests! Having the opportunity to host people like them is an honor, Thank you!!"

The reservation was made without a problem, we maintained communication with the guest prior to their arrival, on the day of their visit the timely and correct access details were sent but they did not read them and when asking for the location again there was an error that we corrected at the moment.
Subsequently at night  (10:40) we were notified that the guest was obstructing the pedestrian space of the parking lot, even though upon arrival they were sent instructions and photos with measures to avoid problems with the other tenants, which is why we had to communicate with him to move his unit, he replied that he would do it the next day to what we told him to be at the time because someone could not go down and moved him.
Today before your departure he reports things that were apparently dirty ,that there was no soap and yes there is, which is false since we sent photographic report of each area to avoid these things, and we thought he was bothered by the issue of parking. Wonderful guests, they left the house in perfect condition. I recommend them to any other Airbnb host thank you so much for coming! It was truly happy to host Jonathan.
