51027,"Laura and Arjun were brilliant hosts and their flat was absolutely perfect for our stay. The flat is cosy and ideal for a couple - with all mod cons and an amazing shower and very comfy bed! Breakfast is sweetly brought to you every morning on a tray - freshly boiled eggs, coffee just as you like it, freshly squeezed orange juice etc - amazing and a real treat!<br/>The flat is in the basement of their grand canal side house - it is absolutely beautiful. We loved the area - a stones throw from all the buzz and bustle of the canal rings but calm and peaceful. We found we were able to walk to every area we wanted to go to and hired bikes one day which was a highlight. <br/>Arjun and Laura were on hand to help with anything and had lots of great restaurant recommendations - we tried out the Indonesian suggestion which was delicious. <br/>A truly memorable experience and we hope to come back soon!<br/>"
88658,"truus offers a nice studio with a terrace in a quiet neighbourhood in the former eastern docklands of amsterdam - surrounded by water, and all of the cities stunning contemporary architecture, not far from the central station. the studio is well equiped, it even includes service by truus who is very friendly and generous."
102821,"I just want everybody to know that Joke was a perfect host for my sister and me. We felt home the moment we arrived late at evening because of her warm welcome. She made us coffee, served us a pie and gave us quick information about the neighborhood and the city in gerenal. A highlight to point out were the amazing breakfasts Joke prepared every morning on the attached veranda. All rooms were perfectly clean as well as the sheets and towels. <br/><br/>The neighborhood itself was also very nice. From Mercatorplein you can easily walk to the city and see how architecture has changed over the decades. This takes you roughly 45 minutes. What is more, there is a tram station directly in front of the appartment with two different lines taking you wherever you want to go in short time.<br/><br/>All in all it was a perfect stay and I can highly recommend Joke as a host."
104846,"Jake and Ayla's boat was the perfect spot for our brief visit to Amsterdam. They graciously allowed us to drop our bags prior to check-in so we could start exploring right away. We didn't have to walk far to get to fantastic areas of town (I highly recommend seeing a movie at The Movies, and climbing up the Westerkerk church tower!) Bed was comfy, cookies were tasty, and local beer they provided was such a nice touch.<br/><br/>Thanks guys for a great stay! :)"
112013,The location could not have been better. We were there when they had construction going on which they told us about before excepting our booking. The reality was it was no big deal at all! If i am looking for a complaint it would only be that we had just one set of keys and needed to lock up on each time we came or left. With two of us it was a bit of an inconvenience to leave separately.  That is the only complaint i could muster as everything else was awesome!! I would highly recommend to anybody visiting Amsterdam!
113916,"Truus was very welcoming and nice - when we arrived she gave us a map with great recommendations for sights, restaurants and places in Amsterdam! And we were blown away by the beautiful room - in reality it's even prettier than on the pictures. We also enjoyed the region where Eastendroom is located: not too far from the city center, in a very calm and modern residential area. All in all it was the perfect accommodation!"
115275,What a fantastic place.  IDEAL location and neat as a pin. Ingo was a perfect host and very flexible when we were faced with some tough weather.  The space was bright and cheerful even on the stormiest days.  The kitchen was well equip and shops were just a short walk along the canal.
124772,"The hosts were wonderful - great people, really caring and response. The place was also incredible -- what a wonderful location! And the flat has everything you need. Highly recommended!"
133841,"Hein, an artist and a thinker, lives in an unusual, suggestive loft, a former synagogue converted into a factory then turned into an apartment by Hein himself. The place is unique, as is the pied-à-terre that Hein rents. I was welcomed with a bottle of white wine and a long conversation on philosophical and existential topics. Isn't that the original spirit of Airbnb? Meeting people and exchange with them? I'll therefore give five stars to Hein and his beautiful studio, which is also very confortable, quiet, and perfectly located (close to a lively students' area with a wonderful movie theater, the Kriterion, the botanical garden, and lots of inexpensive, genuine restaurants, cafes, and bars)."
148839,"Corina's place in Jordaan is a great location for exploring Amsterdam - walking distance to the Dam, and many other tourist locations. The accommodation is comfortable, quiet, and has everything you need for a short stay. Corina has books about Amsterdam for travellers wanting to know more. The wifi was a bonus. Corina was just lovely to chat with - so friendly and helpful. Highly recommended. "
158169,"What a pleasure to be welcomed with a warm stove in a wooden cabin!   <br/>I would be tempted to give a bad grade, so that I could keep the venue un-used, but it would not be fair ...  Everytime I come to Amsterdam, I try to stay at Marga's and Rico's. Their cabin has become my dutch home. "
164729,"Comfortable apartment in a residential neighborhood, so it's very quiet. Fairly close to the train station, 10 minutes by bus. Fenno is very easy to deal with, very communicative, so it wasn't a problem to check in and out, he's reliable. The apartment is well equipped and comfortable, back porch is a plus especially in summer. Thanks! Ester is very professional. Communication beforehand was very smooth, as well as the checking-in. The apartment is stunning. Large, modern, very clean and tidy, providing everything you could think of (kitchen, bath utensils). She welcomed us warmly, had fresh flowers and a bottle of wine ready for us. Thank you very much for that! That you can have bikes to use as a free extra is just great. Ester always helped us if we needed something and made our stay extra pleasant. The location was great for us too, it's a cute but vivid neighborhood. I would absolutely recommend that place!"
181071,"Absolutely perfect: impeccably clean, ideally located, filled with sunlight. Robert couldn't have been more attentive or accommodating. The bus goes directly from the airport to a stop 5 minutes' walking distance to the flat, while 10 minutes on foot takes you to the heart of the center. Truly, we felt so incredibly fortunate to have found this little gem. If you're looking for ease, simplicity, and sunshine, this one's for you."
184519,"Toetsie was a fantastic host and her place is the perfect setup for guests. She welcomed us even though we were late and gave us free transport cards for the city, keys and maps. Gifts of wine, juice and everything we needed for breakfast. We only met her the first night but she gave us great recommendations. We would definitely stay with her again!"
228091,"This was the best lodging experience I could ever had in Amsterdam.  Let's start with the house boat, is beautiful, cozy, clean, spacious, Internet worked perfectly all over the house boat, there is nothing bad to say about this place, the place is more beautiful of the pictures shown in the listing.  It is equiped with everything, microwave, fridge, stove, coffee maker, everything. The neighborhood is incredible, 15 to 20 minutes walking to main sites or 5 in bicycle; safe, clean, beautiful, out of the crazyness of the city.  The hosts are great people, great communication, always asking about how we feel, if everything is ok, fast response.  I evaluate a lot of places before booking this and once there I walked all over the city to compare and there is not a better option.  This just gives you the real experience of living in a house boat in Amsterdam."
235420,"This was an impeccable experience from the time of booking. David responded quickly to messages and was a welcoming host when we arrived. Very convenient to the train station and within easy reach of all sights, this place feels like a boutique hotel room, complete with breakfast that arrives in a basket outside the door. Although the neighborhood is lively, the room is quiet and we slept very well in the comfortable bed. We weren't crazy about the tapas restaurant downstairs, but loved the café in the ""Jesus loves you"" building around the corner from the apartment.  "
244234,Doet waited for us a bit later than the usual hours and presented us the room and a book with good addresses and advices to discore the city. She was nice enough to let us stock our luggage for our last day in Amsterdam.
252160,Mischa went out of his way to make things easy for us.  He even made us coffee  and very kindly allowed us to drop off our luggage even before checkin time.  You cannot beat the value and it's only a 5 minute walk from the metro to central amsterdam.  What a great host!!
253134,"I've stayed in some great AirBnBs in my time, but Ayla and Jake's takes the cake. The houseboat was beautiful and comfortable; the hosts were incredibly friendly, welcoming, and generous (leaving us great wine, beer, and chocolate!); and the location was fabulous. I can't wait to stay here again when I return to Amsterdam- hopefully very soon.  Stijn's boat was the second I stayed on in Amsterdam, and it was definitely more boat-y, for better and for worse. It's a super-cool and comfortable space with great views, and Stijn was very welcoming, communicative, and helpful. However, while other reviews had mentioned that accessing the boat was an adventure, I wasn't prepared for what that would mean. Getting my big suitcase on board was pretty brutal (although Stijn was great about helping me on the way out) and navigating narrow passages across other boats (some piled with dirty and rusty objects) in my dress clothes was also a challenge. Finally, there were some loud noises the boat made that woke me during the night. All in all, I would recommend Stijn's boat for heavy sleepers, light packers, and folks who will be dressing casually. That said, I want to emphasize that Stijn was a great host- these minor things that didn't work for me are all beyond his control. "
313949,"Marga is such a nice person! Good vibes, great location, very easy to communicate with, generous!<br/>The room was perfect, very cosy, I felt like home!<br/>I would definitely go back there!"
315774,"We spent a great vacations staing in Stephan's apartment! Apartment was very comfortable, clearn and cozy, we were feeling  like at home. It's 15 min from Central Station, very close to differents places of interest. Stephan was a great host, he was very polite, charming and always ready to help! "
327957,"Marian and Simon are sweet and friendly, dependable and super helpful at all times! Generally up for an interesting chat, too. All rooms were impeccably clean and tastefully decorated, the bed and bathtub luxurious with plenty of fresh towels. Radiators and windows working well, so temperature adjustable to your needs. Nice location: quiet and peaceful, right next to Vondelpark, yet plenty of tasty restaurants and a tram station right around the corner.  It is said of us Germans that we always complain. Well, I couldnt find anything to complain about, no matter how hard I tried! "
332985,This apartment near the Vondelpark is very cosy and clean. It is situated in a quiet residential area but just minutes from good restaurants and shops. We enjoyed our stay very much. The communication with Karen was always and prompt and very helpful. We would definitely come again
361467,"I had a wonderful stay with Stephanie and Sebastian in Amsterdam. Stephanie welcomed me and was extremely helpful during my stay with practical stuff like bike rental, recommendations etc. The apartment is lovely and very well designed and I really enjoyed. A+ for hosting. I hope the apartment is available next time I'm in Amsterdam :) "
367503,"Wonderful apartment (the pictures don't lie), very cozy and indeed a quiet area (although very central and if you rent a bike the center is reachable within 5min). Mijef and Henk are a very funny and welcoming hosts. They provide you with every information you need, fresh towels and even fruits and a bottle of wine were waiting for us. Besides that you have the feeling of living on your own in this beautiful typical dutch house. Very tastefully designed (you feel like living in a interiour design house!). Absolutely recommendable!"
367862,"Staying at Toetsie's place was great. She's a wonderful and generous woman, very helpful with figuring out things to do and see in town. The setup of the rooms with a mini-kitchen is spacious and comfortable. And Roky the cat is a sweet little companion. The apartment is in an ideal location close to trams, metro, and buses with many Amsterdam sights also in walkable distance. I would definitely recommend her place!"
378290,"My 2 friends and I loved our stay at Gina's garden house. It is at the back of Gina's main house through a garage/storage area with separate keys so it is very private and apart from the main building. Gina met us when we arrive and there was a bottle of wine, chocolates, bottles of water, coffee, shower gel/shampoo etc etc. - she went above and beyond what you would expect from an Airbnb host.<br/>The house is on 2 floors with the living area downstairs and 2 bedrooms upstairs (no doors but very thick curtains for privacy). We went into the centre of Amsterdam a great deal and that was only one stop on the train or 2 trams - all within 5/10 mins walking distance.<br/>I would recommend Gina as a host - she even posted my friend's phone back to me after we accidentally dropped it in the rubbish when we left!<br/><br/>10 out of 10. Thanks Gina!"
399447,"We absolutely loved staying here.   Beautiful, clean, and quiet.  Henk and Kelli were quick to respond to all inquiries and very flexible.   Loved having coffee on the deck each morning.   "
401817,"On my check-in date Marijke changed her plans to be able to meet me and my friends which was very kind of her (instead of leaving the key somewhere or with someone else). She came out to pick us up with her big smile, making our first meeting a real pleasure. Then she explained everything about the apartment, the area nearby, the transport. This was really helpful!<br/><br/>The description of the room is exactly how it was in real. I would confidently say the lower bed is pretty comfortable. The neighbourhood was pretty quiet and nice. There is a coffee place very close with amazing breakfast and coffee. <br/><br/>I would definitely recommend staying with Marijke!"
411842,"There was an emergency so I didn't go. Yet Matthijs has been very helpful and kind. Would definitely stay at his place when  I go to Amsterdam next tim,"
440298,Corina was very friendly and gave us some nice tips of where to see in Amsterdam. The location was perfect as we could easily walk everywhere and it feels safe in the area. 
440425,"What a lovely little jewel box of a room! The cupboard bed is a delight, and the location of the apartment is well-situated for exploring Central Amsterdam. The breakfast at De Laatste Kriumel, while a five minute walk away, is superb."
443512,"From the beginning to the end of our stay, it felt like the best choice we could have done. Sander and Kathelijn have been really helpful and friendly, and the house is in a perfect location : close on the busy Leidseplein and walking distance to any touristic interest Amsterdam has to offer. Also on the edge of a much more local district full of small restaurant and very old bars.<br/><br/>The house itself is very spacious and full of charm. Very good place to stay in a vibrant neoghbourhood"
470368,Lovely apartment in a very quiet location in the outskirts of the city. Living room is lovely with big windows and loads of light. Also a little balcony off the kitchen. <br/>Probably 8 mins walk to the team which gets you into the centre or museums in 15-20 mins. Mirjam is helpful with a map and guidebooks ready and suggestions for places to eat and drink. I would defiantly recommend. <br/>
479445,"I really enjoyed my stay with Marga and Rico.  Marga met me at the station and was flexible about timing.  The cottage is rustic and cozy and in a quiet, non-touristy part of the city.  It is a treat to be on the river and watch the rowers and the wildlife.  There are bikes available for rental and I'd recommend using them.  It is only 15 minutes into the center and it is a pleasure to cycle in this most cycle-friendly of cities.  The cottage has a nice big desk, a wood stove which you can use, and a characterful old piano.  I would be glad to stay again and recommend it highly!"
482037,"Could have not found a better place to stay... wow..<br/>Great location and lovely warm hosts.<br/>I would highly recommend this apartment.<br/>Very clean and very modern.<br/>Great cafe with free wifi also right opposite on the canal.<br/>Thank you Nicolet for having us. We hope to come again and I will recommend your place to our friends. "
500530,"The apartment is truly spectacular. Recently renovated, it has all you could need. The furniture is modern and the bed is really comfortable. The kitchen had a coffee maker and all you'd need to cook basic meals - but there are so many good places to eat really close by. The rooftop patio was huge and had a nice view. Now on the flip side, the arrival was a little confusing and I would have expected the place to be a bit cleaner. Despite that, I would really recommend this apartment."
517029,Laura and her husband Arjen were very welcoming and helpful throughout the weekend and provided us with a lovely apartment and delicious breakfast each morning. The area was quiet and pretty and not far from the centre of Amsterdam by foot. 
517666,Ingo was a terrific host - and his place is so beautiful! What a great experience all around.
532213,"I stayed with Rosie before so the fact I went back is all you need to know. Great location: close to the centre without being in the craziness, easy to get to from Zuid/airport, and a quick bus across town to Amstel station where I was working. Simple, clean, warm, modern room. Good wifi. The perfect stay for me as a businessman Lovely room on the top floor of the apartment so it feels like your own place. Bathroom right next door. Big comfortable bed. Photos do it justice. Great location - close to the centre but quiet enough for a good nights sleep. Rosie was very patient with me as my flight was late, and very helpful when I arrived. All in all, great stay. <br/> I was in Amsterdam on business. Reuben met me as I arrived. Very nice, welcoming guy. Room was clean, simple and comfortable. Fantastic location in one of the best locations in Amsterdam. "
546371,"I have taken the time to write this review because it is so well deserved.   Words can hardly do justice to this beautiful home.   I have tried to share how wonderful it is.  This is by far the best accommodations I have stayed in including some of the finest hotels.  I go to Amsterdam every couple of years and will be sure to book Petra's place well in advance.  Petra is a classy and charming lady who is warm and kind.  She was always available and went out of her way to make my stay as comfortable as possible.   She even provided a few extras that were not expected but greatly appreciated.  Her communication was outstanding and she was so patient as I had problems with the rail-strike and actually arrived a day late.  After a harrowing trip her warm welcome was just what I needed.  We had some lovely conversations over the deliicious coffee she brought each morning.  I do not eat breakfast but what she provided for other guests looked wonderful.  Not only is Petra an incredible hostess but the accommodations were equally incredible (over the top).  The apartment appeared to be brand new and done with the most up to date cabinets, fixtures, etc and with impeccable taste.   The sleeping room was very large, bright and spotlessly clean.   It was beautifully decorated  and had a lovely balcony.   The bed was like sleeping on a cloud.   The sheets and bedding were crisp and soft.  There was no outside noise so sleeping was easy and restful.  There was a safe and a large screen tv.   The kitchen was also very large, bright and airy and totally equipped.  It was so clean and fresh it looked like it had not been used.  The bathroom was also huge, spotless and had every amenity one would need; including many towels, bathrobe and slippers.  All things provided were high quality.  The shower was large and wonderful with its own little dressing area.  Petra said they had completely renovated the apartment and it showed as everything was handcrafted and showed a pride of ownership one rarely sees.   There was a second bedroom with its own bath that was equally as beautiful as mine was.   The location was also great right next to the park, good restaurants and the tram stop right at the corner, five minutes to town.  The neighborhood was lovely and near enough but out of the downtown noise and the crowds.  I am so grateful that I had the opportunity to experience such luxury and to meet someone as special as Petra.  I feel I have made a new good friend.   Thank you.  Jayne"
551161,"Mijef really made us feel welcome in her house and provided us with all sorts of little luxuries that made a big difference - food for breakfast  in the fridge, a bottle of wine, an adaptor plug, peppermints and lots of information on Amstersdam. Her house is full of really interesting details and art and the room is lovely and spacious. The area was perfect since we could walk pretty much anywhere or the bus and tram stops are 5 mins away. There are also lots of food shops and restaurants in the immediate area. Although the room is at the front of the house it is very quiet and the bed extremely comfortable.  We had a lovely time in Amsterdam and would recommend the House to anyone."
559770,"Wir kamen aus Frankreich und aus Deutschland und haben zu fünft das Apartement gemietet. Und wir waren restlos begeistert. Tessas heim ist sehr sauber, sehr ordentlich - und vor allem sehr, sehr gemütlich. In einer wunderbaren, ruhigen Wohngegend gelegen und für Kinder geeignet. Nur ein paar Minuten von der nächsten Tram entfernt, hat Tessa ein kleines Paradies geschaffen. Das Apartment ist mit viel Liebe zum Detail eingerichtet. Sehr hilfreich auch die Karten und das Booklet, in dem Tessa einiges Wissenswerte zusammen gestellt hat. Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt."
560966,"Vibeke was a great host, she gave excellent recommendations and instructions for getting around the city. Her apartment has good connections the city centre and plenty of places nearby for eating or drinking or getting supplies. <br/>I really enjoyed my stay here, the room is spacious and comfortable. "
564588,Charming host - excellent apartment.... thanks for having us.
593343,"Margo's flat is really nice, very clean, also has extra touches like fresh flowers plus interesting guide & history books. She is a very accommodating host worked with our early arrival, let us bring our bags ahead of time. The breakfast foods were plentiful, we even had treats. The location is great too. We plan to stay there again in a couple of weeks. Super! Thanks Margot, Eric & Ilse This was our second time staying at Margot's flat. We felt right at home & the flat was again very clean and welcoming with fresh flowers. Breakfast , snacks were plentiful. Margot goes the extra mile to provide traditional Dutch specialties. We're recommending friends & family to stay here when visiting Amsterdam. Loved the neighborhood too."
608486,"The apartment is very well located and I could walk anywhere from there. I went back to the train station on foot, it was very easy to go anywhere.  It is super convenient! The hosts were also very helpful and accommodating. The room is smoke-free, but it is allowed to smoke in the living room, so the hosts closed the door to the corridor to keep the rooms away from the smoke, so I had no problem with it. I also like that the bathroom and the toilet are separated, it is really convenient!"
627243,"Great communication, awesome location, comfortable bed, clean room and bathroom, delicious breakfast, and above all... Friendly hosts! On airbnb you can find many affordable places in good locations, but this one is a special one & arguably one of the best. As a frequent traveller and user of airbnb what makes a place stand out besides location and comfortable bed is: friendly host. Matthijs is a great host & he took the time to talk and show genuine interest in our trip plans. He has excellent suggestions. He happily let us keep our luggage after check out and provide us with towels in case we want a second shower before our late flight.<br/>Matthijs does that extra bit effortlessly to make your stay even better. Other great pluses: beautiful breakfast, comfortable traditional bed, quiet at night, big bathroom with clean thick towels provided, very clean room nicely decorated, and excellent location.<br/>We like it on Facebook and it's the first time we will put recommendation on trip advisor for a place we used through airbnb."
634096,"Robert made my friend and I feel very welcome. He greeted us from the bus station and helped us carry our bags up the stairs. He also kept in touch throughout our stay. The location is wonderful and the apartment was small but cozy and had all of the amenities we needed. One thing to note if you're staying in the summer is that the apartment is on the top floor, so it can get a bit hot and stuffy, particularly in the morning. Otherwise, really great place."
641782,We have been two days in this awesome cozy apartment. It has every little detail you can imagine. Gabriel was a very generous host. He offered himself for any need we may have. The apartment is really close to the city centre by tram although you may also choose to go by feet. The apartment is next to a park so it is very quiet on nights. So far our best experience in Airbnb. <br/>Thank you very much Gabriel and Marloes!
678553,"Willbert est un hôte exceptionnel. D'une gentillesse extrême, il vous accueille chaleureusement et vous aide à vous installer et vous sentir chez vous. Lors de l'accueil, il vous donne de précieux conseils pour découvrir cette superbe ville. La communication a toujours été parfaite et rapide avant notre arrivée. Concernant la chambre, son emplacement est idéal et elle dispose de tout le nécessaire pour passer un agréable séjour. Nous avons tout fait à pied tant nous étions proche du centre ville. Un adresse à retenir pour vos séjours à Amsterdam !"
683493,"Overall, this was not a pleasant experience. The host not very responsive, but very strict. <br/><br/>We booked the place for three days, but due to a change in personal plan, we asked if we can cancel the first day. That was more than 40 days before our trip. The host said she would look into this after her travel, and a few days later, she replied that we could not cancel a day because strict policy applies. I asked the host to do us a favor, but also inquired which part of the policy says the booking couldn't be cancelled by part. The host did not point me to the relevant policy, but impatiently stated that it was complicated to cancel a day, and asked us to either cancel all or leave the way it is, and she is ""fine"" with either. I asked, if we cancel all, whether she would charge 50% cancellation fees.  This time she ignored our message and never replied.  We ended up for paying for three days, but we do not blame her for the additional day charge as we chose not to push further on this point. <br/><br/>The host was also very particular about house rules. For example, the host told us the breakfast starts at 9 and she would knock on our door when it is ready. We waited until 9:12 and decide to go downstairs to say hi. Before we finished the ""good morning"" greeting, she demanded us to return upstairs, because she clearly told us that she would ""knock out door when the breakfast is ready"". I indeed remember this instruction, but didn't expect her to be so strict about this, especially when it is her who was late for breakfast after we indicated our willingness to leave for museums as early as possible to avoid long queue and we did not mean to chase her at all.  <br/><br/>By the way, the toilet was shocking noisy, which would likely wake up your roommate if you use it in night. "
691481,"Room is spacious, clean and all advertised features available. The huge bathroom is a real future with high tech spa experience. Not quite optimal is the sound proofing: while trying to sleep in after a ""night in amsterdam"" (-; the scurrying around of other guests and/or host made this virtually impossible. Would still recommend the place though for great price/value ratio"
697414,Beautiful apartment and central to everything. I stayed here with my husband and another couple and we had a wonderful time exploring Amsterdam. It was great to be able to walk everywhere and have a place to call home in the middle of everything. Very comfortable beds and a view of the canals! Would definitely stay here again. 
699371,"Nice, safe, quiet neighborhood.  Know that you will need to heft your luggage up three flights of stairs on narrow staircases. You will have to share the bathroom with guests from one other bedroom on the same floor.<br/><br/>Be aware as Rosie will indeed tell you when you arrive, that walls are thin and therefore you will not be able to speak on the phone in your room, on the balcony, or on the bench in front of the house.  Unfortunately, you may only speak in the living room and your private conversations will be overheard.<br/><br/>Breakfast is at 9 AM only.  Unfortunately, the hostess is not flexible on this time, and does not even leave you a piece of fruit.  Therefore, if you have a tour where you need to leave even at 8:30, or you want to beat the lines at Anne Frank house, you will miss breakfast.<br/>I had breakfast only once at the house during my four night stay and it was simple continental, nothing to write home about. <br/><br/>For myself, I would not stay here again. "
704276,"Really welcoming and able to accommodate at the last minute. Highly recommend and would stay again!<br/><br/>The vessel was fully stocked and extremely well decorated. The lighting, minimal furniture, total atmosphere was perfect!<br/><br/>Internet was strong. Very close to city center!<br/><br/> Some tourists walked by and ask if they could take pictures. <br/>---<br/>Only negatives I can think of was that there were sounds associated with the vessel being attached to the street - sounded like pipe sounds. Bit loud in my bed! Very minor thing and probably won't bother most people.<br/><br/>"
747921,"This accommodation is a self-contained section of a bigger boat, where Flip lives. So the included breakfast (a very generous one!) comes fresh every morning served at your table. <br/>We've loved the outdoor section (at the end of the pier) with a table setting where we could have a drink at night watching the beautiful canal view and appreciating the calm of this area. You even get the fragrance of a jasmine bush, which is really lovely.<br/>We've used the two bicycles everyday, which allowed us to easily access everything in Amsterdam. You can find everything in less than 5 min. away (cafés, restaurants, bars, grocery, and many very cute shops namely on Haarlemmerdijt/Haarlemmerstraat)<br/>I recommend Flip's boat, as I couldn't imagine a better way to enjoy Amsterdam! "
748115,"The location of this airbnb is perfect, close to everything a short time visitor would want to see. Matthijs was a great host. The breakfast  provided at a nearby cafe was delicious. "
774394,"Hans's apartment was excellent! Very specious, clean and conveniently located. We had a very pleasant stay and would definitely stay here again. "
803744,"Gina was a nice host, allowing me to hang out in the livingroom until the room was available. She was pleasant and available despite being ill. The flat however was disappointing. It was a bit dirty and had a thick smell of cigarette smoke. I wish this would have been in the listing description because although the room was smoke free, I have asthma so the flat irritated my lungs. I didn't read enough reviews to know this ahead of time.  The bed was ok, but the room's window faced a noisy street at ground level so you'd hear everyone who walked by.  Overall, the flat felt more like a hostel - which isn't the feel unusually go for using Airbnb, as hostels are cheaper. Location was great but given the fantastic transportion options, you can get a place a little further out and both nicer and cheaper."
846747,"Toetsie's place was very close to the tram and only 20 minutes to the city center.  The neighborhood is pretty calm and quiet, but has quite a few shops around including coffee shops.<br/>The room was nice and suited our needs.  It was nice to arrive at her place and have some snacks awaiting us on the bed.  We were also able to use the kitchenette to make some meals and the coffee machine was really nice to have.<br/>Toetsie was very helpful with information on the city and advice.  Overall it was a nice stay."
854161,"We rented this apartment for visiting family, and they found it clean, cozy, and well-located.  It's got a lot of character as well, and feels like a real, lived-in apartment that's full of character rather than a sterile hotel room."
866341,"Our stay in Wouter's house was great. The place is really nice and fully furnished. The rooftop view is amaizing. The neighborhood is nice and quiet and offers everything you need (grocery shops, coffees, restaurents, etc.). There are trams and bus stations all around the block and one just in front of the house. And most of all Wouter was very welcoming, helpfull and available all the time.<br/>I really recommend his apartment :)"
871358,"If you are looking for a real quiet place not far from the main attractions of the city, STOP! it is what are u looking for. <br/>And especial thanks for Matthijs and Francina for their welcoming message. It was so pleasant to read it in front of our door. And, of course, i want to thank u for our breakfast in such an amazing cafe with smell of fresh bread and warm of the traditional Dutch kitchen. "
877308,"Minha hospedagem foi perfeita. Petra é uma anfitriã maravilhosa, atenciosa e muito amigável. O espaço é impecável, lindo, charmoso, de extremo bom gosto. O bairro é ótimo e a localização também. Uma ótima opção para quem vai para Amsterdam. Super recomendo."
889157,"Was für perfekte Gastgeber! So freundlich und nett, besser geht gar nicht. Auch wenn ich nur kurz da war habe ich viel von der Gastfreundschaft erlebt. Das Gartenhäuschen liegt sehr idyllisch und ruhig und ist perfekt ausgestattet. Jetzt im Herbst ist es ein bisschen kühl aber der Heizer und die dicke Decke haben das vergessen lassen. Ein perfekter Aufenthalt."
902903,"Debbi is a great host, she's very pleasant and gave us s lot of good advice on where to go, things to see, etc. The studio is indeed a gem, perfect for a romantic weekend. The Food Halle, just minutes away, is a must-visit. I fully recommend Debbi's place and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again. Lovely."
914090,"Sarah-Jane's apartment is the best! Great location in a beautiful quiet street in the nicest area of Amsterdam, Jordaan. Apartment has all the things you might need, even soaps and creams for you yo use! Very clean and cosy. Suitable for 2-4 people. We were two friends and did not want to sleep in the large bed together, so Sarah set us a second very comfortable bed in the living room sofa bed. She is a very kind host, interesting personality who will do everything so that you would feel at home. Thank you Sarah, we had wonderful time in your place. Hope to see you soon again :)"
915541,"Manon's house is just as described. It is accessible to both the city and the country by bike or bus. And it is easily walkable or bikeable to parks and playgrounds. It is a great house for families with children and Manon and Claudio were very friends and easy to communicate with. For a blend of family-friendly, accessible, and value, I would highly recommend their home!"
921540,"Staying with Jeroen showed us once again what Air BnB is all about: We visited a city we've never been to before and instantly felt at home. Starting with the first message, Jeroen was very friendly and helpful. Once we arrived he took the time to share his favorite spots with us - restaurants, bars, parks, ... we most probably wouldn't have discovered without him (ask him about the Moroccan fish place - incredible!). The room was really cosy (and a bit hard to leave because of the pin-ball machine ;) and the neighbourhood is just great. If you visit Amsterdam without seeing the North you really miss out on something.<br/>Jeroen, thank you so much for everything."
922478,"What an enchanting and restorative experience it was to stay in the cottage in the garden of Marga's houseboat.  The cottage was cozy and charming,  transporting me back to my grandmas cottage in Ireland.  Staying on the Amstel River was delightful,  but list of all Marga and family made the stay an absolute comfort,  they were kind,  helpful and welcoming.  Marga picked us up from the airport,  we rented bikes and had dinner there for a small fee,  making it a memorable and warm experience.  A huge and unforgettable bonus was the special treat was doing an energy reading/ session with Marga.  As a therapist and healer myself I have received many healing session but my experience with Marga was one of the most positive and revitalizing I've had,  if interested in these sorts of things,  I recommend inquiring with her.  Highly Recommend.  Thank you Marga and Rico and fam!  Xo "
926138,The appartment and the hood were very cool... It was a great time in Amsterdam... Mike is very helpfull and kind.... Everything was fantastic... We will come back!!!
943578,"Great location! Excellent host, Heinz recieved us delicatelly and explained us what to visit and to do. Great appt, the room was clean and cozy. We totally  recommend it!!"
951661,"We stayed for an extended weekend at Daniel's fantastic apartment. The roof terrace was amazing, good bedrooms, and perfectly arranged living area w well equipped kitchen. "
956379,"I second all the good things from the other reviewers - fruit, eggs and more in the fridge, great looking place, bikes available, comfortable furniture and beds, etc. The neighborhood has a local feel without many tourists (in early December) even though it has Albertcuyp Market and is a short walk to the museums. There is a great international food store on the corner where you can get prepared foods for take out as well as things like spices (I'd been looking all over Europe for zaatar) and fresh curry leaves. Also found a nice Ethiopian restaurant in the area.  The radiant floor heating was nice but couldn't quite overcome a draft through the doors so it was not as cozy as it could've been. The strong and hot shower helped though.  Ester and her husband were very nice and responsive. Overall, great hosts and a great place."
960416,"I had a lovely time in Amsterdam staying at the Vondelpark B&B with Petra and Jerry. They were both very welcoming and Petra was very attentive, but not at all intrusive, and it was nice chatting with her. The room is really lovely, light, quiet and spacious with a table and chairs set at the bay window with a view to the street. I had breakfast here most mornings as well as a cooked breakfast upstairs in the dining room. The food was delicious and plentiful and beautifully presented and Petra even left a lovely note with my breakfast when I had it in my room. The ensuite is lovely too with beautiful tiles and new fittings and there is a guest kitchen to make tea/coffee in which also has a microwave and stove. The B&B is in a good location, away from the crowded tourist centre, only a 20 min walk in, a 5 min tram ride (stop is literally 1 min walk away), and next to Vondelpark which is lovely to walk around especially on a sunday evening when everyone is out and about. There are plenty of cafes and restaurants on the nearby Overtoom road and around the area which have a more local vibe if that appeals. There's also one across the road from the B&B which had great food. I would seek to stay here again if I had the chance to return to Amsterdam. I can highly recommend staying here and wish Petra all the best in her new business running the B&B."
962048,Our stay in Amsterdam was for a night... We had to early check-in and our host allowed us to do that..thanks for that<br/>Couple of things to note was there is no kitchen facilities neither there were any vessels...so heating is an hassle as well...Also we share the bathroom with the host so we have to maintain certain timings as well<br/>Overall the room was very small for 3 people..but the location was good..<br/>I would recommend only for 2 people with very less luggage..<br/>Overall a nice cozy flat and can give it a try
966874,"Gerald was a wonderful helpful host! He was available to answer all questions at all times. The flat is directly on the beautiful Prinsengracht. The view is beautiful as you watch the canal boats passing. I give my highest recommendation for this apartment and my hosts. The apartment is located in the best area of Amsterdam: quaint, full of restaurants and shops. The place is very clean and tidy with all the necessary amenities. my only regret is that I could not stay longer. Thank you, Gerald, for a lovely accommodation! I was so impressed by my host and the apartment, i rented it again for a month. It was lovely and in the perfect neighborhood (the Jordaan). My host was always available fir questions and requests. My highest recommendation! Location on the canal is lively and great fun as you sit outside and watch the fun in the canal. Superb!"
971539,"Beautiful location - disappointing service! The apartment is a spacious apartment, in a great location but was unfortunately not ready for us despite our accepting an arrangement of later arrival. We waited in the apartment while a friend of the person we were coordinating with cleaned the dishes and vacuumed the bedroom. This was not the reception we were expecting and made us a little concerned regarding the cleanliness of the rest of the apartment - thankfully not a problem! We also had no idea we were meeting with someone other than Caroline. There was poor effort re welcoming us to the apartment or Amsterdam - medium effort on house info and no attempt to leave any tourist information regarding Amsterdam - this itself is not expected, but would have been a nice touch. Lastly, the photographs suggest the apartment are a little better than what you see - if you're looking for ideal location and are not too fussy regarding the accommodation, this is perfect, simple accommodation but do not expect more. We ended up having a lovely time due to the location, and spacious living area, but it would have been a perfect stay if it had just started better "
988450,"La casa si trova in una zona tranquilla, vicino al centro della città e a 5 min a piedi dalla stazione. <br/>La casa è su 3 livelli, molto accogliente e dotata di una bella cucina e salone vivibile.<br/>C'è anche una bellissima terrazza e due balconi grandi.<br/>Le camere da letto sono abbastanza accoglienti, mentre i bagni un po' meno funzionali. <br/>Il riscaldamento era difficile da capire, quindi non riuscivamo a riscaldare la casa a nostro piacere.<br/>Là proprietaria di casa, però, è stata molto carina, ci ha fatto trovare dolci, vino e tessere per i musei; anche i vicini che ci hanno accolto sono stati molto carini. <br/>Tutto sommato una casa ottima per un gruppo di 7/8 persone! <br/>"
992497,"It was our first experience with airbnb and Mirjam was such a lovely host. The room is exactly as on the picture and description, her breakfast probably has been the best one of any other when I was on vacation (normally we never have breakfast, but after this one, I'm really thinking about introducing it into my daily routine - I love dutch Bread/Toast! )<br/>Besides everything was tidied up and we even had a refrigerator and waterboiler in our room to have some tea or coffee :)<br/>So all in all, everything was just perfect and we definetely recommend her place :)<br/><br/>Thanks for everything, Mirjam!"
1097486,"Ci siamo trovati bene. Posto molto tranquillo e silenzioso, carino ed essenziale. Stephanie & Sebastian sono molto discreti, disponibili tempestivamente per qualsiasi necessità. La camera è essenziale ed ha tutto quello che serve per una breve permanenza. La cucina fornisce solo un fornetto a microonde con cui ci si può preparare un pasto o riscaldare il latte per la colazione la mattina. La posizione è buona. Si arriva in centro città in poco tempo avendo a disposizione la fermata del tram proprio di fronte. Ci sono anche dei collegamenti vicini per la stazione Amstel. Nei dintorni si trovano anche un supermercato ed una lavanderia."
1110254,"Ingo was an excellent host, he was waiting for us and received us with some cookies and champagne. <br/>The apartment is great, even more then the pictures show. You have everything you need and more. The apartment is in a great location, you can go everywhere walking. The tram is a few blocks away, so you can go everywhere you want.<br/>I would definitely recommend it to your stay in Amsterdam!"
1117988,"Sebastian spent some time and effort to give us good overview and some tips about Amsterdam.<br/>Flat is well suited for short visit. Nice view and very good location - away from noisy and stressful centre but easy to get to all attractions. <br/>Overall, good alternative to the hotel - very private, affordable, cute and well placed for tourists.<br/>"
1119417,"when we arrive at the room there was the girl who cleans. we left our suitcases there and come back at 3. when we come back again the girl is not there. she left clothes inside the washing maschine (and we cant use it ), the floor was dirty, the bidet was dirty and we clean it ourselves and the worst of all is that mysteriously were lost 100 euro inside of our suitcase. its a pity because the appartment was really nice and spacefull"
1129579,Everything was accurate and it's even nicer than the pictures! The house boat was perfect! Hanneke was in contact instantaneously and we got to meet in person which added to feeling at home. We already knew the area but the boat was filled with magazines and suggestions of fun things to do. We went to the Mexican place on the corner on reccomenation and ended up chatting with the lovely bar staff all night. I would 100% stay again!  Thank you Hanneke xx 
1129829,"We had a perfect stay at Matthijs & Francina's loft room. We were reminded that Amsterdam's housing is mostly vertical. Thank goodness Francina offered to carry this old gal's luggage up the winding stairs and Matthijs carried it down!<br/>Their place is in the city center and an easy walk from Central Station. There are  abundant food & cocktail options in the neighborhood. We loved our daily walk  along the canal for breakfast. Our hosts gave us  breakfast vouchers for each day at the ""Last Crumb""....delicious!<br/>For us, this ""airbnb"" was great for recovering from our overseas jet-lag and preparing for an 8 day bike and barge trip out of Amsterdam."
1143888,"Kiek was accommodating and easy to communicate with. She even left wine for us and nice snacks. Their home really is in a truly perfect spot, far from the crowds in the Center and yet, still in the best part of Amsterdam!  Grab it if it's available!  However, if you are tall people (over 5'8""), you might not be so happy... we are short people and were thrilled."
1158616,"Marga and Rico were very hospitable hosts. They communicated easily, picked me from and to the train station and were happy to offer breakfast as well. The cabin is very cute, located in a very green and quiet part of Amsterdam. I had a very relaxing stay and recommend it highly. "
1185919,"Our stay in Henriettes Appartment in Amsterdam was great. She and her boyfriend were very friendly and caring and helpful. They made us feel very comfortable. The room was like on the fotos, large and cosy and very clean. So all in all, there is nothing to complain about. Only people who have a light sleep might have trouble sleeping, because it can be quite noisy (neighbours, airplanes & Co.)<br/>But for us, it was just perfect so I can definitely reccomend to stay there!!"
1192941,"Anneke was a wonderful hostess. From little snacks and cold drinks to a lovely breakfast, she took excellent care of us. We had drinks on the deck of the houseboat and watched the parade of boats pass by. The location was perfect, maybe 15 or 20 minute walk to the central station, and the trolley could drop of us off, or pick us up every 10 mins or so. The neighborhood was clean, quite and safe, and there were places near by for drinks or food. The houseboat was clean, beautifully decorated with a nice big bathroom, shower and tub. We recommend staying here.<br/>"
1202804,"Margot was very sweet and met us right at the apartment. (She lives upstairs which is great!)   The apartment is exactly as she describes and suited our needs very well.  The bed was perfectly comfortable.  We did look for an extra blanket but did not find one.  You may wish to ask her about that if you stay on colder nights.  Hot water was plentiful. The food she provided was so awesome!  We took advantage of nearly every offering she had there.  Coffee, tea, home made jam and delicious cheese.  Oh, and those dang waffle cookies were amazing. Yes, we were little piggies and ate every single one.  The only 'issue' we encountered was a bit of noise.  Margot's front door is connected to the AirBnB apartment and you will hear the sound of footsteps coming down the stairs and exiting/entering the front door.  Footsteps above are also heard.  As for external noise, you will hear the sound of music lessons from the music teacher who is a neighbor. This can be nice, like when we heard a choir singing! But we also heard 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star' played by 8 year olds on violin over, and over and over.  But that was just on one occasion and really quite comical.  Don't let this deter you from renting her space.  I just wanted future guests to know of this.  All in all, the stay was just great. Good location and easy walking distance to the train station.  Our favorite part of our stay was grabbing two chairs and sitting outside of the French doors and enjoying a glass of wine.  Thank you, Margot!   "
1209168,"   This is a great apartment. My wife and I took a three week trip through Amsterdam, Paris and Nice. This was the high light of our trip. The apartment itself is well appointed and in a great location. The pictures are a great representation. I would highly recommend staying hear for anyone planning a visit to Amsterdam. Thank you Ingo."
1215429,"Great location and neighbourhood, and a very comfortable and well presented house. The balcony out the back is a great place to sit back and relax, and the cleverly hidden bedroom sits out of the way of the main lounge, dining, kitchen area.<br/><br/>Frank was very responsive, met at the apartment with keys, and then left us to do our own thing. A helpful list of places in the area has also been prepared. A bike hire shop is less than a 5 minute walk around the corner.<br/><br/>Well recommended for a stay in Amsterdam!"
1224360,"Wendy was incredibly nice!! She was so genuinely welcoming and friendly! As soon as I arrived, Wendy offered me a drink and we started chatting about all the good places to eat in Amsterdam, and I could almost forget that we'd only just met! She had lots of great tips for me and my boyfriend, and was very thoughtful and considerate in everything she had prepared for our stay!  We even had surprise chocolates waiting for us by the bed and cheese in the fridge, what a treat! :)<br/><br/>The flat itself is so lovely, just like the description, and in a great location! It's on a very quiet street, steps from a canal, and you've got lots going on just a few streets over.  We really enjoyed wandering around the Albert Cuyp Straat, not so much for the market, but just for the neighbourhood itself full of shops, cafes, bars, and interesting people!<br/><br/>There's not much more I can say other than that we had an incredible time staying in Wendy's flat and anyone would be lucky to have the chance to meet Wendy and stay here!"
1233458,"Although I didn't get to meet Xiong (he was away on business) he communicated very well and I always felt up to date with what I needed to know. Reina (who is one of Xiong's neighbours) gave me the key and showed/explained everything to me very clearly. The place was very clean, the bed was comfortable and I slept well. Location for me (because I was with my car) was also very good and only 15mins into the centre. The ONLY thing I could say is that I appreciate completely that through Airbnb it is not a hotel and that you should treat it as if you would expect someone to treat your house. Having said that, by using Airbnb the prices are often similar to hotel rates so it's also your choice to do it to make an income, so there needs to be a bit of a balance. I feel Xiong was perhaps a bit too tight with some rules (perhaps has had bad experiences in the past) particularly with the usage of an iron/ironing board. Anyone travelling for business will need to neaten their clothes and to say, it's my house not a hotel, how many homes do not have an iron/ironing board? Anyway, that is the only negative so if you are just looking for a quiet, clean place to relax and visit Amsterdam, especially if you are with the car, I can fully recommend this place and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again! Thanks for a great stay!"
1243878,"Eva's apartment was perfect for our weekend stay in Amsterdam. Eva was very helpful with directions and gave us a few helpful hints on where to find great cafe's and places to visit. It was also very nice of her to allow us to leave our luggage in the apartment for the afternoon before our evening flight home. The apartment is in a great location! Very nice and quiet, on a pretty canal and there are cafe's and supermarket just down the road. The apartment is in a great location and it's easy to get around the city from there. "
1252451,"The apartment is absolutely lovely the rooms are spacious and luminous , it is very well placed near Amsterdam cetraal very near the center of the city we did not have to take any transportation during our stay , as for the hosts they were very lovely and nice they even left us Dutch goodies which we appreciated greatly only down side is the lack of fire in the kitchen which on a tight budget meant we didn't get to eat much. hôte  très  accueillant  et arrangeant"
1261635,"My family stayed in Amsterdam in Karin's family house. She is a very welcoming host and everything went seamlessly. Highlights of the house: very clean, beautifully decorated, wonderful front porch, close to trams and metro and nicely decorated living room, the kitchen was well stocked the bathroom was clean and we really felt at home. We can only recommend this place if you want to stay in Amsterdam."
1269847,"Nice and modern house, we (6 of us) stayed 4 nights and absolutely enjoyed our stay. beautiful backyard with access to small canals. Highly recommend this house. Thanks Inger and Rosa."
1283710,"We stayed at Mike's apartment for 4 night and it was definitely our best Airbnb experience !<br/>The apartment is as described and even better ! The place was very clean, cosy and very well located.<br/>Not to mention the beautiful decoration, arts on the wall and many other details that make all the difference.<br/>There is a very nice parc in front and the neighborhood is very charming with lots of good restaurants, cafes, grocery stores… well, basically everything you need to feel like home.<br/>We had a warm welcome from Mike and he was always present and very attentive to our needs and questions. He also recommended us few shops around, which was very helpful when we arrived.<br/>I will definitely comeback without any hesitation! Hope to see you soon Mike and thank you so much for everything !"
1290265,It was a really amazing experience in Amsterdam with a good host! David has been very kind with us. we council David as host!
1303344,"What a lovely apartment. We didn't know it was going to be this surprisingly cute and dainty. And very well-located. Nicolet is the most charming host we've had on AirBnB; welcoming,  cordial, and she left us a bottle of Prosecco for our honeymoon. This morning as one of the most beautiful houses we've ever stayed in. The description was extremely accurate, and the house was as spacious as the photos. <br/>Although you're near everything you want to see and do, it's a very quiet neighborhood. <br/>Joris was a great host and kept checking up on us regularly, making sure we're doing well and enjoying our time in the country. <br/>We would love to stay here again and again."
1341078,Beautiful apartment in a nice neighborhood! Would definitely stay there again!
1350627,"We totally recommend to stay at Davids place!<br/>We had a wonderful time in Amsterdam and Davids apartment was a perfect stay. It's beautiful and quiet although it's located in the middle of almost everything. The room is super neat and tidy and in the bathroom shampoo, towels and shower gel is provided. You can even leave your hair dryer at home. <br/>I met David only for a few moments, but everything was perfectly organized. Having breakfast at the room is a great opportunity, a waterkettle is provided in the room which comes really handy. If you can go with instant coffee you'll be fine - otherwise it would be wise to check out a good take away coffee in the area. But there are plenty... "
1360691,"Joris' house was fabulous. Very well equipped kitchen (which made all the difference since we did all our own cooking), clean and comfortable, excellent location etc. It was everything as advertised and more. We would most definitely recommend! Thanks Joris!"
1367536,"Toetsie is such a warm, friendly, and lovely host, and I felt instantly welcomed when I arrived. Her home is lovely, and lovingly decorated, and my room was very comfortable. Toetsie had left a few snacks for me (juice, wine, bread and milk) although since I was only staying for one night, I didn't partake, and rushed off the next morning - but it was very thoughtful and much appreciated. I hope to stay with Toetsie again, and I recommend her place! She's a gem!"
1398012,"The Brouwersgracht has been named 'the most beautiful canal in Amsterdam.  Barbara's classic Amsterdam home is situated on the most beautiful part of the canal, just off the Prinzengracht.  Her home is as clean as one  would expect in a Dutch home.   She gladly met all of our requests. The experience could not have been better."
1404198,"Lucas was very responsive from my first inquiry. He provided answers to all my questions and he and the apartment manager were very flexible about check-in time. Lucas went above and beyond by providing a baby crib and bringing extra window coverings during our stay. The location is perfect, outside of busy tourist zone but near many cafes, bars, restaurants, and shops. Small inconveniences, such as few towels and no outlets in the bathroom did not prevent us from having a great stay."
1420918,"David was very nice and welcoming. He's been very accommodating regarding my time of arrival. <br/>The place is spotless and very well located in the city. <br/>All in all, it's been a pleasure staying at David's place. I highly recommend it !"
1443278,"Coen was a fantastic communicator right from the start. Always answering any questions straight away - which is really important when trying to make o/seas bookings. The house is in a great location with trams literally outside the door (10 minutes to the Dam - central city). Bus close by - 10 minutes to the central station. Very handy. The neighbourhood is excellent: a good supermarket very close by, a few small restaurants close by - bar across the road, wonderful huge playground & animal park close by.  the house has a great living area - lovely workable stainless steel kitchen & lovely sunny courtyard. Bedrooms & bathroom on 1st floor are good. We used the bedroom downstairs too, which was v comfortable. Staircase nicely carpeted. The House is as described on the website. The house is light & airy & we had the most wonderful time there for 11 nights. We would all highly recommend staying here."
1460613,"S was a really friendly host! Our flight was delayed, and she was very helpful to make sure that we could get into the apartment regardless of the inconvenience it would cause her without any hint of annoyance. She made sure that we had a comfortable stay and gave us some great suggestions on where to visit and eat. We had the best apple tarts in Amsterdam from her suggestion! Her cat is beautiful and was just as welcoming as the host herself :) The location of the apartment was convenient with tram/bikes to the airport or the city centre. It's also got very friendly and cosy pubs, cafes and restaurants around it. We enjoyed our stay very much, and was very happy to have met S! :)"
1481229,"The houseboat really exceeded our expectations, we had a really comfortable and relaxed stay. Annemiek and Bauke could not have been more kind and helpful, from leaving some food and wine to helping with the local purchase of a saxophone case. Also so lovely to wake up in the morning to see a duck gliding past the window -if they ever leave here I will be first in the queue to move in! Will hopefully return sooner rather than later as plenty more to do and see in Amsterdam."
1485530,"Martine had snacks and a bottle of wine and a lovely note waiting for us. Julia let us in early which was a bonus for a weary traveller. The house is perfect for a family with early- mid age children. The original 1918 period details in the home have been preserved which added character to the experience. The basement level (kitchen ,dining and full bath/ walk in glass enclosure shower and walk out to back garden seating area were a highlight. The bikes -4 working out of six were great to explore the city like a local. Just be mindful the ferry stops at 12midnight if you are planning to get home after that you need to take another ferry and very small footbridge- just ask the locals for directions- they are very helpful.<br/>Getting a day pass for the gvb is great for traveling around the city by public transport. <br/>Our stay at Martine's was memorable, especially with all four cats - who just want to be with you all the time- quite endearing if you are a cat enthusiast!!!<br/> Beautiful period home with lovely personal decor- very large comfortable space to relax in."
1487516,"Estupendo alojamiento en el Jordaan.  El apartamento es muy confortable y acogedor y está decorado con mucho gusto. Cuenta con todo lo necesario para que la estancia sea lo más agradable posible. La cámada es tremendamente cómoda y se duerme sin ningún ruido. El barrio está en el centro, a 15 minutos andando de la plaza Dam, a 7 de la casa de Anna Frank y a 20 de la estación central. El proceso de check in se llevó a cabo sin ningún problema aunque nuestro avión llegó con retraso.  Si vuelvo a Ámsterdam, intentaré alojarme otra vez aquí sin ninguna duda."
1500453,"Very luxurious space! We usually only rent entire apartments, but this private room was so large, bright, and airy, it felt like an apartment. The bed was super comfy - note that there's two of them side by side, instead of one very large mattress - and there's also both down and synthetic pillows. It was always warm and cozy, despite the cold weather outside! We loved the location as well - close to central (but not in the center) and right next to the very awesome neighborhood of Jordaan. Do it! You'd love this place."
1515338,Host was responsive. Room was clean. Location is great! I recommend it if you are seeking a safe haven away from Amsterdam's nightlife. 
1545313,"The room was very large and comfortable, full of interesting books and art. Well located right by a bus stop taking you downtown and a grocery. Jeroen was also very helpful in providing suggestions of what to see. Great stay overall!"
1546482,I has a wonderful stay at Frits' apartment! He was extremely responsive and helpful if I ever needed anything. The apartment was clean and in a great location with tons of restaurant and shops nearby.
1552148,"Perfect located accommodation in the centre of Amsterdam. Everything is good to reach, lots of shops and nice bars and restaurants are in the area. The tram stops close to the house which is very convenient when you come from Centraal Station.<br/>The room is as lovely and clean as shown on the pictures with a balcony and a spacious bathroom.<br/>Wendie and Hans are really nice hosts who gave a lot of recommendations and were always there for a little chat. They also surprised us with peaches and muffins.<br/>Thank you for the great stay, Wendie and Hans! We hope to see you again one day!"
1562264,Joris house was the perfect home for my family christmas. The place is clean and welcoming as well as perfectly situated in a quiet but very central Amsterdam street. The open fire was super 'Gezellig' for the holidays. Couldnt' recommend enough.  
1574203,"An excellent place, just perfect. Right on the canal with the ducks outside the window. Very clean room, super comfortable bed! One of the best places I've stayed. Thanks Simon!"
1575196,"Toetsie is an amazing person. It was a delight to stay at her place. She has a beautiful home, with a lot of art, next to the Oosterpark, in a nice neighborhood. The view from the roof is very nice. After my arrival she updated my room, I got a bigger room with a king size bed and had a private bathroom, which was really cool. She also offered me fruit juice, wine and breakfast - she just made me feel at home. It was interesting to talk with her not only about Amsterdam but also about life.<br/>Unfortunately I got sick during my stay. She was very nice, she took care of me and brought me tea and drugs. <br/>I felt very comfortable and would stay again with her and her cat Rocky. I wish her all the best and hope to welcome her in Switzerland."

1581254,"Yahav was very helpful in providing information on things to do and places to visit in Amsterdam. The list of cafes, restaurants and attractions they've made was very solid and took you to a lot of great parts of the city you might not visit otherwise. <br/><br/>Also, having a bike to use was incredibly convenient. While traveling Europe, the time saved from not having to seek out a bike rental and having to return it to a certain spot, etc was great. Coming from someone who bikes very frequently back home, the bike could use a tune-up,  but whatever. It worked fine, and got me around the city safely. That being said, Yahav was wonderful in ensuring that the bike fit me well and that I was able to ride it safely!<br/><br/>My only grievance is that the price had changed when I booked. I wasn't aware that rates could change based on the host's discretion. It's fine as I booked very last minute and he raised the price since it was less convenient, but I may have went with another location that was cheaper otherwise. <br/><br/>Overall though, Yahav and Diedre are wonderful hosts and very much recommended. "
1591196,"Great experience! <br/>Toetsie is very kind, she gave me and my friend the house keys and she let us use heir house in a very trustful way. <br/>When we arrived we found bread, clean towels, a bottle of wine and juice on the bed. In the fridge there were others things we could use, like eggs, milk, marmalades.<br/>The house was clean and quite near to the centre. Metro,tram and bus are near and you can also reach the centre in 20minutes walking.<br/>Then Rocky, the cat, is very cute and loving!"
1595773,"Watch out - they try to charge you extra on arrival in case you come in late. Apart from that, best Location to stay. Apartment has everything you Need. Enjoy typical Amsterdam lifestyle. "
1606029,"My most pleasant trip to Amsterdam so far. <br/>Eva prepared a breakfast for our early morning arrival. She was very kind and helpful.<br/>The house is couple of minutes away from a supermarket and tram station. Many nice cafes, restaurant and bars around. And it was on a walking distance to the main attractions. <br/>The house was extremely clean, comfortable and had fully equipped kitchen. I wish the weather was much better so we could have enjoyed the balconies more :)<br/>Thanks a lot for everything again!<br/>Hulya<br/><br/>"
1639365,"Heleen's place was great!  <br/>We stayed with our two year old, who slept in the smaller bedroom, and our 4 month old, who slept in the big room with us in the crib Heleen provided.  During the summer, I recommend bringing an eye mask for the person staying in the smaller bedroom as the daylight lasts a long time and the curtains in that room are not as dark as the larger room's.<br/>Heleen's son welcomed us and helped us figure out good places to eat and even offered babysitting availability should the timing work out.  Our kids turned out to be too jet lagged for us to want to foist them on anyone else so we didn't take him up on the offer.<br/>The location of the apartment was great, just one block to tram and bus stops.  There were several affordable grocery stores and plenty of tasty restaurants right nearby.<br/>As with all old buildings in Amsterdam, there is no elevator and the stairs up to the apartment are quite steep, but the railings were sturdy and I didn't feel concerned even carrying our baby.  There was a place on the landing below to leave our stroller so we didn't need to cart it all the way up."
1641902,"Ella’s place was a warm bright, comfortable and well equipped environment with some minor exceptions. The apartment is in a great location and communication with the host’s representative was excellent. The representative was there to meet us when we arrived and was very professional, provided a tour, information and answered any questions we had.  A problem with the internet connection (not the fault of the owner) was solved aggressively and quickly with progress updates at regular intervals from our contact. The apartment is located in a vibrant area with many shops, cafes, restaurants and bars within blocks. Several key attractions are within easy walking distance including major museums. (note that several museums including the Van Gogh and the Stedelijk do not accept the museum pass provided). Access to public transportation is great with a tram stop located just a 2 or 3 minute walk from the apartment. The Albert Cuyp open air market is just around the corner. Despite being in a vibrant, busy area, on the ground floor and fronting the street it is relatively quiet during the day and very quiet in the evening and at night. I would not hesitate recommending this apartment to anyone looking for a pleasant, quiet, well located apartment for their Amsterdam stay. I would rate this apartment in the 4 to 5 star category except for the following.<br/>There were two safety issues the owner was made aware of and promised to correct but were not accomplished before we left. Before booking potential guests should insure that the owner has resolved the two issues which, while creating a minor inconvenience, could be potential safety hazards. Gas stove controls can inadvertently be set to the off position in a way that gas continues to be supplied with no flame present an obvious hazard. The bathroom lights go off consistently after about 30 to 40 minutes. This most likely is the result of fixture overheating being resolved by a thermal protection switch on the lights. This condition can indicate a potential fire hazard and should be addressed. <br/>"
1653002,"I enjoyed my stay at Tootsie's. First and foremost, and as other reviewers have mentioned, Tootsie's thoughtfulness and warmth stands out. Tootsie made sure I knew exactly how to get to the apt and checked with me if it was ok that she wasn't home when I arrived. When she learned that I liked street markets she made a list of options for me. She lent me her bike for several days which made my trip so much more fun. The kitchenette and fridge on the guests' floor is well stocked with breakfast goodies, a espresso machine included, and on top of that there was a complimentary bottle of wine waiting for me upon arrival. Thank you! Even though the small bathroom, kitchenette and sitting room area shared with the other 2 guests were right near my bedroom I could rest well and it never felt too crowded. The apt. is in a quaint residential area not too far from the historical center of the city. Reaching the main attractions by bike was easy and perhaps even walking is an option, beyond the several trams around. Recommended! "
1691672,"Rosie and her husband Matt are very hospitable and friendly folks. Rosie was kind enough to let me stay one night even though there is a two night minimum. I had a work conference the next day and was transitioning to my work hotel. <br/><br/>I felt comfortable asking them questions about sightseeing. They provided very detailed responses. The description and pictures of the room are accurate."
1702517,Simone is absolutely fab! A host with amazing personality  and very nice flat to boost. She's ever so helpful with recommendations on where to go/what to see and very adaptable to our change of plans. It's a shame that we didnt have enough time this trip to organise a personal shopping experience with her. We'll definitely be back!

1721292,"Great place and lovely company. Corina was the most welcoming host imaginable, and the location could not be better (as the name implies!) <br/>We would definitely stay here again next time we are in Amsterdam. <br/>Strongly recommended! <br/>"
1731807,"Lieu idéal pour découvrir Amsterdam et ses musées. Rosie est une hôte chaleureuse, à l'écoute de ses invités (confort, bonnes adresses, trucs et astuces, ...).<br/>Appartement situé dans un quartier très calme à proximité du centre avec deux chambres privées à l'étage avec salle de bain et toilette en commun. Nous avons séjourné dans une chambre double spacieuse et très lumineuse.<br/>Merci pour ce séjour"
1738103,"The studio itself was cute and homely about 15 minutes away from the main bars and restaurants and was just what we were looking for. We didn't spend much time in there as we were only in Amsterdam for 2 nights, but as a great value accommodation for a couple this was perfect."
1772186,"Evert's room on the Singel Canal was absolutely fantastic! The location is close to the Centraal Station, the Anne Frank house and dozens of restaurants and little shops. The room itself is incredibly beautiful, comfortable and extremely charming - I wish my own apartment was as lovely. Evert himself was very communicative and helpful. Overall a wonderful place to stay - I hope to stay again on my next trip to Amsterdam. "
1788190,Hands down one of the absolute best experiences you can have in Amsterdam.
1793002,Roel is a wonderful host. He greeted us and waited while our train was delayed. His flat is full of charm and character. My husband and I now have wonderful memories of listening to old records while sitting on his beautiful porch. The area is perfect and walking distance to everything important. The food around De Pijp is amazing. Will never forget our stay at Roel's :) 
1794000,"The house (especially the kitchen) is very  cozy.  The location is central, with many shops, bike rentals, restaurant etc near by. Near the red lights district. Our car could not fit in the tight parking space. Heidi was great.  "
1798294,"We spent a pleasant few days in the apartment.  We liked the location - a 20 minute walk from the central station, near Muntplein.  It was open and felt airy, even being half below street level.  The appliances all worked as expected, the water was hot, and we certainly appreciated the washer and dryer.  It was a treat to use a 5-burner gas stove, and the kitchen contained more than enough cutlery and plates.  It would benefit from the addition of both pans or skillets (to complement the 3 large pots) and also more cooking utensils than the plastic ladle, lettuce knife and small paring knives we found.  Nicolet was always quick to reply to emails with answers or suggestions; we unfortunately didn't have the opportunity to meet. We had a very nice stay here. It’s about a 20 minute walk from the central station and in the middle of a fairly calm, pleasant and green neighborhood, the Jordaan.  It was super clean, with good use made of the small space.  It was quiet (at least in the days before King’s day) and well-located near a ton of great restaurants, bars and small shops.  We enjoyed our time here and look forward to staying on our next visit."
1804273,"My sister and I enjoyed three very peaceful days here.  It is a beautiful and well appointed basement apartment.  There is a lot of light and it is spacious and comfortable.  The daily breakfast was delicious and a great start to the day.  So fresh and nourishing.  Laura and Arjan were so gracious to work with our schedule everyday.  We feel connected to everything with a comfortable walk to the station as well as tram and bus stations a couple blocks away.  This residential area is very peaceful and pleasant.  The historical building is just stunning and helps you feel a part of Amsterdam's past and tradition.  We also were grateful for the chance to arrange for rides to and from the airport.  That was a great value and big timesaver.  Both Laura and Arjan were very kind and friendly.  We very much enjoyed our interactions with them. Henry was so helpful, both with our check-in and finding a taxi at the end.  This is a small, but incredibly well-situated spot.  It was so clean and well appointed.  We loved the bed and the shower.  Having a little fridge was very helpful and Henry was so kind to keep it stocked with some drinks."
1817279,Ingo's apartment is beautiful and has a perfect location! Nothing to complaint about and would recomend it to friends and family!
1835714,"Hein's flat is the ultimate experience you can have in Amsterdam. The one bedroom flat is cosy, fully furnished, a 15 minute walk to the centre, and a stone's thrown away from the Metro. Hein himself is a fantastic host, ready to give you the best suggestions and place to visit along with a useful map. An experience definitely recommended to anyone! "
1843863,"This is our first AirBnb stay and we couldn't have been happier with Carolien's studio apartment. <br/><br/>We arrived in Amsterdam and our hotel was not as advertised so we decided to find another option. We were lucky enough to come across this listing. It is a very spacious, incredibly clean studio apartment. Large bed and tv with cable and wifi internet. Dining table, small kitchen area, microwave and fridge. Large bathroom with a tub and shower and a separate bathroom with a private toilet. <br/><br/>Carolien and her husband took the time to show us all the amenities of the apartment and even provided fresh fruit and drinks. They live downstairs and were available personally or by phone if we had any questions. It is located in great area, about a 5-10 minute walk from Leidseplein's main entertainment district. The area was very clean and safe.<br/><br/>When we return to Amsterdam, we won't think twice about staying with in Carolien's property and will recommend it to friends."
1843967,The location was perfect (really close to public transport and very walkable to the museum area) but at the same time nice and residential and in a nice neighborhood. The room was clean and quiet and a comfortable place to come home to and relax after exploring the city center!
1866596,Great place - would go back the next time I come to Amsterdam
1908065,"Barbara's stay in the house when you go to amsterdam is indeed the right choice. the house is fantastic, good location magnificent view of the canal.Excellent neighborhood and barbara is a very helpful.recommend 100%"

THE BED IS AMAZINGLY COMFORTABLE.<br/><br/>Matthijs is a very attentive and considerate host, flexible communicative and I can keep going. But im sure you get the point this is a great place to stay. I almost feel like keeping it a secret! "
1963645,"My husband and I spend 4 wonderful days in Amsterdam, and staying at Vibeke's place only made them better. Even before we arrived she was very pleasant & helpful through messages and even offered us a generous discount because of some construction work at the house next door. When we arrived she was very friendly and gave us a free map and helped us figure out the transportation system in the city and even gave us a few recommendations for things to do. The apartment is small and cozy but our room was quite spacious and looks exactly like the pictures. Overall, the place was very clean & comfortable, and Vibeke was mostly out or staying in her room, so we had no issue with our privacy, although we contacted her easily via Whatspp/phone whenever we needed. The apartment is located in a good neighborhood within walking distance to bus/tram stop & easily connects to the city center and the airport. There are also supermarkets, bakeries and cafes nearby. Overall, I would recommend Vibeke's place to anyone looking for an affordable, clean and cozy place to stay in Amsterdam and would definitely go back."
1970612,"We had a great time in Amsterdam.  The apartment itself was bright, clean and located in great location.  It was well equipped with full kitchen, a small fridge, TV, and all-important internet.  Although we only used the gas cooker once, we loved the flexibility of being able to eat at home.  <br/><br/>The big plus in our stay was Robert himself.  Robert was very considerate.  He spent time to explain where everything is and he put post it notes in several places where it may not be obvious (ex: light switch under the cabinet) and he was also very reachable during our stay.  Unfortunately it was cold and rainy in later half of our vacation but Robert sent us suggestions of indoor point of interests even before we thought about asking.  Thanks Robert! :-)<br/><br/>"
1978970,Heidi was an excellent host. Her house is full of soul and I have enjoyed my stay in it. Thank you Heidi!

2009092,"We had been traveling for 2 months and found BBBellamy to be one of the best Airbnb homes we'd found. The room is light and really comfortable. It is located in a great part of Amsterdam, close to the centre and right near a great market. Debby is a fantastic host who has thoughtfully prepared the room with everything you would like while traveling. We will definitely stay there next time we're in Amsterdam. Thanks Debby! "
2012232,"Our stay at Wendys apartment was perfect! <br/>The flat just looks like on the pictures, it is very cute, individuell and stylish. The location is realy great, because the street is quiet but just in a few steps you are in the middle of de Pijp with all the bars, cafés, restaurants, etc. For us, the Pijp itself seems to be the best quarter to live in Amsterdam (stylish, bohemian, urban, native/not so turistic,...). <br/>Wendy is a perfect host- friendly, warm, helpfull and communicative. She had a lot of good advices and we felt very comfortable at her home. <br/>All in all we highly recommend this place!"
2026969,"What an amazing apartment! Only bettered by Esther's friendliness. We stayed only one night but still had a truly wonderful time. The apartment is cosy and clean, the beds are amazing, wifi works perfectly... This place has everything you need.<br/><br/>Another special mention for Esther. We only chatted for about 5 minutes but she still managed to make us feel very welcome, giving us all the information we needed.<br/><br/>Thank you Esther, you will definitely see us again!"
2030020,"Hello Stephan your house is very beautiful, full of every comfort and useful accessories. I remained hours watching the rain from the view it offers your home in a very relaxing atmosphere. You have been very kind and helpful, I regret not having been able to talk to you in real time with you because of my English too narrow. the holiday despite the bad weather was ok.<br/>thank you again!"
2044810,Erik was an amazing guest. He waited for us as we arrived a little late and offered us some beers and conversation :) The studio is really confortable and the location is good for a short stay. Just a short walk to the ferry that leaves you right at the city centre. We had a really good time and hopefully we can come back to Amsterdam! 
2059930,"We had a fantastic stay in this lovely, light, comfortable apartment!  It was a perfect situation for our three kids, with toys, and even some obliging cats and a hamster to love.  The apartment is very close to the inner city, but in a wonderful neighbourhood a stone's throw from the gorgeous Vondelpark.  Brenda was very warm, helpful and generous.  We couldn't have been happier with our experience.  Highly recommended, especially for a family.  "
2087508,"Great flat, excellent location, lovely hosts! <br/>Rose accepted my ""last minute"" request and when I arrive there It was like to be at home.

The apartment is a lovely place to stay and a perfect location to visit the city. Rosie and Matt are very friendly people.

2201878,"As a group of 5 women we spent a wonderful week-end in Femke's unique and very inspirering appartement. The place is very spacious and beautiful with different pieces of art and pretty furniture. Also it is conveniently located with cosy restaurants, bars, a bike rental and a supermarket close by.<br/>Femke is a very warm-hearted person: she welcomed us with wine, cheese, buisquits and bread and she had put up fresh flowers all over the appartement, so we felt at home immediately.<br/>""Hopp"", the bunny is really sweet and relaxed, we all fell in love with him :)<br/>Thank you, Femke, for letting us stay at your place! We really loved being your guests!!!!<br/>"
2243660,"Rosie was a great host and has a fantastic apartment. The room was great, exactly as described and the bathroom has a great shower - always good after long days biking around town. The area was a beautiful place to stay; full of Amsterdam School architecture, quiet streets but close to bars / restaurants of De Pijp and the museum district. Quick and easy to get into town via tram or bike and the airport via south train station. Exactly what I was looking for and would certainly stay again... coffee and breakfast in the morning is another bonus! "
2263138,"The flat is nice with a reasonable room with all you need for a short break. A well equipped kitchen makes it easy to prepare meals.I think bicycles should be offered so that the visitors can get easily to Amsterdan town centre. These could be given free of charge on the basis of a deposit being put down at the beginning of the holiday. <br/>A television should offered in the room so that the clients can view programmes"
2284138,"Davids place was much better quality than any hotel we have stayed in in the centre of Amsterdam. Not a single complaint. Everything was clean and modern, Good Dutch/continental breakfast left at your room daily. This is the perfect location for Red Light area bars, restaurants and coffee shops and a great base for touring further away to Rembrant and Leidsplein areas etc. David is a great guy and we wouldn't hesitate reccommending his place to anyone. We will definitly stay at Davids again.<br/>Ron & Ann This is the 3rd time my wife and I have stayed at David's place. Really clean and comfortable. Very welcoming host and the place is handy for most places like the red light, Rembrant and Leids squares and Nieuimarket area.<br/>Nice continental breakfast.<br/>Thanks guys.<br/>Ron & Ann"
2284388,"We had a wonderful stay at Karin's Studio! Its perfectly located - really in the heart of amsterdam. The room is cozy and offers a confortable bed.

2295541,"Liza was a perfect host and her place was amazing. She welcomed us with an easter bunny made of chocolate and some tulip bulbs as presents on the dining table. She had thought every detail carefully and as I witnessed on the check out, she is designing all those details for individually for every new guest. The place was so bright which makes you feel very positive and energetic. It was also super clean. The decoration was quite modern and useful. The bed was so comfortable. I felt like I was experiencing the dutch lifestyle, more than a tourist on sightseeing. The location was PERFECT. It was one of the most elegant and famous canals of Amsterdam and every ""must see and do"" spot was walking distance away. It was my 3rd time in the city and I can honestly say that this time I had the best Amsterdam experience I've had by the help of Liza and her sweet friends. Don't even think twice before you write her. That place is DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED."
2302087,"We stayed one night at this lovely B&B. Rosie is a very nice host and the B&B is in one of the most beautiful and safe areas in Amsterdam, close to all the musea and nice bars and restaurants.<br/>Bed is perfect and breakfast was great. "
2321349,"Bon accueil par une amie d'Ineke. Le logement correspondait à la description. Décor chaleureux. Très propre. Un paquet de gaufre nous attendait sur la table de la salle à manger. Accès très facile au centre d'Amsterdam par le ferry (10' à pieds de la maison). Parking gratuit derrière la maison, ce qui n'est pas négligeable à Amsterdam où cela reste très cher et difficile. Supermarché à 5'. Une bonne adresse."
2329288,"Spacious room, traditional and very well cleaned in the heart of Amsterdam, within walking distance of attractions, restaurants and pubs.<br/>Mirjam was really very kind and gave us good tips for sightseeing.<br/>Fantastic and delicious breakfast.<br/>Only negative point is the heated of the house: practically absent in the bathroom.<br/>Overall positive experience, I recommend this house for a nice visit to the city"

The apartment is in a delightful location: an easy walk to all the attractions of central Amsterdam, yet feels pleasantly separate from the touristy bustle of a few streets away. If you want to be close to the sights but stay in a local inner-city neighborhood, this is the place. Mirjam is a lovely host, and I would strongly recommend her accommodation."
2375142,"Martijn's house is a very quick taxi ride from the airport and located on a peaceful street just off a main road and very close to a tram stop.<br/>On arrival Martijn was very welcoming, gave a quick tour of the property and left us some lovely gifts to enjoy. <br/>The house itself is very spacious and the garden is a great place to relax with a glass or two of wine.<br/>We especially appreciated the recommendations Martijn made to us, we tried almost all of them and had a great time at all, most are easy walking distance and with the tram being so close its easy to get to areas further afield.<br/>Whether you're a first time visitor to Amsterdam (as we were) or returning for another trip we'd definitely recommend this as a place to base yourselves."

2395433,"We had a lovely stay at Jan's houseboat. He is very welcoming and friendly-meeting us at the train station, getting us settled and bringing us to the grocery store.  The house is great and he made sure we had maps available, take out menus, info on Amsterdam, etc.  The house is in an excellent location; we walked into the city through one of the large parks. Also, it's strategic location is great for public transport, with the train, bus, metro and tram stations all within walking distance. There is a childrens park just on the corner as well. We would highly recommend Jan and his houseboat and hope we can stay again!  Very convenient location and friendly host! My kids enjoyed and the space was great for us.  He came and brought milk, bread and fresh fruits for us several times-which was lovely. We would stay again!"

The renovated WC is a worthy experience :) Thanks for the tasty breakfast and for being so helpful and flexible!"
2453242,This space was so fantastic and Miriam a wonderful host. There's an unprecedented amount of space here and our kids really appreciated the room to move around. I loved all the aesthetic touches. The area is nice and the local supermarket is fantastic. Easy to get public transport.
2453448,"Nous avons attendu à notre arrivée quelques heures, toutefois, le bateau était ouvert. Nous aurions du demander au préalable la situation exacte du bateau afin de ne pas chercher. Le LOTUS ne comporte que 8 chambres et non 9 comme indiqué dans l’annonce. Le minimum de produits de bienvenue comme sel, huile aurait été appréciable à notre arrivée. Le bateau ne ferme pas à clé, heureusement nous n’avons pas eu de visite indésirable … Malgré une coupure d’eau, une coupure de gaz et des toilettes bouchées, nous avons passé un bon séjour sur le Lotus car Olaf nous a dépanné sauf pour la WIFI qui ne fonctionne pas correctement. Le voilier est chauffé correctement.  Attention à ne pas abuser de la boisson en ville car pour revenir sur le voilier, il faut tout de même escalader deux autres voiliers. Cette ville est charmante et je conseille de prendre un abonnement pour les transports publics car il y a 30 à 40 minutes de marche pour atteindre le centre de la ville."
2525168,"It was an absolutely amazing experience that started with being picked up from the airport early morning, meeting a welcoming family, getting delicious breakfast and being surprised how friendly the hosts are and how smooth arriving is. Thank you so much for all the warmth, tips, cosy place, taking care, being always available and giving us this amazing experience of AirBnB and Amsterdam. We will be back for sure!"
2530559,We loved our stay!! Great convenient location although if you don't feel like having the Red Light District right in your face then it may not be the area for you ;) overall though it was a great place to stay!!
2535881,"Das Haus ist ideal für einen mehrtägigen Aufenthalt in Amsterdam, insbesondere für Gruppen. Die Küche ist zum Wohn-/Essbereich offen und damit sehr kommunikativ. Und sehr chic :-)<br/>Be careful with the stairs! Herzlichen Dank an Guido für die sehr freundliche Aufnahme und stete Kommunikationsbereitschaft. See you, Jörg"
2557668,"Me gustaron las fotos del altillo.<br/>Se ajustaban a lo que buscábamos.<br/>Un espacio pequeño pero confortable en esta ciudad de cuentos que es Amsterdam.<br/>El departamento tiene todo lo necesario, es hermoso con vista a la calle, sobre un canal.<br/>Las fotos se ajustan a la realidad, esta perfectamente limpio.<br/>La ubicación es excelente, íbamos caminando desde allí a todas partes<br/>Edith estuvo presente en todo momento, respondió rápido a cada mensaje, a cada inquietud que tuvimos.Nos dio la bienvenida aunque llegamos tarde en la noche y nos despidió como siempre muy amable y atenta. Un placer conocerla!<br/>Se mostró siempre solidaria a cada necesidad  que se presento.<br/>Muchas Gracias Edith!<br/>Sin duda volveremos!!!!<br/><br/>"
2566819,"We had an incredible time at Mike's apartment! Mike and his family are very friendly and welcoming, and went the extra mile to make us feel comfortable and at home. The space is very clean, modern,  stylish, and functional. We also appreciated the attention to detail for example with a stock of coffee, fruits, jam, and juices waiting for us on our arrival. The location is good, quiet, close to town, close to the airport, and close to the train station.  The communication was quick and effective - and they live in the building so you can get help at any time. <br/>Thank you for letting us stay, we hope to come again! This was by far our favourite apartment on our trip. Best of luck!"
2569676,"Place was great, nice little balcony. Love dapper markt! Lovely location for a short break. Great bed! And fantastic location. Interaction with host was great, recommended!"
2573699,"Great apartment in the great location. Leontine sent instructions in advance of our arrival on how to get to the apartment - couldn't have made getting there any easier. <br/><br/>While we didn't get to meet Leontine in person her friend let us in the apartment and collected the key when we left. They also gave us free macaroons while we waited for our Uber.<br/><br/>The apartment was spacious and the roof terrace was a bonus giving us perfect views of the city. Would def visit again."
2579342,"Rosie and her husband were lovely hosts. They made us feel welcome and helped us find interesting things to do in Amsterdam.<br/><br/>The room was very pleasant, clean and quiet (despite all the parties in Amsterdam at the time). I would stay here again."
2587926,Nathalie's home is super! One of the best I've ever Found! Very spacious and comfortable situated in a very good area! Totally Raccomanded! 
2588804,"I stayed at Toetsie's place for 2 nights while passing through Amsterdam. She was such a wonderful and helpful host - it felt like I was meeting up with an old friend! Her place is exactly as described and the area was perfect for me. She even left me a bottle of wine, fruit juice and bread and stocked the fridge with whatever I might need! I would definitely stay with her again. Really nice location, very comfortable stay. Easy communication with Marcel. My only note is that it would have been nice to have a kettle and a couple more hand towels. My husband and I will definite stay here again. Thank you!"
2622835,"Wytse was a perfect host - organized, clear and punctual. His home is beautiful, cozy and well-located. I highly recommend staying here. "
2638515,"La descripción del anuncio es exacta! La zona es excelente, cerca del centro y en una zona llena de bares y restaurantes.<br/><br/>Olaf es una excelente persona, desde un principio nos sentimos como en casa, muy cordial y muy amable, atento en todo momento,  manteniendo la privacidad.<br/>Sin duda lo recomiendo!"
2640100,"Amazing amazing apartment and amazing host! Perfect location, darling flat, and karlijn was so good to us, even greeting us with wine and Dutch cookies! We will absolutely return!"
2640161,"This place was amazing! Lots of space , quiet, and relaxing. Very conveniently located . 2 minute ferry ride to the train station . I will definitely stay again!"
2646949,"Robert and Anke's apartment provided the perfect ""home"" for our first visit to Amsterdam.  We would stay there again without hesitation.  The modern apartment has tons of light with big windows and nice views.  The flat is situated on a beautiful quiet street with a lovely balcony overlooking a quiet canal on one side of the apartment and picturesque views of the Westerkerk Tower on the other.  The apartment was extremely clean and the kitchen was very convenient for cooking dinner in the evenings.  We really appreciated Robert's thorough introduction complete with maps, suggestions of things to do and places to eat, and a walk to the nearby shopping street.  We were able to buy our groceries and local treats from the lovely shops nearby.  We highly recommend staying in Robert and Anke's apartment on your visit to Amsterdam. We wouldn't have changed a thing...Thanks Robert and Anke for your hospitality!  "
2654288,"Gaby & Sheryl's apartment in Amsterdam is perfect for all sorts of travellers and was clean and tidy as advertised. Would happily stay again and heavily recommend this beautiful, fun Airbnb. "
2680955,"Simple and small but clean. I met Vivian's husband because she was out of town. I loved my stay. I felt just right at home. Marga was very nice and helpful during the booking process. Unfortunately I had to cancel at the last minute, but I will definitely try to stay at her place next time I come. "
2711214,"Nous étions 3  avec mes jumelles de 15 ans. La maison est spacieuse et décorée avec goût . La chambre est confortable et nous avions toutes les attentions d'accueil : produits  d'hygiène de base ,serviettes et même des sucreries de bienvenue. Le petit déjeuner est soigné  et délicieux. Les informations concernant les déplacements intra et extra muros étaient précieuses pour circuler dans une ville que l'on découvre. Nous ne pouvions espérer mieux en B&B . 4 jours avec Joke était un vrai plaisir: elle est  à la fois discrète et à nos petits soins. Cest une personne chaleureuse que l'on a envie de mieux connaître et tisser des liens plus profonds.C'est une adresse à recommander si vous appréciez: confort, qualité, hygiène, éducation et sourire. "
2721047,"We stayed in Simon and Gisele's home for 5 nights from September 8.  They are gracious hosts that provide everything you might need in a rental.  The location is quiet, close to Rembrandtplein and steps from the tram.  Great for a family but those with mobility issues may find the stairs an issue.  All in all would stay here anytime."
2790317,"Amazing location, near everything, bus from/to Schipol is in front of it, MacBike is in front of it. Sunny apartment with great view and a small terrace perfect to drink a glass of wine at the end of the day. Apartment has everything needed to make ourselves comfortable plus is petite, cozy and unclogged. Robert was a very attencious host and has instructed us about everything in the city. He even took us for a bike ride one night that we'll never forget. :) The apartment is just perfect for a couple. The only thing you need to pay attention is not to bring a big suitcase due to inexistence of a lift on the building. We loved our stay in Amsterdam. We absolutely think of coming back. "
2808108,"This is the perfect place to stay in Amsterdam. You are in the middle of the action, but yet when you want to sleep , the room is quite and comfortable . Everything was super tidy and clean. Excellent bed ... And those pillows.. Highly recommended "
2817844,"Mirjam is a very kind and friendly person, prepares an excellent and plentiful breakfast . The room is very nice and confortable. the room is in the city center of Amsterdam is very easy visit all the attractions near here. I recommend everyone to stay by Mirjam."
2821246,"We had a fantastic stay. The area where the accommodation is located, is lovely, you can find anything you desire just few steps away, the cotycenter, the canals, restaurants, shops. <br/>Matthijs was a fantastic host, who understood, what we wanted when we asked for a certain kind of restaurant, - and even sent me back the pracelet that i had forgotten in the room.<br/>The room, the house and the bathroom are perfectly clean, and you have not only toweln but even bathrobes.<br/>So: all in all - we had the feeling to be in a cozy place wirh a heartwarmingly friendly host from second one. Would very recommend. "
2825232,"Our stay was great,  just wonderful! <br/>The apartment is really nice, big,  very good location and wonderful view. <br/>We really enjoyed it. <br/>We will be back for sure."
2846268,"Anneke was a great host and we really enjoyed our stay on her lovely and pretty houseboat. <br/><br/>The houseboat is super nice, clean and pretty furnished, enjoying a breakfast with a view on the canal is just a real highlight. <br/>Anneke prepared our breakfast with lots of love and it was so delicious and yummi. <br/><br/>Next to a great breakfast and the pretty houseboat Anneke is also a really helpful and friendly person. She offered us her Bikes, her umbrellas and was also helpful with tips what to see in Amsterdam and especially how to get there. <br/><br/>So all in all I would always recommend Anneke and give 5 ***** plus for her houseboat! If you want to visit Amsterdam, stay at Anneke's place!"
2858478,"We loved the house. It is pretty, super clean and in a very quiet area so that one can relax. Everything in the kitchen was provided, also for breakfast. Thank you, Cecile. it was a pleasure"
2881097,"The apartment is cozy and warm, with french doors that open onto a beautiful garden.  It is located on a quiet street & conveniently near rail stops and wonderful cafes.  The apartment is like new with a beautiful bathroom, complete with a walk-in shower & a heated towel bar.<br/>Jo was a wonderful hostess.  All Airbnb hosts should be this accommodating.   She had information on all things to do in Amsterdam,  including local restaurants and cafes.  We were very comfortable in Amsterdam all because of Jo and her wonderful garden apartment."
2888803,"Very cosy, quiet and comfortable. The area is very very nice, 20 minutes walking from town center, 10 from Wateloo plein. Joke is very kind, she left us basic breakfast and some snacks and beers. Perfect for couples or small groups of friends."
2904819,Ad & Anna's flat was perfect for our 3 day visit to Amsterdam.  Location was absolutely wonderful- we walked all over Amsterdam and saw most sights easily.  The neighborhood is away from tourists and full of quaint cozy bars and restaurants.  The flat has plenty of space for a couple.  Comfortable beds and pillows and a small kitchenette and eating area.  The only negative is that there are no windows / natural light as it is in the back basement area.  It did have a small 'door' in the ceiling to let in fresh air which helped and the entire back wall is frosted glass.  We felt like this got us out and about instead of staying indoors!
2929059,"Andrea is a great host. She was waiting for us at the exact time we arranged and explained everything about the flat and the neighborhood upon arrival. Her place is spotless and the room is very big, bright and confortable with all the amenities included (bathrobes, towels, a small fridge, dishes, glasses and anything you need for a quick breakfast inside your room). The decoration of the room makes it very classy, modern and some how minimalistic (everything is black and grey). We loved it. It is just 4 min walking to the train station and bus stops, which can take you directly to the city in 15 min or 8 stops more or less. The flat is located in very safe neighbourhood outside the city center surrounded by condos inside a park where you can jog if you want every morning. Thanks for everything Andrea. Was great meeting you."
2937554,"This place is exactly what I look for in a great AirBNB: central location, very responsive host, an easy process to check in and just the right amenities. Got a great night's sleep and two lovely days in Amsterdam, which was very easy to navigate from this location. I only wish I'd also booked a massage! Would come back here anytime and highly recommend."
2944027,"Die Unterkunft ist wie auf den Bildern abgebildet. Das Zimmer hat eine ausreichende Größe für 2 Personen. Ein kleiner Kühlschrank, ein Wasserkocher, Gläser, Teller und Besteck waren vorhanden, um Kleinigkeiten zuzubereiten. Darüber hinaus hat uns Jeroen mit frischen Handtüchern versorgt. Die Bushaltestelle und ein Einkaufszentrum liegen nur 3 min. von der Unterkunft entfernt. Zum Hauptbahnhof fahren alle 10 min. Busse. Die Fahrtzeit beträgt maximal 15 min. Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt. Jeroen hat uns herzlich willkommen und uns viele Tips gegeben und war immer ansprechbar. Vielen Dank dafür. Wir würden hier wieder übernachten. "
2949357,"We had an amazing time in Marijke's apartment. The location was PERFECT. The design made us feel like we were at home in NYC but with the perfect amount of Amsterdam charm.  That bed is so damn comfortable we had a difficult time waking up in the morning but that's a very good thing! Marijke couldn't meet us but her lovely friend Douwe was there to greet us perfectly on time and give us some tips about the area. Marijke's next door neighbor Hyacyntia turned out to be one of the highlights of our trip as she was HYSTERICAL, warm and so kind as to allow us to leave our luggage at her place and then she DROVE us to the airport! Unreal! Highly recommend staying here. The only downside is there is not enough light in the bathroom which made getting ready to go out a bit of a challenge. This certainly should NOT be a deterrent for anyone when deciding to book this apartment. It's still getting 5 stars in our book and we will definitely return next time! <br/>"
2958783,"Vibeke was a great host. She was in contact to meet us before we came to Amsterdam, she welcomed us so politely when we met in her house, informed us about the transportaton, the places to see, she was so helpful about everything. She was a perfect host."
2962796,The house look everything like the pictures provided and was in a really great area especially for kids! Close to the Vondelpark with a great playground and many kid-shops nearby! Only disappointment was that it was a little bit cold and the heating not optimal. If the sun is shining this would however be a nice place to get in the shade!
2970856,"My little son and me had a wonderful time in Amsterdam at Petra's place. Everything was perfectly arranged. We had the chance to meet Petra, who is a very open and kind host. The breakfast we ordered was very good. And the B&B is really quiet and nevertheless close to the city centre which you can reach by walking easily. <br/>And reality beats the pictures by far: the rooms were so clean and so nicely decorated. We felt like sleeping in a little palace. We can really recommend Petra's place."
3001956,"Beim Einchecken war Peter sehr entgegenkommend - unser Zug hatte Verspätung, das war aber kein Problem für ihn! Das Hausboot ist sehr gemütlich und das Bett hat für zwei Personen eine sehr gute Größe. Einen Supermarkt in der Nähe haben wir leider nicht gefunden, aber in der Innenstadt gibt es genügend Supermärkte (z.B. hinter dem Dam), so dass man gut vor dem Nachhausefahren einkaufen kann. Das Hausboot liegt in einem recht ruhigen Grachtenbereich und unter Deck hört man gar nichts mehr (gut isoliert). Von der Straßenbahnhaltestelle ist es zu Fuß nur drei, vier Minuten entfernt und leicht zu finden. Das Hausboot ist auf jeden Fall ein Erlebnis in Amsterdam, das man nicht verpassen sollte :-)<br/><br/>"
3006727,"Great location, nice place and warm host. 100% recommend and will stay once more  visiting Amsterdam!"
3017087,Alojamiento confortable y limpio. Muy buena ubicacion. Todo como estaba anunciado. El anfitrion correcto y educado. Muy recomendable
3027421,"The flat is really nice, in the center (more it's not possible). The room is perfect, clean and really nice !<br/>It was a really nice stay and Matthijs was really helpfull with us.<br/>Thanks a lot ! "
3032375,"We're quite particular (neat/clean/aesthetics are very important) and we thoroughly enjoyed staying at Ingo's place. We're recommending it to other friends, it's a find.<br/>Ingo communicated with us very promptly/politely throughout our stay and was very relaxed. His place is super well-located, away from the very busy areas, spacious and open/airy, with a fab window looking right over a nice part of the canal. Our daughter slept on his chaise in the living room and we had the private bedroom. We were provided with everything we needed -- from coffee to full kitchen to prepare some meals, to laundry facilities (a huge plus). More amenities than we even needed/used, thanks, Ingo!"
3043454,"This is just a great place it is very calm and quiet! Apartment you betray the romance and comfort! Else can prepare yourself as there own beautiful kitchen! Nearby you can rent bikes for just 7.50 euros a day! Center 20 minutes but you will enjoy the beauty of the road Amsterdam! Mathilde is very warm and inviting, I put 100 balls this apartment!"
3054877,"We stayed with Olaf only briefly, sad to say as it was a super AirBnb in a fantastic city.  First, Olaf is such a warm, energetic, upbeat person to be with--even in friendly Holland, he stands out.  <br/><br/>He made special arrangements for us to pick up the keys a day earlier so as not to interrupt our travel plans and spent quite a  bit of time getting us sorted our for transport and some off the beaten track suggestions.   <br/><br/>Second, the flat is something to experience--the decor is so unique, quirky and just plain fun that you really do feel you are in a ""fantasy"" land.  Accommodations were comfy and well thought out.<br/><br/>The neighborhood is quiet and residential, but hip in feel.  Do not miss the Ethiopian restaurant around the corner that Olaf suggested.  It was really terrific and a good value.  Transport by tram is easy from his house to center or the train station--Amstel.<br/><br/>One caveat, this is an older typical historic houses and like most, the upper floors require a hike up narrow stairs.  It's no problem unless you have mobility issues.  We're in our 60's and pretty fit; even one of us with ""knee issues"" could do it, watching for safety and being a bit slow.  <br/><br/>Anyway, you can't miss with this Airbnb--a great spot, great host in one of Europe's most livable cities in a country full of exciting places to see.<br/><br/>Olaf, do you want a room-mate?  LOL"
3056817,"Could not ask for better hosts, room or location! I was often out exploring, but whenever I needed anything at the house Prema and Arjan made sure I was taken care of, not to mention they're both fun to be around and extremely kind. Add to the fact that the house is in a great neighborhood with great bus/subway lines and a bike rental shop around the corner makes it a great place to stay while visiting Amsterdam.  6 out of 5 stars!<br/>Ps: the steam shower makes you feel as good as it looks in the picture :)"
3074707,"We stayed in early June 2014. The Pictures are exactly correct, the apartment is fantastic, great large living room with huge canal windows.  <br/><br/>I am always a little nervous about the bed, but it was comfy and perfect.. lots of mid day naps.  We did several loads of laundry, no problems... cooking in the amazing kitchen, etc. There is a simple grocery story at the end of the block .. great place. <br/><br/>The apartment is in a perfect location for walking and biking. From the apartment, you can get to anywhere in the city in 15 on a bike. Your walking distance from 30 restaurants, coffee shops, cafes, etc. <br/><br/>The hosts were fantastic, we exchanged a ton of emails before and during our stay. They always had great information , they made us feel super comfortable and welcome. <br/><br/>If we come back to Amsterdam we will absolutely try to stay at the same place.<br/><br/>-Jeff"
3074880,"Stephan was a gracious and accommodating host from beginning to end.  And what a great apartment!!!  My two friends and I, weary from a long drive from Berlin that day, felt so welcomed as soon as we were greeted by Stephan.  He showed us everything we needed to know around the apartment and truly made us feel like his home was now our home.  He offered advice on transportation, recommendations for the area, and said to contact him at any time during our stay, if needed.<br/>We felt relaxed and comfortable here - hooked up our i-pod to the stereo, sipped tea, and enjoyed the beautiful view from the couch.  Even the cushy carpet was comfortable to lounge on.  Not to mention the rain shower... what a treat!<br/><br/>Stephan and his home are A+++.  <br/><br/>Thanks a million!<br/>"
3092277,"The place to stay- perfect location in the best neighbourhood in Amsterdam; romantic, trendy, leafy, classical. Flat was very easy to find, we arrived in taxi, easy distance to the centre. Corina is an AMAZING host. She waited up for us till late to give all info on what to see, where to eat and how to get by. Room was fantastic with private garden. We had the most comfortable sleep ever away from home. Incredibly comfortable bed with the warmest duvet, it was hard to leave the bed in the morning. Great host will all amenities provided (towels, tea etc...), like a hotel but better. A gem!!!"
3098487,"In a nutshell ... Fabulous place especially for a large group like ours. <br/><br/>While we didnt get a chance to meet Heidi in person, he went out of his way provide really helpful tips and to set things up in a way that we had a memorable stay.Karl, who hosted us on Heidi's behalf too was very amicable and helpful.<br/><br/>The house is very spacious and gives a really homely feeling. We settled in very well. In terms of location, very few places (if any at all) esp for larger groups can be so centrally located. Many key  tourist attractions arewithin walking distance and yet the house, being in a residential ""niche"" by the canal, is cut off from the crowds.<br/><br/>Highly recommended.<br/>"
3098522,"We had a great time staying at Joost's place in Amsterdam. The bed is probably the most comfortable bed on Earth. It's about a 25 minute walk to the centre of town, but there is a metro station very close which takes you to the centre in only 4 stops. The walk into town is very nice though so we enjoyed it. The house was very clean and the shower, kitchen & bed are all brilliant. The garden is a lovely touch too. Especially if the sun is out. "
3098749,"Lovely hosts, very accommodating - I was unable to meet at the original check-in time so were flexible and let me come an hour earlier. Clean, tidy, very cute room! Great location - very central but you can't hear any of the noise outside. Breakfast at the nearby De Laatste Kruimel was just the right amount and it's such a cute cafe. Perfect - thanks very much!"
3116162,"The place was clean, with a very good bed and excellent shower. The gentle rocking of the house and the birds by the water complimented the floating house experience, heating and Air condition working perfectly. Location was good in a quiet neighborhood with lots of transportation options to the major parts of the city. <br/><br/>But the best was Diewert. On our second day my wife suffered an accident and broke her ankle. This completly destroyed our holidays. However Diewert was very helpful and accomodating: told me where to find open drugstores, got some extra info from the hospital that I needed for my insurance, helped us order some food since my wife couldn't walk around, lent me his bike so I could run some errands, booked our taxi when I found a flight back home, among many other smal things. This attitude helped smooth the situation we found ourselves in.<br/><br/>We hope to go back to Amsterdam and experience the city properly with no accidents. Hopefully Diewert will be a part of that experience once again."
3120332,"We had a great time staying at Daan ' s place. There are 2 correctable issues 1.) There is NO AIR CONDITIONING. I am sure Daan will make the correction on his Airbnb website to accurately depict this under the amenities list so people are not misinformed. 2.) We had communicated 3 different times with Daan asking questions by email but never got a single reply. As super host's ourselves, it would be polite to respond to emails. Besides that, the apartment is as described by other guests and the pictures are accurate. We rate a place based on the cleanliness, location, paint on the wall, ceilings, spaciousness, flooring, bathroom and kitchen amenities and appliances, drapes, windows, TV, internet,  upkeep of the home and decor. In all categories it was good, to very good, to excellent. It is comparable to all the other Super Host homes we stayed in Europe and priced appropriately as compared to the high end cities such as Copenhagen, London and Paris in the low $200 's US. Daan is very pleasant and we had a fantastic time staying at his place in early summer. The weather was perfect. And,  yes, the kitchen is very well stocked. Thanks Daan for making our last stop in Europe of our 2 month trip great!"
3128106,Perfect place in the perfect city. I felt in love with the canal house within entering the door:-) Everything is clean and well-designed. I loved to chill out on the couch. Watching over the bridge- people walking along on the street. You can´t stay closer to the center- it is the center. Check-in and out was well organized. You get an original welcome notice just for you:-) Sweet. Thanks Edward - it was an amazing time. You are a great host. Please offer this place next year as well. We would love to come again!
3134959,"Absolutely amazing multi level place. Fit all five of us comfortably. Would highly recommend this place.<br/>Daniel was a superb host, always easily contactable, met us on arrival and provided the grand tour.<br/>5 stars"
3155873,Superb place to stay... really cute bed- very cozy.  There was everything we needed except a hairdryer.  The location is perfect and the breakfast place is amazing.  This is a treasure to find in Amsterdam.
3175844,"My friends and I stayed as a group of 6 on the luxury houseboat, we hardly saw our hosts as they came to drop off and collect the keys but did not stay with us on the houseboat. The houseboat itself is lovely; a nice big living space with a good kitchen, large dining table and open plan lounge with a good stereo (and a fire that looked great for winter.) The bed rooms were a reasonable size and the bathrooms are modern and well designed.  We made full use of the waterside deck eating breakfasts, lunch and sunbathing on it and we had a BBQ one evening.  The shops are really close by - a supermarket, a bakery, a pharmacy, a few resturants and some cafes are all within walking distance, so are the tram and bus stops to get to the town centre. The houseboat is really close to the Westerpark; we took a picnic with us on the final day and sat in the sunshine.  We agreed to look after their cat Simba whilst we stayed which wasn't a problem at all - she largely ignored us!  The houseboat is really quiet and peaceful. Definitely a beautiful place to live. If you have no plans for what to do whilst in Amsterdam, try a boat tour of the canals or visit the zoo as it is a fantastic day out for any age group. We've had a brilliant weekend and would definitely go back. We would like stay at this houseboat again if possible and we would certainly recommend it to others. "
3185678,"Anjo and Mirre were great and the apartment was comfortable and in a very central location. The apartment is right on the street with the main red light district - so that could be a plus or minus depending on who you are. The internet wasn't working while we were there, so you may want to check first to see if that is fixed first if you really need it. Other than the internet, everything went great!"
3189056,"Roel's windmill was probably our favorite part of Amsterdam.  Roel and his windmill had a warm and welcoming vibe.  It was a nice escape from the hustle of the busy city center. Roel had many special little cozy touches from the warm cozy robe, sandals,  and breakfast, to the fresh hand squeezed orange juice. If you ever find yourself in Amsterdam I highly recommended that you attempt to stay here, as long as you are willing to stay outside the city. It books quite fast.  It is about a 20 minute easy walk to tram 13, or you can take a bus to the tram.  It's a 20 min tram ride to Amsterdam Centraal Station. You can also take a 30 min uber ride to or from the station for about €15-35  depending on how busy it is.  The Tram is €2.90 for one hour or €7.50 for 24 hours. Bus rides are included with the tram fair.  You buy your tickets on either the tram or bus.  Tram stops running around Midnight.  Overall we loved staying here, it provided a retreat from our busy travel schedule.  We hope to return in the future."
3192291,"Very good accommodation experience! Delft style room, very clean! Matthijs gave me Amsterdam travel information, very nice! The room is located in the city centre, very convenient  also very quiet, excellent！and the excellent breakfast  is recommended！房东很和善，还经营可简单按摩的服务，房间位于市中心很棒的位置，传统街区、传统风格，吃早餐的地址就在运河边，房间明亮但朝北，一点不冷，有暖气。这里是个很好的选择。"
3203719,"Maike and Caspar's place was an excellent place to stay in Amsterdam! We stayed in their room for 4 nights and enjoyed every moment of it. It is away from the hustle and bustle of the city, it is quiet, the view is wonderful, and the amenities excellent. I missed it when I left! I would absolutely recommend it to anyone coming to visit Amsterdam. Their dogs are very cute and the breakfast they served every morning was an absolute delight. Thank you so much, Maike and Caspar! Amsterdam was great, but your place made the experience even better :)"
3211102,"Ingo's Canal house is a great place to stay and experience Amsterdam. It's a fantastic location, very close to everything you'd want to see as a a visitor, but still in a quiet area. The apartment itself is spacious and bright - because it's on a corner, you have a great view from the living room (very big windows) where you can literally sit on the couch and watch Amsterdam life go by. All the amenities are top quality - WIFI, two TVs (the living room has a big entertainment center) a modern kitchen, great bathroom, and a very comfortable bedroom. <br/><br/>Ingo as a host was very responsive throughout the whole process, met us at the apartment with a chilled bottle of prosecco and had some stroopwaffels waiting for us. <br/><br/>You have literally everything you could need very close to the apartment - Casa Di David next door has great Italian food and pizza.<br/><br/>Definitely a great experience - you feel very safe and at home here. "
3216628,"We had a wonderful stay at Enith's place! The room ist spacious, the bed is super comfy and the rooftop terrace is spectacular! Enith's house has a very welcoming vibe to it - so does Enith. She does anything she can to make you feel comfortable - be it with giving directions, offering snacks (coffee maker and kettle plus snacks in the room; she even offered us some wine) or just having a chat in the evening. The location is very nice, away from the bustling city center but easily reachable. Still, there are some nice breakfast places just a 5-minute walk away. The tram takes you downtown in 10-15mins. I can recommend this place without any hesitation! Thanks for a great time, Enith :) "
3221736,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in Hein's studio. Great location as it is far away enough from all the noise yet close enough to walk to many exciting locations. <br/>Hein was nice and gave a brief informative rundown of the city and the places one should definitely check out. He will give you a map that helps a ton!<br/>The room was cozy and clean. I could not ask for a more comfortable stay. <br/>Thank you, Hein!"
3271036,"Wir hatten einen schönen Aufenthalt in Amsterdam! Marloes und Gabriel kann ich als Gastgeber uneingeschränkt empfehlen. Die Wohnung ist stilvoll eingerichtet, bietet alles was man braucht und verfügt sogar über einen kleinen Außenbereich, wo man bei schönem Wetter draußen sitzen kann. Es gibt auch Fahrräder zur freien Verfügung, was sehr praktisch ist. Die Lage der Wohnung ist in Ordnung, mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln (Tram) oder mit dem Rad ist man in 15 Minuten im Zentrum angekommen. Die Wohngegend ist sehr ruhig und gepflegt. <br/>Der einzige Minuspunkt war, dass die Gastgeber einmal in dem Apartment waren und aufgeräumt und das Bett gemacht haben. Das ist zwar eine nette Geste, aber ich finde es nicht gut, wenn alle persönlichen Wertgegenstände in der Wohnung liegen und jemand ohne unser Wissen hineingeht. Sowas hätte vorher abgesprochen werden müssen. <br/>Ansonsten kann ich die Unterkunft absolut weiterempfehlen, für 2 Personen ist sie perfekt und von der Centraal Station oder dem Flughafen leicht zu erreichen. "
3271159,"We had a great week in Amsterdam thanks a lot to Matthijs.<br/>He knows the good places to go and he share it with us.<br/>The room is located at the best place, exactly in the center,<br/>but very quiet.<br/>The room was warm and clean, with a big comfortable bed, and a lot of light."
3276431,"Enith is the perfect host, she made our stay very easy : she gave us very accurate directions to come from the station and she was very helpful. The room was really clean and full of snacks and coffee/tea! I'd highly recommend her!"
3291906,"I stayed at Rose's place for 5 days as I was in Amsterdam for business. I can only give my highest possible recommendations for Rose and her apartment! Location was perfect. Everthing was just very nice and clean, there was a private modern bathroom and fabulous breakfast provided every day. Rose and her partner are very easy-going and lovely hosts, very easy to talk to. <br/>I give my highest possible rating for my airbnb experience at Rose's place."
3313015,"My partner and I relocated to Amsterdam from Sydney, Australia and stayed in Nathalie and Sarah's apartment for our first week and we had an amazing experience.  The apartment is massive, with lots of homely decorative touches and warm light which makes you feel cosy and at home. The kitchen is equipped with everything you need (and welcome drinks in the fridge!) and is a pleasure to cook in. There are lots of stairs but, hey, that's Europe.  There are two toilets on either floor which is handy and the bathroom is very spacious and well lit. The queen bed is super comfy but the showstopper is the sunny rooftop which is like your own secret garden. Perfect for an afternoon cheese and wine session. <br/><br/>In terms of location we don't think you can beat Joordan. So many cafes and small bars and restaurants and the perfect vibe (not too touristy) but an easy walk to Anne Frank House and the centre.<br/><br/>Sarah our host was perfect and checked in via email to make sure we were feeling at home.  I will be recommending this property to all my visiting friends and family... it's like a home away from home and I miss it already!  "
3327232,"What a remarkable place Remco's flat is! In the heart of the De Pijp area, with a great view over a canal and with good restaurants just a short walk away. <br/>The flat is tastefully decorated and is extremely well equipped - indeed, it's even better than the pictures suggest. There's a great living room and a well-fitted kitchen that opens on to a small balcony - great for breakfasting in the sun.<br/>The bedroom I used was upstairs - spacious and well furnished with a comfortable bed and a wonderful bathroom with acres of space.<br/>Overall, this is a listing that is thoroughly recommended. Thanks, Remco."
3353242,Toetsie is a great host. She was always very friendly. And her house is so cozy and beautiful. The location is perfect - nice quiet street but close to city centre. We really enjoyed our stay in Amsterdam.
3356170,"This place far far exceeds our expectation!  <br/><br/>Initially we decided to stay here because we needed time to find more permanent place (we were gonna stay in Amsterdam for 4 years). We knew we made the right choice when we arrived. At the first glance, the inside of the studio was really neat and luxurious. The neighborhood is calm, peaceful, and serene, you'll wake up to the sound of bird singing. <br/>To top it off, Marloes & Gabriel really are wonderful hosts! They are nice and friendly, they picked us up from the station, shared useful tips to slowly dip into Amsterdam, and lend us their bike for a whole day. We even got a crash course on Holland's real estate,  really helpful regarding our situation. Gabriel even went out his way and helped us put our luggage to the new apartment. Can't imagine a better first impression living in Holland!<br/><br/>On the other hand if you want to be left alone, it's alright as well (you'll miss out on their warm hospitality, but hey it's your choice). The studio is situated just outside their house and you have your private entrance from the side of the studio.<br/><br/>All and all, definitely recommended! Do yourself a favor and book this place!"
3367121,Robert and Anke are fabulous host. They were always fast to answer and even provide us advices before we ask them.  They also make sure to let us a Baby bed in their appartement for Our 7 months old little girl. The appartement is really clean and bright and it's perfectly located near all the attractions and good restaurants.<br/>I will recommend it to anyone!!!
3369534,"Le studio possède un emplacement de rêve en plein centre à 10 min à pied de la gare. Si vous venez en voiture nous vous conseillons le parking Oosterdok proche et à un prix raisonnable. Absolument tous les points d’intérêt touristique sont accessibles à pied.<br/>Le studio est situé en entresol avec un accès privé. Il est très bien équipé et la décoration moderne et épurée joue avec les couleurs du drapeau d'Amsterdam. La propreté est impeccable. Nous y avons dormi (très bien) une nuit. Pour le p. déjeuner vous trouverez thé, café, lait, jus d'orange, ainsi que les biscottes, le beurre et les confitures.<br/>Raul est un hôte très sympathique, accueillant, efficace et pas du tout envahissant. Nous vous conseillons chaleureusement ce logement. "
3378077,"Mark was very friendly and welcoming. The apartment is great and is very well located. Bike rental shop at the end of the street, great restaurants nearby, location is ideal. <br/><br/>We'd definitely recommend staying there."
3378246,"I don't have words to express how we enjoyed staying at Joke's apartment. She was simply amazing in every single detail. I would say that we were never so well treated on a trip as we were by Joke.<br/>We felt at home.<br/>Joke was perfect until in the informations about how to arrive in her apartment and walking through the city using the public transportation.<br/>It's Important speak that in addition to English and Dutch, she speaks Portuguese fluently, which for us, Brazilians, it was very important.<br/>Amsterdam is a fantastic city and, in my opinion, the location and other attributes of the Joke's apartment make it an excellent place to stay.<br/>I strongly recommend Joke's apartment to stay and i hope back there some day.<br/>Feel free to contact in case of doubts."
3379420,"We had a great stay at Stef's place and it was exactly as advertised. The outdoor patio was lovely and a great extension to the space. The morning coffee provided in the room was a great perk. Comfortable bedding, lots of light, and great little place for our short got away. Thanks for having us Stef and we would love to visit again!"
3396174,"Olaf is a very nice host! Dynamic, and lots of great ideas for some stuff to do in Amsterdam! "
3399014,"Jeroen was a welcoming and uncomplicated host. The room is very nice and the place is clean.<br/>The neighborhood is very quiet but if you get a bike it's a only a 15min ride to the ferry which will take you for free to Amsterdam Central in 2min.<br/>I wouldn't recommend it for warm summer nights because you cannot  open the window."
3405294,"Maaike & Menno were really kind to leave us a detailed description of the neighborhood and of their home facilities!The neighbors were kind and the district was quite and well connected to the city center with public transports. The apartment is beautiful, clean and well furnished! I would go there again :-) Cheers Barbara"
3429589,"Our stay was perfect. Ifigenia is lovely, the studio is amazing, clean, in the city center. She gave us all the good plans (to eat, to visit, to go out at night) Thank you Ifigenia !!!! :) "
3478908,"It was really nice trip to Ams, mostly because of ur flat in center of Amsterdam. It was nice and clean. And breakfast was amazing! I recommend :-)"
3499899,"We had a wonderful stay. Marieke was a lovely host and made a huge effort to make sure we were comfortable - she even gave me her eye drops when I had forgotten mine! The neighborhood is very cool with great restaurants and you are still in the center within a 10 minute cycle ride along the beautiful Amstel river. <br/><br/>The flat has a great retro 70's interior with a record player and all. There is coffee and tea, and we even had a bottle of wine as a little welcome gift. Amsterdam houses are old and not very well insulated so I would recommend bringing ear plugs if you're a light sleeper like myself. We could occasionally hear the neighbors and the tram but still slept very well with regular ear plugs. The flat has a very efficient heater and you can also open the windows if you like to have some fresh air. There's a little kitchen with a fridge and cooking plates so yu can visit the Albert Hein supermarket close by and make your own breakfasts etc. We found this very handy!<br/><br/>The bikes provided are great and even come with little lights for night time cycling. I would definitely recommend getting around by bike, but the public transport is also very efficient and close by. <br/><br/>Thanks very much for a lovely stay Marieke, we hope to come back soon!  This is a stylish flat in a great neighbourhood. The bed is very comfy and the kitchen super well equipped. I used the washing machine lots during my one week stay. There are really cute parakeets visiting the trees just outside the windows and the neigbourhood has tons of restaurants - make sure to visit Foodhallen in the same block! This is a great place in a fantastic neighbourhood! Light and spacious with great amenities, yet quiet at night. Surrounded by many amazing restaurants and cafes. <br/>T is a wonderful host, that was super flexible with my changing check-in times due to a delayed flight etc. Much appreciated!"
3501559,"We were quite disappointed with this Airbnb experience having had a number of really positive experiences in other places. There were a number of things that were awkward and did not make us feel welcome in Rosie's home. Check in time on Friday was 2 hours later than advertised due to the cleaner being present. Although we were able to pick up the keys at the check in time, we could not access our room until later in the day. We could have planned better if we had known this in advance.  Rosie wants to make sure her guests know the house rules - so much so that they are posted on the bedside table and back of the bedroom door. The ""check-in"" consisted of Rosie sitting us down to explain the rules about the toilet and locking the door at night. In the morning, we were ""reminded"" of the check out time by sms 20 mins prior and then got a knock on our bedroom door at the check out time. This seemed quite excessive and the strict punctuality of the check out time could have been better explained at the ""check in"" rather than the detailed explanation on the functionality of the toilet.  It seemed like the bare minimum was provided eg 1 shower gel (no shampoo or hand soap ) in the bathroom and overall we felt like our presence in her home was more of an inconvenience! On the plus side, the house is very clean and as in the photos. The area is also really nice and we could just about justify the price we paid given the cleanliness of the room and the location of the flat, as the experience itself did leave a lot to be desired unfortunately. "
3512422,"Miriam was a wonderful host, and I loved my stay in the spare room of her apartment. She was at work when I arrived, but communication prior to arrival was seamless and her friend let me in and showed me around. The location couldn't be more central or perfect - a ten minute walk to the central station and in the middle of such great neighborhoods to explore. The room was spacious, very clean, and pretty - a beautiful A-framed top floor space, with views of other classic old buildings. And I got to have a lovely chat with Miriam during the evening. I hope to come back someday! "
3517603,Best place to stay in Amsterdam. Close to major famous places. A++
3523750,"Lots of very steep stairs up to the apartment which could cause issues for some people, with small children or large luggage. The apartment was clean & comfortable. No TV though, & the second bed meant for 2 people was really very small & not big enough. Also very hard to get up to the roof terrace which we ended up not making use of at all. But all in all it was a nice stay, although I'm glad we weren't there for more than 3 nights. "
3526752,"Thomas' place was perfect for my boyfriend and I we were there for over a week and it was in a great part of town very close to the centre and a lot of great restaurants. Thomas was super helpful and we could reach him at any time. He was away but everything went so smoothly with a friend meeting us with the keys. Can't say enough about the place and our whole experience! The only downside was the construction outside, they were drilling the road some nights all through the night. No fault to the apartment just unfortunate timing. Overall Great! I will be staying there again next time I'm in Amsterdam! "
3526934,"We were attending a fair at the RAI and the apartment of Hetty was very useful. Only 10 minutes by walk from there we could have our breakfast without any hurry. The apartment is nice with three rooms, perfect for a group. It's also a bit old and does not have the same comfort than an hotel. But we spend a very good short stay with a nice meat restaurant at 50 meters from there! Thanks for the accommodation Hetty, your French was perfect :) see you "
3527597,"The apparatment was amazing. Really well located, bright and really clean! With the possibility to rent bikes just in front of the house!<br/><br/>Also, it is important to say that Robert was an incredible host, he helped us with some recomendations on what to do and where to go in Amsterdam!<br/><br/>"
3527769,"Clean, bright appartment with a comfortable bed. Great location with a beautiful view in a quaint neighborhood a stone's throw away from all the action. Met Daniel who brought the keys upon our arrival, everything ran smoothly. We will definitely be back x"
3533869,"Stanza molto luminosa, accogliente e pulita, a due passi da Piazza Dam e dalla Stazione Centrale. Colazione deliziosa. Ci tornerò sicuramente, siamo stati molto bene. <br/>il padrone di casa è molto gentile e ci tiene molto ai suoi ospiti.<br/>grazie per la bella esperienza avuta ad Amsterdam."
3556756,"My boyfriend, two friends of us and I, spent 4 nights at Annas and Harrys gorgeous houseboat. <br/>Even it rains a lot during our stay in Amsterdam our holiday was not a flop, because of our great accommodation. The houseboat was clean and cozy and we used the kitchen to cook a lot of delicious meals. Also we had so much fun cruising around in Amsterdam with the bikes. Therefore we used the bus to get to the Jachtshavenweg and had no problems to find the pier. The area was really nice and quiet and Anna gave us a warm welcome. <br/><br/>We can recommend Annas and Harrys place to everyone who likes to have a memorable time in Amsterdam and we would always stay again at the houseboat! <br/>"
3564742,Marijke's place was excellent. Very comfy and convenient to central Amsterdam. There's also a bunch of shops/cafés/bars close by. I would absolutely stay again next time I'm in Amsterdam. 
3565404,"I had a great stay - host, apartment, location - everything was perfect! Toetsie provides everything you need for breakfast as well as a bike! And the cat is great too :) "
3576355,Great location in the middle of Amsterdam! Really nice breakfast every morning from Peter. The house is a little clairaudient.
3596023,"I personally would not recommend this apartment. There was a weird smell and not so good ventilation. It is really not isolated and the bedroom is in front of the house, so you can enjoy all noise from the streets (trams, busses, cars and people walking by). <br/><br/>The area and the square hoofddorpplein is a cool place to stay, so that is a plus. Also the cats are really sweet. "
3607064,Rosie is a delightful host! My flight arrived late on a Friday night and she worked with me so I could have a late check-in. The room is cheery and in a terrific neighborhood (very close to the museums). I spent 3 nights here and enjoyed every moment. Rosie is available to you if you need her and I liked chatting with her very much. Enjoy her lovely space.
3617047,"We had a fabulous time in Amsterdam! David's apartment is as advertised - it looks exactly like the photo - and was clean and comfortable.  It was an easy walk from Amsterdam Central (we took the train in from the airport) and close to all the city's attractions.  The apartment is one block over from one of the main drags, which meant it was convenient but not too noisy.  You could hear people on the street but it was very manageable.  David was a good communicator and made key coordination very easy.  He left us a picnic basket full of breakfast items every morning. (Thank you David, the crossaint was so delicous!)  David was such a wonderful host.  We would stay here again in a heart beat!<br/>Sent from my iPad"
3646638,Matthijs and Francina were great hosts! They were very accomadating to my heavy luggage and check in times! Matthijs always responded to my emails whenever I had questions. The bakery was also amazing for breakfast. I would definitely stay here again during my next Amsterdam visit! It was conveniently located to Central Station and many other restuarants and shopping! Miss you guys!
3671555,"Thanx again, Edwin, you were really welcoming and helpful, wouldnt really know if there is anything you should change, really. Just keep it up! Stay who you are.<br/>Place is also nice and clean, no complaints here either. And really close to... everything :) [sure, street below is crowded on weekends; for me that was not a problem at all]"

3682176,"the house is nice and in a good area , there is two rooms for rent ,  it fill like a small business. so if its  a business it sould be more professional ,   like   by  answering mails on time , keeping the toilets clean if its a sharing one , and aswering the phone when  planning with the host , also breakfast should be more  with choice and  touch  if you decide  serving  .  im telling  it  with alot of warm for gianni family  they are great people . thank you "

3698234,"Very clean, bed super comfortable and breakfast delicious. Matthijs is also a lovely guy with good suggestions on local experiences. Only reason for the 4 rather than 5 stars is internet was a bit slow.<br/><br/>"
3698266,"We absolutely loved staying at Viola and Daniels place. It was light, cosy and everything we needed (except for a toiletdoor, which we got used to:-))<br/>We would highly recommend staying at their flat and in the Jordaan area, which is quiet, nice and lot's of things to do.<br/>"

We have been there for 2 nights and we fall in love of this place will get back to this apartment asap<br/>around the apartment also nice is that you have all facility and info you will need to make your stay in Amsterdam a great moment.<br/><br/>Thanks for this....... "
3739639,"We stayed on Hanneke's houseboat for five nights, and would heartily recommend it to anyone.  The photos and descriptions are accurate, but what they can't convey is the warm welcome from Hanneke and the care that she has put into making her guests welcome and comfortable.<br/><br/>The fridge was stocked with milk, beer, wine, fruit juice and coke, there was an ample supply of ground coffee and some tea bags, as well as a few basics like olive oil, salt and pepper.  There were fresh flowers on the tables and tea lights to make your evenings cosy and romantic.  The houseboat has very effective central heating, and a great shower, and lots of toiletries supplied.<br/><br/>The houseboat is in a great location too.  There are buses every 10 minutes from the Central Station that take you to a stop just two minutes walk from the houseboat, and you can catch a tram from the same stop that will take you to the museum quarter (Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh Museum etc), or on to the other side of Amsterdam.<br/><br/>But you don't need to get a tram anywhere, because you are on the edge of the beautiful Jordaan area, which is a network of small streets with quirky shops, cafes and restaurants, as well as having supermarkets with easy reach if you are self-catering.  <br/><br/>This was our first time in Amsterdam, and we explored much of the centre of the city, but next time (we can't wait to come again!) we will spend more time in the Jordaan.

3745513,"Prima volta che viaggiavamo con airbnb, direi ottima soluzione. La casa di Petra molto bella, nuova e accogliente, ci sono due stanze matrimoniali, una con bagno al suo interno e una con bagno esterno ma privato. Da dividere (eventualmente con altri ospiti) solo la cucina. Molto pulita. A due passi dalla fermata del tram linea 1 che porta al centro città in 5 minuti e in aeroporto in 10. Sicuramente consigliato!!!! Petra molto carina e disponibile ma soprattutto accogliente. "
3750119,"We booked Mirjam's room for a long weekend in Amsterdam and we cannot be more happy. The room is nice and spacious enough, and Mirjam gave us good advice as to what to visit and how to move around. The flat is situated in a quiet street in the center of the city, so that everything is close enough. The room is in the back part of the house, so that it was very quiet.<br/><br/>We would definitelly recommend Mirjams flat to anyone who wants to spend some days in Amsterdam!"
3768349,"Casa Vrolik is such a warm, cozy and friendly place! Staying there was one of my best experience on Airbnb :-) Toetsie has a big heart and welcomes you in rooms with all your needs, nice, clean and quiet. A little kitchenette with basic things for breakfast. An old, holland-style house in a peaceful, relaxing neighborhood. All is like in the pics, even better! It´s situated between two tram stations, from them the most popular places in Amsterdam are easy to arrive. Supermarkets, Cafes nearby. It was my place to rest during days of work :-) Toetsie is available everytime, answers your questions and cares for everything. and the most important and lovely item: Roki, the cat. Loved relaxing with him :-) definitely recommend this host!!! Hope to see Casa Vrolik and its inhabitants again!    "
3773177,"Our stay was absolutely wonderful. There were 5 of us and we couldn't have been more comfortable. Ellen's place is so beautiful and the pictures really don't do it enough justice. There was more than enough space for all of us and we were beyond happy with our stay. The neighbourhood was   very ideal - just outside the centre, with such delicious restaurants to visit. Would definitely visit again and couldn't recommend it more! "
3789057,"Having stayed at many places via Airbnb and especially in Amsterdam, this was truly the most spacious,  most comfortable and  the most chic place we have stayed. Contact with Rudi was prompt and easy, he even provided the name of an excellent driver for the airport runs. Check in and out was easily arranged to meet our schedules. Although we never met Rudi, this was the first time a host actually called on our arrival to make sure everything went well.<br/>As to the apartment, it was exactly as described and depicted. It was immaculate, modern yet comfortable with an authentic old world dutch feel ,spacious and contained everything that we needed (except an iron). Quit frankly it was in all respects an amazing apartment.  In fact the bed was actually more comfortable than the one we have at home. <br/>In short you know it is great apartment when you would rather sit at the window and soak in the view (including the white swan who apparently lives in the canal) instead of being out in one of the most beautiful cities in the world<br/>As to the area, it is the Jordaan, the nicest and most convenient part of the city.<br/>We look forward to our next trip to Amsterdam and stay at Rudi's apartment."
3807089,"Joke is a perfect host, kind and helpful ! Her appartment is very nice, well located (15 minuts away from city center by tram or bus) and the room cosy. <br/>Breakfasts are delicious and furnished! <br/>It was a pleasure to stay at Joke's and we would definitely come back for our next time in Amsterdam!

3827593,"This place is a gem. Originally Diewert made arrangements for me to leave my bags super early but my plans changed and he accommodated my changes without hesitation. I did not get to meet Diewert personally because I'm a only in the room to sleep kinda person and my trip was short but he checked in with me via text and even sent his friendly neighbor over to be his local ambassador information guide. The place is pristine white, the bath modern and clean. Fall asleep to the sounds of gentle water flowing and the  occasional  quacking of ducks or were they swans? My experience with the Dutch locals was marvelous as a first timer in Amsterdam and Diewert's bnb added to my warm happy experience. Btw- he has an nespresso machine which I've never used before but am thinking of buying one myself now after this experience."
3845839,"Marijke has a wonderful place.  Everything is clean and the guest room offers a good deal of privacy from the rest of the apartment.  Javaplein area is one of Amsterdam’s most authentic city neighbourhoods.  I make a point of finding accommodation in Amsterdam-Oost for my regular visits to the city. If you’re new to Amsterdam, take a chance and explore this area.<br/><br/>Thank you, Marijke!"
3883245,Very friendly host. Great place and good location.But the WIFI's too weak that you hardly have the signal in your room.
3894918,The room is not that luxury as is it looks like. Room is small around  10m2 and bathroom is shared with other rooms in the apartment..We couldn't manage to have non boiling shower but anyway. She provides towels and location is nice since its 1 min from train station. She charges 25 euros more for early check-in and late check-out.
3899747,"We had a perfect stay at Caroline's place. The apartment is simple yet cosy. The living room is on the street side, so you can enjoy the view on this charming street. The bedroom is located in the other side overlooking the small and very quiet courtyard.  The surroundings are a perfect balance between trendy / posh / live and peaceful. "
3901455,Rosie was an outstanding host and I would definitely try to stay with her when I come back to Amsterdam.<br/>She helped me plan my day to make sure I got as much as possible out of the city. We had a couple of very nice conversations.<br/>Her husband is also very pleasant to talk with
3907983,"Rogier was a fantastic host, he was very flexible with all the arrangements and communicated regularly leading up to our visit, he was evening willing to meet us at the station.  He left us a nice guide for the apartment and some very good local information.<br/>The apartment is in a great central location very close to Anne Franks house and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westerkerk]. It is a lovely apartment (also huge), and everything was very clean and tidy. <br/>Thanks again Rogier for a fantastic stay in Amsterdam."
3936135,"Superbe accueil! La chambre est adorable, propre et bien située à une vingtaine de minutes à pied du centre ville! Un grand merci à Klaartje qui a été une très bonne hôte: elle a préparé des petites fiches avec les meilleures choses à faire, visiter et déguster à Amsterdam!<br/>Je vous le conseille!"
3966162,"Accueil agréable par la propriétaire qui loge juste au dessus. <br/>Par contre nous avons été un peu déçus par le logement.<br/>Rien à redire niveau propreté mais la chambre est assez petite et il n'est pas très facile d'accéder à la salle de bains (surtout pour mon fils qui dormait dans le canapé-lit du salon). Salle de douche en très bon état et neuve.<br/>Pas de fenêtre dans la chambre (juste un vasistas difficile à ouvrir pour aérer la nuit car le store ne tient pas bien). <br/>Une généralité aux Pays-Bas (et en Belgique également) : très peu d'occultation des fenêtres (l'architecture locale interdit souvent les volets extérieurs il est vrai...). Mais difficile de dormir le matin avec la lumière du jour !<br/>La cuisine est équipé à son stric minimum mais tout à fait acceptable.<br/>Le jardin n'était pas très agréable car d'ancien meubles probablement destinés à être retirés trônaient... Peut-être la pluie a t-elle accentué notre mauvais ressenti... ? Bref, un peu déçus..."
3971394,"The boat of Juul and Iris is the best place to spend several days in A'dam for next reasons:<br/>- sympathetic and hospitable hosts - ready to help at any time<br/>- actually it's a separate apartment with kitchen and bathroom<br/>- the apartment is located almost in the city center (about 20 minutes by walking and 5-10 min by tram)<br/>- it's really very cozy place where there is all you need - all kitchen stuff, TV, fresh and clean linen, towels, hairdryer (!!!) and WI-FI, also you can rent bikes<br/><br/>We rested in November, so I'm afraid that it will be cold to live on a boat, but on the boat there are heater and very warm blankets, so me and my boyfriend felt very comfortable!<br/><br/>If you are planning to visit Amsterdam, I highly recommend staying on this boat!<br/>Juul and Iris, thank you very much!"
3988016,"Tutto come ci aspettavamo: appartamentino piccolo ma molto carino e con tutto quello che serve. Marielle ci ha guidati con precisione e accolti con grande simpatia illustrandoci i dintorni, anche meno noti. Zona molto tranquilla,  ben servita dai mezzi e a 10 minuti a piedi dalla zona dei musei e dal Vondelpark (peccato non avere avuto con noi  tuta e scarpette!)."
3995534,"I really enjoyed my stay in Sjoukje's house. She is a very nice person, she makes her best so you feel at home and enjoy the best of the city. She separated the beds so my mom and I could sleep and even brought a haring and stropewaffles to us. She has a cute and social cat named Naz.<br/>The apartment is clean, has great natural light and full equipped kitchen. It is very easy to get anywhere and as long is Amsterdam, you should rent a bike!"
4033368,Everything went great. Thanks for a fantastic stay. Amazing house at an amazing location fantastic place. We loved it. 
4035802,"Great Host, very welcoming and helpful. Nice room and facilities. And very flexible: we were allowed to leave our stuff the Whole day, Even After checkout. Breakfast around the corner was delicious. We can Really recommend staying there<br/>"
4053940,"Merci Hein pour ton appartement et tes conseils. <br/>Appartement parfaitement situé d où on peut aller à pied dans toute la ville.<br/>Petit cocooning.<br/>Je le recommande fortement "
4087603,Friendly hosts with a nice place in a perfect location with Yummy Breakfast in a cool nearby location.
4144163,"We had an amazing time at Arjan's and Prema's apartment. The neighborhood was really nice, the apartment is located close to RAI congress center, which is great if you're attending conferences there. Although we only got to meet the hosts on the day of our departure, they were extremely friendly and so much fun to be around. Plus, the dogs are too cute. Would definitely recommend it if you want to feel the Amsterdam vibe a bit outside of the city centre. This was our second stay at Prema & Arjan's place and it was as amazing as the first time.  Arjan was super friendly and made sure that we felt at home. The apartment is amazing with stylish decor. It is really close to public transport and is within a walking distance from RAI center, which makes Prema & Arjan's place very convenient for conference stays. We will definitely choose this place for our next visit to Amsterdam. Arjan and Sweatheart are the best! :)"
4164239,"amazing flat and very nice man<br/>the location is superb and the apartment give you just everything you need :) we had a very good experience and ingo was very helpful."
4172075,"Es war großartig! Die Wohnung war wunderschön und sehr sauber, toll gelegen. Mike war sehr hilfsbereit und total nett. Unbedingt empfehlenswert, immer eine Reise wert. Richtig super. DANKE!"
4173897,"Very nice stay. The guesthouse is very well located. The room is clean with view on the street. The area is a bit noisy but it's perfectly fine and makes the charm of the place. <br/>And above all, Edwin is an amazing host who takes care of his guesthouse and his guests :) Lovely house, well decorated and perfect for a quiet weekend in Amsterdam. Not so far from the city center and easily accessible by public transportation.<br/>Bonus: big kitchen and a small garden backyard."
4179704,"Awesome!<br/>We really felt at home there. <br/>Amaaaazing trip, and this apartment helped to make it perfect!!<br/>Mathias is such a nice host, really helpful, close and reliable. He easily shows that ""his house is your house"".<br/>Very good location, close to everything, even walking<br/>Art on the walls, good vibe, beautiful furniture, calm neighbourhood<br/>What else.....<br/>We loved Amsterdam!<br/>"
4185064,"If you're thinking about booking this room, don't hesitate. It is the perfect Airbnb. We loved our stay and Corina is a marvelous host!"
4193658,"Had a great time at Doruk's apartment! Neat clean, very comfortable and spacious, quiet at night but just minutes from bustling hotspots. Surrounded by fantastic bars and cafés - although we didn't meet Doruk, his instructions and info about finding and staying in the flat were simple and easy and checking in and out was a breeze. Highly recommended to anyone visiting Amsterdam!"
4200684,"Mijef is so warm and hospitable, and the house is lovely! She is quick and responsive, and very helpful with questions we had."
4215446,Appartement agréable et très bien placé !
4220730,"Mirjam is a lovely lady who immediately got in touch with me, after I made my booking and gave me some very useful information about Amsterdam and how to get to her place. It was very easy to find too, a few minute walk to Central Station. She was also very welcoming. As a lot of houses in Amsterdam, Mirjam's flat is very narrow, on the second floor in a walk up building. So if you have heavy luggage, realise it won't be easy to carry your luggage up the narrow staircase. I stayed in the room with my 2 teenager daughters, so when the couch is converted to a bed, there is not much room to move about. The coffee/tea facility is a nice addition and the coffee of very decent quality. We encounter extremely hot weather that night, and could not leave the window open because of the noise, so quiet the room is only when you keep the windows shut. I cannot compare with other places in Amsterdam, but I found that the price is very high for just a room of that size, the quality of the shower facility (decent but not great) and the location, right next to the Red light district. "
4230968,"I had a lovely and friendly communication with Toetsie during the booking process and prior to my arrival.<br/>Toetsie was away during my stay, so unfortunately, I didn't get to meet her, but her housemates Angelo and Theresa met and greeted me. They were friendly and nice and made me feel very welcome. The house is located in a quiet and green area of Amsterdam, only one train stop from Amsterdam Centraal. I was actually 'upgraded' into a bigger room in the house, as it was empty, so they said ""Why not give her a bigger room?!"" :) Even though I stayed for only one night, I enjoyed Toetsie's artsy house with many quirky details. Breakfast and gratis shower products were a huge plus. It's obvious Toetsie cares a lot about her guests!"
4237224,"My wife Shruti and I decided to ""go Dutch"" by meeting in Amsterdam for Diwali (I flew in from San Francisco and she from Mumbai with our 16 month old son). This was our fist time in Amsterdam and first time using AirBnB.<br/><br/>Ingo was extremely kind and helpful through our stay. He was always available. He arranged a baby cot, baby chair and toys for Kanav, which were most useful. He left us maps, detailed instructions, the coffee machine and his Macbook, all things useful. His attention to detail as a host was excellent.<br/><br/>The apartment is located perfectly along the famous Singel canal, blocks away from Spui square, the flower market, a grocery store, a nice church and the shopping district. And yet the place was quiet and not in the hustle-bustle of all these busy places. A few good restaurants next door/across the street and a nice cafe with home-made waffles.<br/><br/>All and all, a happy experience. Would highly recommend Ingo and his home.<br/><br/>kashyap"
4239665,"I felt like at home, everything is like in the photos and Toetsie is a very good hoster, she gave me some indications about the city, and she had a great detail with me giving me a surprise whem I arrived (wine and juice) her cat is lovely, so sweet. The place around is very good to walk and transportation is so easy,"
4270648,"Matthijs is a wonderful host!!!  (Unfortunately, we didn’t get to meet Francina as she was out of town during our stay.)  The traditional bed is so cute and comfortable and the included bathrobes were such a luxury! Also, of course, the location is perfect!!! We are particularly grateful to Matthijs, because he gives great recommendations (we LOVED Long-Pura!) and also because he was so understanding that we made a mistake with the check out day. He tried to help us find another place (and went out of his way to do so!), helped us with a cab, and was very understanding that we were late in checking out because of our confusion. THEN, as if that wasn’t enough, in our rushing to pack we left an iPod and Matthijis actually dropped it off at our new place since he had the address from when helping us with a cab! We couldn’t BELIEVE his kindness.  This host went very out of his way for us in multiples ways, and we are so, so, so grateful. THANK YOU!!! We will only stay here when we return to Amsterdam! "
4274404,wE enjoyed our stay at the apartment. Mike was very helpful. The area is quiet. The apartment was clean and well equipped. 
4291771,"A wonderful apartment in an amazing area, just beside the historical city center, but away from the masses. Everything as described and with a lovely breakfast in the morning. Peaceful and quiet - and Laura and Arjen are just wonderful hosts. 100% recommended! "
4322937,"My husband and I stayed at Matthijs and Francina's place for only one night but would definitely love to stay longer. Everything was just perfect - the sweet and helpful hosts, yummy breakfast, and sleeping in the traditional (well, almost :) ) Dutch cupboard bed was very comfortable and sooo romantic! Staying at RUST b'n'b gives you a feeling of living the life of this increadible city rather than being just another idle tourist. Matthijs and Francina, thank you for making our first - but not the last! - visit to Amsterdam unforgettable!"
4325492,"I have spent 4 days in Amsterdam with my boyfriend, in Joost's appartment : a beautiful flat in a quiet neightborhood close to everything. The room is super-spacious and the garden is a haven of peace. Joost is welcoming, it was very pleasant to discuss with him !  "
4329336,"Wilma is a very kind host, she made our stay very easy. The check in and check out were perfect. The room is lovely exactly like on the picture The bed and pillows are very confortable. The room and private bathroom were very clean. If i come back to Amsterdam, i'll def. stay there again :-) (I already miss Bonnie, the cat of the house who came to say hello in the morning !)."
4342578,"We loved every minute of our stay in this beautiful family home. Ideally located by Oosterpark and some of the best bars, cafes and restaurants in town. Our little boy couldn't get enough of the Oosterpark paddling pool and playing with the neighbourhood kids in the small square right out front. Everything in the house was so thoughtfully prepared by Amos and Marjan who were a pleasure to deal with. They even gave us a ride to our next destination! Oh and the roof deck is stunning. We didn't want to leave! "
4359623,"Great stay, very nice host and place. Thanks!"
4360496,"Pros: friendly welcome, beautiful room, helpful tips, great location. Very easily accessible from A'dam Central and Zuid, and looks just like the listing. Rosie very kindly sent me away with a loaf of the bread that she noticed I liked so much!<br/><br/>Cons: we had to ask for loo roll, hairdryer (which caused a few problems), extra pillows (there was only one each). The bed is beautiful, but very hard. It's really lovely to have breakfast included, and it was very tasty, but it felt a little like everything was on ration - particularly coffee! Each morning we had to ask for a refill of our small cup. Arrangements for coming down for breakfast were also a little tricky - Rosie came upstairs and knocked on the door which felt not very private (and on one occasion woke us up when we thought breakfast was cancelled and were hoping for a holiday lie-in). Would recommend either offering a more traditional 'B&B' style breakfast service (where guests can choose to come down between set hours, and/or agree in advance which days they would like breakfast) OR not doing it at all and reducing the price of the listing a bit.<br/><br/>So, a slightly mixed review, but all in all we had a lovely time! Thanks Rosie!"
4363326,"Hôte presque toujours absent, ne s'occupe pas de nous, aucune information sur la ville , ses restaurants ou autres endroits à voir.<br/>Studio très petit, aucun fauteuil pour s'assoir, impossible de voir la TV, a moins d'être coucher sur le coté.n'est pas un B&B mais au plus une chambre avec petit frigo et lavabo, salle de bain très petite,<br/>en général, à déconseiller"
4396721,"Edwin is a very fun and easy going host, we've had nice chitchats, and he's kindly helped to look after my suitcase during my trip to Giethoorn.<br/><br/>The apartment locates at the central downtown area, very close to the flower market on the river, which means walking distance to the canals and many attractions in town. The room is clean and comfortable, with everything needed for single travelers who would spend most of the time exploring the city. <br/><br/>If you're a light sleeper, it could be a bit busy outside at night - there's pubs on the same street, but ear bugs would certainly solve the problem. <br/><br/>Visit Edwin if you'll be in Amsterdam, and have fun!<br/><br/><br/>"
4399616,"Vibeke fue maravillosa, muy solidaria, nos ayudo , su casa es hermosa y cómoda y de fácil acceso en otra soporte publico"
4405394,"Rust is a jewel in Amsterdam. The bedroom and bathroom were nice, clean, tidy and the place has a charming ambiance. My mattress was unbelievable comfortable; I slept so good in the bed. The hosts Mathijs and Francina are super friendly and they make you feel at home instantly. The location is perfect, it is near among other things the Dam, so you are in the heart of Amsterdam but still it's super quiet in your room. The street is also very safe. The breakfast from the most cutest bakery ever, is delicious and fresh. I will definitively return to RUST and would recommend it to people visiting Amsterdam for work and/or leisure.<br/>"
4410077,"The first impression was really good. Alex was very nice when we met up the first day. The same evening we realised that the house was freezing and we couldn't find a way to turn up the heating. We had to sleep in our clothes because it was extremely cold. The WiFi did not work and we had to pay €15 to access a paid WiFi zone. The tv signal was not working either. The WiFi and tv were amenities listed on the Airbnb page and it was unacceptable that they were not working. I sent Alex a message about all these problems and told her we couldn't even take a shower because it was too cold and had to go to our friends house to use her shower. She didn't even bother replying. Would not recommend this flat if you want a basic, warm house. "
4425081,Great little apartment (looks just like the photos) with modern amenities and in a fantastic area! The place is literally right across the street from the bus station (bus 197 to/from Schipol Airport) and the bicycle rental place (absolute necessity for exploring the city). Very highly recommended for anyone spending a long weekend or some time in Amsterdam. :-)
4437395,"Vibeke has such a nice, comfortable place with a charming backyard. Her place was perfect for our stay and it was easy to get to central Amsterdam - especially by bike! We didn't get a chance to spend much time with Vibeke, but she was very helpful and hospitable when we did see her. Thanks Vibeke!<br/>"
4441783,"Ella's place was exactly as advertised: a beautiful, well-appointed main floor flat in the middle of De Pijp. The neighbourhood is fantastic and the street is quiet and comfortable. We cooked every day in the modern kitchen and it was a pleasure. Ella's friend, Fred, manages the property and he was super responsive and helpful. We would stay there again in a heartbeat!"
4447701,"Great location!!  The apt. is walking distance from Amsterdam Central train station and just a quick bike ride away from city center.  We had access to bicycles, which took care of all our transport needs.  And most importantly - the hosts are very nice and always there to help you.  For me, that makes a big difference.  Loved the breakfast too.  Thanks again."
4473180,"Excellent location in one of the best neighborhoods in Amsterdam and 20 min. walk from Central Station and Dam Square. Spacious, although with very steep stairs, but that is general in Holland. Decoration vintage excessively but that it is still a matter of taste. We didn't meet the owner for labor issues but, despite that, we were atended properly, allowed us to enter the house before the scheduled time and inquired via email about how we were. The house was clean but perhaps some details -for example, the dirty laundry basket was full. In any case recommended and generally good."
4487032,"Amazing! Great location, very clean and spacious room, comfortable bed and bathroom. Everything was even better than we expected! The host was very friendly. We would love to stay there again! Highly recommended!"
4503218,"We stayed with a group of 6 friends for a long weekend and Femke was very friendly and helpful! She was really convenient with the check-in hours and she prepared some food and beverage for our arrival.<br/><br/>We had a lovely time in this large and light home. The house was beautiful and the beds were really comfy. Also it is conveniently located with cosy restaurants, bars, and a supermarket close to the appartement and 15 minutes from downtown.<br/><br/>We felt like being at home and Hopp, the rabbit, was being our cutie pie for the weekend. It was a pleasure to take care of him and stay in Femke house. We highly recommend Femke house!"
4520092,"Rosie was a lovely and caring host and the room was very quiet and clean. Everything is as described. The house is in a very nice neighborhood with several little restaurants and cafès. Furthermore it is very easy to get there from Schiphol airport. The house is also quite close to the Vondelpark and all the museums. It`s very easy and quick to reach everything by bike or tram from there. I highly recommend this B&B and would definitely book it again! Thanks again for everything, Rosie!!"
4536531,"This is my first time to Amsterdam and using airbnb service.<br/>Edwin was replying my e-mail very fast and answer to my questions.<br/><br/>I arrived with a huge heavy suitcase and Thank God... Edwin was very kind to help and brought it to the room at 3rd floor :D<br/>Sorry for the trouble Edwin, I'm such a newbie with travelling issue ;)<br/><br/>The location: perfect!! right in the middle to everywhere.<br/>A bit noisy after 01:00 am as there are several bars nearby; but it was nothing, compare to the perfect location. <br/>I can easily walk to Dam area, Museums, Shops, Indonesian restaurants, etc.<br/><br/>Sorry I was a bith hurry when leaving your place.<br/>Hope to see you again in my next visit to Amsterdam.<br/><br/>Thanks."
4559832,"Thank you for the welcome, the pleasant, clean and well placed house. However the bed mezzanine is slightly too close to the ceiling and Marijke was not very accommodating for the luggage which we had to put in deposit the day of the departure."
4559910,"Sella's wonderful apartment is conveniently located in walking distance of the city center and right in front of the Foodhallen (a must go!!!). It's a pity we couldn't meet in person but she did everything possible to welcome us, get the keys and some neighborhood tips (thank you and Sander!). Her cat Mano welcomed us with loud purrs and even chilled with us in bed.<br/>Thanks a lot for everything!"
4589054,"Appartement exactly as in the picture! Micha Was really available to for the Keys, gave us advice how to get to his flat. Perfect location to go for a concert in the arena music Hall! Big towels available, Even a Bottle of wine to receive us! Thanks "
4599861,"Joke is a lovely lady to stay with! Location is about a 10 min tram ride to the city center. The tram is literally steps away from the apt. Neighborhood has bars and supermarkets. Very convenient and safe. The room was a pretty spacious and beds were comfy. The rest of the apt was nice and clean including the bathroom. Joke prepared a lovely breakfast for us daily including coffee, juice, yogurt and a variety of bread/pastry with cheese and meat. Definitely enough to kick start your day. She has lots of good tips and advice about the area to share. Had maps for us as well as a breakdown of each tram stop along our tram line and what there was to do/see there. Very helpful!! <br/>I would not hesitate to stay with joke again. We had tons to talk about! "
4610753,"Location, location, location!! So central and so easy to get to/from the airport. We enjoyed our stay at Marja's studio. The studio was cozy and we had everything we needed. Marja kindly provided us with welcoming snacks and beverages, including wine. The bed was comfortable. There are so many restaurants, pubs, clubs and bars in the area. Be aware of that if you are a light sleeper but earplugs were kindly provided ( we didn't use them though). There is a nice place for a decent breakfast ( eggs any style) called Cafe George - just across a canal ( 2 min walk from the studio). All in all our stay was enjoyable.  We had a great stay at Sebastian's studio. It was so easy to get to/from the airport; we loved the neighbourhood- it was only 10 minutes from Central Station by tram. The studio was tiny but it was just perfect for us. Communications with Sebastian were pleasunt before our arrival and during our stay. He gave us some excellent recomendations about local restaurants and places to visit. All in all, we enjoyed our stay. We would stay there again if we happen to return to Amsterdam one day. "
4621660,"J'ai vraiment passé un super séjour à Amsterdam! La maison de Rosie située dans le Sud d'Amsterdam - Amsterdam Zuid - est un bon compromis pour ceux qui aiment à la fois se balader en ville et ceux qui veulent aller plus vers l' Amsterdam Arena (qui se trouve à 25 minutes de la maison transport inclus). En tram on accede tres rapidement au centre ville, l'arret se trouve à moins de 100m de leur maison.<br/>La chambre etait tres bien, le lit confortable. La salle de bain tres propre. Le quartier est plutot calme et on trouve pas mal de commerces à proximité (presse, starbucks coffee, supermarché...). Le petit déjeuner servi est tres bon!<br/>Merci encore à Rosie et sa famille pour leur accueil chaleureux. Toujours à disposition!<br/>A une prochaine fois peut etre! Cheers"
4643099,"Not so close from the center. There is the strict minimum furnitures, ok for couple days."
4653510,We stay in Amsterdam 4 days and it is a wonderful experience. Mirjam is an adorable host. She is very precise both before our arrive because she gives us all the necessary information and also during our stay because she gives us useful advices. The appartment is in a very strategic location: it is in the center of the town (you can easily reach all the attactiveness of the city) and it is near the central station. The appartment is exactly as we saw in the photos uploaded here and it is very quiet.
4663644,"Great Appartement in a great hood with a market and a street food hall directly nearby. Noor is the perfect host, fast and friendly communication. We would love to come back again! Alles bestens, vielen Dank. Wir waren noch nie im Norden von Amsterdam und hatten hierfür eine tolle Basisstation :)"
4664762,"Where to start ? <br/>The owner : Firstly i'd like to mention that Marijke is a really nice and welcoming person ; we havent personally met (her daughter did the keys handing) and only exchange over mails and texts but she has been very helpfull . <br/>the area : very close to train station wich takes you in no time to amsterdam central ; lovely little streets , looking exacly like you would expect amsterdam to look like . <br/>The room : we stayed not long so we think it was big enought for 3 guests but wouldnt imagine to stay for to long . Keep in mind that it is a share bathroom . <br/>The night : probably the down side of the whole experience ; being honest none of us managed to sleep at al during the night, somebody took theyr shower at 2am(next to the bedroom) and then tumble dryer on around 3am(again next to bedroom) ; door banging and things floors droped , everytime a door in the house would open close or move our bedroom one would move to and wake us up . <br/>Not even a minute i could close my eyes wich was really anoying and even if the noise would have not been there the light from the street coming in the bedroom was very anoying too; <br/>Im not fassy ; i can sleep pretty much anywhere any time but this time was just impossible. <br/>So i you like you darkness and silence ; forget it <br/>Or maybe we have been unlucky wich is quiet frustrating. <br/>I dont blame mijke and forgive her as she remains really nice . <br/><br/>FRANCAIS : tres mauvaise nuit avec beaucoup de bruits jusqua 3h du mat ; seche linge , douche etc juste a coté de la chambre . Il sagit dune salle de bain partagée ce qui nest pas pratique . <br/>Autrement la maison est bien placé, tres proche de la station vous amenant dans le centre en moin de deux et la proprio tres sympa .<br/>Si vous aimer le calme oublier <br/>Si vous y aller juste pour la proximité cet endroit est parfait ."
4666442,"The location is perfect, in one of the best area of Amsterdam and the apartment is cozy and it is in a lovely neighbourhood, but the cheery on top is the Super Super Super Host Lucie. Thanks so much for the warm welcome and for the tips to enjoy the city. The coffee machine was a great benefit for an Italian family :). At last, but not less important, thanks to Veronica (the cleaner) for coming just to help me to get back my mobile left in the apt. after the check out.  Really recommended host, house and city. "
4674383,"Hans' apartment was in a great location and super convenient for all the things we wanted to do in the city. It's located on a beautiful street and is decorated in a nice modern way. The only downside was that the house wasn't as clean as we would have liked - there were dirty towels and hairs in the wardrobe! Other than that, it was great. "
4677771,"The listing and host(s) were both great -- better than advertised.  Fabulous location and easy access to all public transportation.  Viola and Daniel both met us at the apartment to show us around and provide sightseeing and Amsterdam tips and information.<br/><br/>The apartment is on the second floor (Euro standard) and up some quirky, tight steps, but certainly part of the experience!  Apartment is full of light; great canel views; close to grocery shopping; everything worked perfectly."
4678867,"Sella was a wonderful host! I had to find a place last minute and she was quick to respond. The apartment is perfectly located right outside the city center, in a cute and quiet neighborhood. It's close to all the great bars and restaurants, and there's a wonderful market that goes on right below the apartment. The apartment has great light and everything else you could possibly want/need including a cute back patio with a table and chairs (perfect for reading or hanging with a glass of wine). I highly recommend this spot and plan to stay here next time I'm in Amsterdam! "
4683443,Wir wurden von Viola & Daniel sehr zuvorkommend und herzlich empfangen. Die Wohnung ist wie beschrieben sehr sonnig und hell.  Sie ist mit allem Nötigen ausgestattet. Die Gegend ist ruhig und recht zentral. Wir fühlten uns sehr wohl. 
4688556,Merle apartment is 15 minutes walk from downtown. In the photos I thought there were two rooms but there are only that. The apartment was clean. La maison est conforme aux photos donc spacieuse et entretenue. Les propriétaires ont été très accueillants. Une ligne de tram est proche de la maison. Je recommande ! 
4693022,"Viola & Daniel were the best hosts! They were VERY quick to respond to any questions we had, they provided us with many options of restaurants and places to visit. Their home were absolutely beautiful and perfectly located in the heart of everything we needed during our stay. I will definitely be back to visit again! Thank you so much for everything! :)"
4755106,"It is an excellent located apartment in the heart of Amsterdam. It is very cozy and lovely to stay in and you are surrounded with nice coffee-places, shops and Restaurants – and the very best fruit-juice-bar «Dr. Blend» is just next door! <br/><br/>Thank you very much for the excellent host... Best"
4771181,"David provided an excellent, well located, quiet room very near the train station. From his initial greeting, he answered all our questions and provided large breakfasts.  He even met a special food request of ours!  We highly recommend staying with David while in Amsterdam."
4777220,"My family came to visit me in Amsterdam and stayed at the apartment of Sheryl - and they absolutely loved it! It was a gorgeous, spacious and stylish place where they really felt at home for the duration of their stay. Sheryl was really friendly in all communications, and it made our family trip fantastic. The climbing wall was a real hit too! Thanks so much for having us!"
4782818,"Vanessa very early on let me know that she would not be able to welcome us herself but she ensured that we were very well taken care of. When we arrived she had left us a very handy list of things to do and some excellent restaurant recommendations (and some of my favourite chocolate as a welcome gift :) ). The apartment itself is a magnificent example of modern architecture and furnishing, truly an exceptional place to stay right on one of the pretty, somewhat off the beaten tourist track, canals. The place has excellent access to public transit (tram line 3 goes around the city, the bus to central station comes every five minutes). The place is wonderful for people with two kids but a couple who'd like to have a bit of extra place would very much enjoy this apartment as well.  "
4821496,"We had a wonderful time in Nicolet's apartment. This is a big studio apartment with room to spread out. She has it set up really well with everything a family will need for a comfortable stay. I even used her very powerful blow dryer while there, which sure beat my travel dryer I had packed. The furnishings and beds are very comfortable. The location is great and close to many things. My twelve year old said this was her favorite out of all the places we stayed. Thanks, Nicolet"
4835972,"    I think I've fallen in love with the city of Amsterdam! What a great experience my boyfriend and I had staying two nights here in Debby's lovely guest room. <br/>    First off, the apartment is located about a 25-30 train/tram ride from Schipol. The public transportation is very easy to use, but we chose to walk the majority of the trip. The Museumkwartier is only about a 10-15 min walk, and downtown is only about a 15-20 min walk. I personally preferred staying in the area Debby's apartment was because it was the perfect balance of conveniently close to everywhere you would need/want to go while being just far enough away from all the hustle and bustle of downtown. I was really digging the local vibe, not to mention the fresh market 'Katemarkt' right down the street. There's also what used to be a tram depot which has a hip food court called Foodhallen, where you can get all types of freshly prepared food.<br/>    The actual apartment itself is just as pictured. Comfortable bed, nice bathroom, big tub, TV, microwave, we especially enjoyed the Nespresso coffee maker for the mornings and the water bottles Debby kindly supplied in the mini fridge. She also supplied us with maps and information about the city. I would recommend this BnB to anybody that is traveling alone or with one other person and who are looking for a place to crash for a couple days to explore the city. All and all we enjoyed our stay and look forward to visiting again."
4848419,Matthijs is a very gracious host.  He was very welcoming and gave us good recommendations for restaurants and excursions to do.  The apartment is very cozy and very centrally located but on a nice quiet street.     I wish our vacation was longer so that we could have stayed longer there!! Thanks for your hospitality!!
4855062,"El sito es ideal para visitar Amsterdan y sobretodo si vas en coche, ya que tienes aparcamiento delante de la casa y si quieres llegas al centro  de Amsterdan sin coche tienes un autobús que te lleva hasta la estación central en menos de 15 minutos.<br/>Son dos habitaciones y el desayuno te lo da el dueño que vive en el piso de arriba.Es muy agradable nos resulto un poco especial ya que nunca habíamos tenido una casa compartida.<br/>Es muy recomendable para visitar unos días Amsterdan."
4856527,"Love the location of this studio in the center of Amsterdam. Matthijs & Francina were great hosts, very friendly & helpful! I would definitely return."
4883556,"Bop and Eveline were very lovely, we were greeted warmly and the studio was perfect. Comfortable bed, everything very well equipped and clean, wonderful view. Gateway to exit the boat was narrow, but we quickly got used to walk on it. We would love to return to this houseboat and thanks to Bop and Eveline for their hospitality."
4941090,"Ik heb er lang over gedacht of ik dit wilde schrijven, maar wil je verbeteren dan heb je feedback nodig; het was jammer dat de host waarover zoveel goede dingen geschreven werd niet aanwezig was maar een kamergenoot van het geheel. Deze kamergenoot deed erg zijn best, maar naar ons idee meer omdat het opgedrongen was dan dat hij er zelf plezier uit ontleende. Jammer en voelbaar.<br/>De locatie was schitterend en het bed meer dan fijn, maar de wc was erg vies. Toen ik hierover een tip gaf om de wc schoon te maken werd dit erg beleefd ontvangen en zou worden schoongemaakt. Dit heb ik niet kunnen ontdekken helaas. Natuurlijk is een mannen huishouden anders dan die van vrouwen, met name als het gaat om wc-brillen, maat toch...<br/>Van wc naar ontbijt. Op zondag zou onze oorspronkelijke host aanwezig zijn voor ons (eerlijk is eerlijk) fantastische koffie en ontbijt, maar helaas voor de huisgenoot was de host niet op tijd. Hierdoor schoot huisgenoot toen hij zijn wekker hoorde vanuit zijn boxershort in zijn spijkerbroek en zonder een washand te gebruiken ook in zijn reeds gedragen T-shirt. Het zou op zijn minst prettig zijn geweest als wij dit niet hadden opgemerkt. Zonder je handen te wassen een ontbijt serveren vind ik ongepast.<br/>Goed, nu lijkt alles nogal negatief, maar nogmaals de huisgenoot deed op zijn manier erg zijn best, het bed was heerlijk, de locatie fantastisch en het ontbijt op zaterdag heerlijk vers en warm. Daar werden wij dan weer warm van.<br/>Alle feedback is niet om te klagen maar ik denk wel belangrijk om te weten. Op basis ban bovenstaande zou ik niet terugkomen en dat terwijl ik vaak in Amsterdam verblijf. Uiteraard wens ik jullie alle goede voor de toekomst!<br/>Groetjes Daphna"
4941305,"Rosie was incredibly accommodating to my late check-in time. The location is really convenient, and she provided every amenity that I needed (including super fast wifi!). I would definitely stay with her again. Great neighborhood!"
4949082,"Elmar was a good host, helpful... Listing as claimed...Excellent location with elevator which is rare... and private parking!"
4973021,Nice place and great host
4976423,"Amazing experience! Toetsie was very kind, she gave us the house keys that was perfect to know the city without problem of time. When we arrived we found bread, towels, a bottle of wine, juice in our bedroom and in the fridge there were others things. The house was clean and quite near to the center, we could take the train, metro or bus and if you want you can go to the center walking for 20 or 25 minutes. All the experience was very positive! Her place is large, bright, clean and gorgeous. Toetsie was very friendly and attentive to all questions and recommendation. I absolutely recommended and if i come back i don't have any doubt to stay there again. Thanks for all Toetsie!!"
4992876,"Matthijs was an absolutely AMAZING host! Not only did he offer my friends and I a warm welcome to Amsterdam, but he also went above and beyond to make our stay as comfortable as possible. He was our personal tour guide and organized breakfast for us at an incredibly delicious restaurant that was very close to the BNB. I definitely recommend staying with Matthijs to anyone who wants a comfortable and relaxing environment to come home to after a long day site-seeing in beautiful Amsterdam. His BNB is very close to Central Station (about a 10 minute walk). Thank you Matthijs for a wonderful stay!! Matthijs is an absolutely wonderful host!!! I would definitely recommend him to anyone who wants a fun and relaxing trip to Amsterdam!! "
5013818,"Het contact verliep steeds snel en efficiënt. Manon en Claudio waren zeer vriendelijk en hulpzaam. Hun huis was zeer ruim, netjes en aangenaam. De locatie is goed bereikbaar met het openbaar vervoer. De gratis parkeerplaats is een meerwaarde! Het huisje was zeer rustig en kalm. Dichtbij is een supermarkt, Jumbo en andere winkels. De woning van Manon is gelegen in Amsterdam Noord, een rustig gebied, geen zatte toeristen... Je vindt er een Albert Heyn, Jumbo,... Met de bus, taxi, uber geraak je snel naar het centrum. Er zijn heel wat fijne eetplekken in Amsterdam Noord. De woning is proper en bevat alles wat je nodig hebt. Er is zelfs gratis parkeerplaats! De communicatie loopt steeds snel, correct en aangenaam met Manon."
5014140,"We had a great time in Amsterdam staying at this cute apartment, which is on a very quiet canal-side street that is located an easy distance from the Central train station--there is a tram that takes you about a five minute walk from the apartment, or you could walk it easily if you don't have too much luggage. It was also extremely easy to walk into the central area of the city. Arjan and Laura were great hosts, friendly and helpful, and they provided a generous, nice breakfast every morning. Great place to stay. "
5020318,Gerard and Joke were the most hospitable Airbnb guests I've ever had. They made me instantaneously feel welcomed and they opened up their home to me as if it were my own. I highly recommend a stay at their house boat for an authentic Dutch local experience in a quiet and safe neighborhood. 
5040395,"Bella la casa in una zona residenziale molto ben fornita dai mezzi pubblici,accogliente e colorata,perfetta per una coppia con figli. Tramite la linea del tram n. 4,a 10 minuti da casa,è possibile raggiungere il centro in poco tempo."
5053889,"Joris is an amazing host. He helped us out with so many questions about the area and travelling around Amsterdam before we even left our home. His house is clean, comfortable and extremely convenient to restaurants, museums and boat tours. We were so jet-lagged that we could easily walk back to the house in the middle of the day for a nap and walk back to town later in the evening. We only used public transportation from and to the airport, rest was on foot for a couple of days from this house. We missed a connecting flight and ended up in Amsterdam a day late. Joris was extremely thoughtful to leave a beautiful bunch of flowers on the table, and juice and a cake in the refrigerator to welcome us and make us feel better. Thanks Joris, we truly appreciate your kindness.<br/>Rekha and Gulshan"
5092759,"Ich habe alles,  wie versprochen vorgefunden. Mein Gastgeber war sehr höflich und zuvorkommend. Er war auch vor Reiseantritt für Fragen erreichbar und hielt unsere Verabredungen ein.<br/>Das Zimmer war geschmackvoll eingerichtet und super sauber. Alles Notwendige war vorhanden.  Für einen Aufenthalt in Amsterdam meine I. Wahl! Auf diesem Wege noch einmal herzlichen Dank!"
5096070,"Nice houseboat. Two floors + sunroof. One bedroom is large enough, another - a bit small for two persons.<br/><br/>A bit far from center, but Harry provided bikes for us, so it wasn't a problem.<br/><br/>New experience.<br/><br/>Overall impression - 4+/5"
5122268,"Mirjam's place is great. The room is spacious, warm, and quiet. Even though your'e sharing the toilet & shower with her, it's all kept very clean, and she goes out of her way to give you privacy. It's like having your own apartment.  Location wise, it's very close to the red light district and nieuwmarkt, but it's located in a quiet residential street which lets you have the central location without the noise and tourists. If there's heavy rain, the windows can get a bit noisy, but there were earplugs in the drawer. Great planning.<br/><br/>Everything was very clean, quiet, safe, and within walking distance."
5132512,"Ester was very accommodating, very friendly and very responsive.  The neighborhood put us in close proximity to any place in Amsterdam we wanted to visit.  Having access to Ester's bikes was essential, and allowed us to easily navigate the entirety of Amsterdam.  <br/><br/>The apartment was spacious, stocked with bottled water, snacks and wine, hair dryers and extra little toiletries you may have forgotten.  There is a small kitchen and cookware, which was also nice.  While there is no air conditioning, due to the time of year we visited, that was not a problem.  Our only complaint was a rushing pipe/banging noise that would occur with some regularity and appeared to be associated with the use of hot water.  "
5165610,We visited Amsterdam for 3 days and staying with Willem and Sipke (and Puma) was the perfect choice. The house is ideally situated on Prinsengracht: near to every 'hotspot' but not in the middle of the touristy bustle. The room is absolutely beautiful and comfortable. Willem is a wonderful and pleasant host making sure that you feel quite at home and providing information on good places to go/eat/enjoy. 
5170303,"L'appartement est sublime et décoré avec beaucoup de gout ! La situation est idéale, la vue sur les canaux... tout est parfait ! <br/>"
5173148,"Heerlijk geslapen in de eenpersoonskamer die Toetsie verhuurt. Verder is er een kleine keuken en een lekkere douche die je deelt als er mensen zijn die de twee persoonskamer huren. Tevens is er een gezellige zitkamer aanwezig, dus ruimte zat. Toetsie is een goede gastvrouw, er ligt een fles wijn klaar, er liggen heerlijke biologische producten in de koelkast voor het ontbijt, sinaasappelsap, koffie, thee etc klaar. Aan alles is wel gedacht.<br/>Het huis van Toetsie ligt centraal in Amsterdam. Amsterdam-Oost is in ieder geval niet overlopen door massa’s toeristen, gewoon echt Amsterdam, maar met de metro of tram ben je ook zo in het centrum. Verder moest ik in Zuid-Ost zijn, ben je ook erg snel vanuit het huis van Toetsie.<br/>Helaas zijn Toetsie en ik elkaar misgelopen, maar de communicatie met Toetsie verloopt uitstekend. Snelle mailwisseling, duidelijke sleuteloverdracht. Al met al, prima. DOEN."
5195739,"A perfect stay in Amsterdam. Mike's place is fantastic, opposite a beautiful park and surrounded by many cool bars and restaurants. The amenities are as described with a very comfortable bed, eating space, lovely kitchenette with toilet/shower-room. Very modern and clean with some nice touches! <br/><br/>The flat is small but perfectly formed and Mike is a considerate and laid back host. I highly recommend this place for a stay in Amsterdam.  This was a lovely apartment in a quiet, tranquil area of Amsterdam. From here you can walk around most of the city but it’s not right in the centre so not too busy. There is a tram and buses nearby for easy access to major sites. Thank you for a lovely stay."
5205171,"C'était très bien. <br/>La propriétaire est très sympa et agréable.<br/>Le petit déjeuner était delicieus.<br/>Je veux savoir le nom de fromages, c'était très bon :)<br/>La chambre est calme et claire.<br/>Grace à vous, on a passé très bonnes vacances.<br/>Merci :)<br/>"
5215630,Lora was a great host and easy to get in touch with to coordinate details of our stay. If you're looking for a place that feels like it's your own private space while being in someone else's home then this place is for you. The only issues we had is that we had trouble communicating with Lora while staying at her place and needing a few things. Messaged her on Airbnb since we didn't have a local phone plan and weren't able to get responses from her. Also not sure why but the wifi was very unreliable and not working while we stayed there which made it hard since we didn't have local phone plans. 
5227271,"Absolutely the best possible choice for my trip to Amsterdam! <br/>First off, Frits is an amazing host that gave us great recommendations on how to experience the city.   He was a clear communicator and made our checkin as seamless as possible. <br/>The apartment was very clean and had everything we needed. The best part was the location. Nestled in the Jordaan neighborhood, this apartment was near all the great local establishments and away from the hustle and bustle of the touristy areas. <br/>I would highly recommend the place if you want to experience Amsterdam. "
5233529,"Wir sind Fans von Airbnb, haben gute Erfahrungen in Marocco und Istanbul gemacht, die Krönung war jetzt der Aufenthalt auf dem Hausboot von Eef und Bop. Das Appartment auf dem Hausboot ist einfach perfekt und liebevoll eingerichtet. Wir haben uns sehr willkommen gefühlt, deutlich spürbar an dem Sekt, selbstgemachter Marmelade, Milch und Eiern im Kühlschrank. Wir haben die Zeit sehr genossen, auch wenn es in Amsterdam an dem Wochenende viel geregnet hat, dann war es auf dem Hausboot besonders gemütlich, der Regen hat auf das Dach geprasselt und die Enten schwammen vor unserem Fenster vorbei.<br/>Wir werden immer wieder dorthin zurückkommen, Eef und Bop sind einfach wunderbare Gastgeber. Wilhelmine und Rainer aus Köln."
5235172,"Nice and clean appartement very well located in the beautiful Jordaan area. <br/>However We have been Waiting for 1 h for the host to come with the key of the appartement though I have told the person of Iambnb our Time of arrival. We have been Waiting 30 minutes outside the appartement in the cold (very cold). I kept on texting Iambnb That We were Waiting (on WhatsApp so I knew he saw the messaging) but no answer same for my calls. After 30 minutes a person finally called me to say : wait in the café at the corner of the street someone will come with the key in 20 Minutes !<br/>Ok couldn't you just said it 30 minutes'ago we Would not have been frozen outside for nothing. <br/>Then the guy with the key showed up I guess it was the owner as he said he lives upstairs though he dis not introduce himself. So he arrived with no apologies but a :<br/>Are you waiting for me ?<br/> ???<br/>Then he showed briefly the appartement and he left (no apologies for being late, no advice on the neighborhood or restaurant to go as Airbnb host usually do). <br/>And then the first night was horrible. Really We couldn't sleep. At about midnight the owner came home with some friends and We Heard every steps upstairs and then down stairs. <br/>And one of them even started a scooter right under our windows in the middle of the night...<br/>To conclude i would say Nice appartement in a great area, but worst welcome ever compare to the many Airbnb I have stayed in and hard to sleep well because of the noise outside ans inside the house. <br/>"
5244967,"Laura and her husband were extremely welcoming and helpful to us.  Check in was smooth, and they even offered us a beer while we filled in then forms.  We asked for a dinner recommendation, and were so surprised when Laura took us to the restaurant in her car.  The food was fantastic too!  <br/>The location of this property is extremely convenient and the spaciousness of. The apartment was wonderful.  I liked not having to climb a steep staircase, only a few steps down and you are in the apartment (which has the best shower!!!!).  The bed is also very comfortable.<br/>My only negative feedback is the sound from people going back and forth upstairs can be a little noisy first thing in the morning. And the pump for the water is in the wall of the apartment - this is also a bit noisy,  but it only comes on intermittently.  Both these issues are minor, but for the sake of completeness I mention them.  It certainly would not deter me from staying with Laura and Arjan again!"
5251476,"Wouter answered to my request very quick and was in touch in any questions. He is very nice and frendly - helped us with luggage (no lift there!), told about area, gave some advices about nearest cafe, shops, bike rentals etc. and also presented one bottle of wine, as ""welcome"", thanks!<br/>The flat is not in center, but quite near: to Central Station is about 40 minutes by foot, to main places it takes from 10 till 20 minutes. We prefer walking, but you can use tram, the station is near. <br/>Very quiet neighborhood and nice market 5 minutes away from flat with fresh fruits, vegetables and flowers! <br/>This flat is better for short stay, cos there are not enough place for your things and clothes (Wouter usually lives here, so there are many his things, of course). But all was really clean and kitchen is well equipment, if you like cooking.<br/>Two notes - there is a small dragon, he is really quiet, but I felt some specific smell from it (not bad, just specific). And it was a little cold for me, I think because of windows (big and quite old), but this is usual problem for Europe in spring.<br/>So, it was nice time in Amsterdam, thanks!"
5269442,"Gerard is a very nice person to meet. Everything went well and communication was uncomplicated. The room was really nice, clean, cozy and centrally located. We would definitely recommend Gerard as your host for your trip to Amsterdam!"
5269902,"We had a wonderful time in Marre's home.  Our 7 month-old son loved all of the toys and the comforts of the baby's bedroom.  The home was clean, comfortable and in a fantastic location.  Marre was accessible via email and phone for any problems (which there were none) and overall, we had a wonderful stay.  I would recommend this home for anyone looking for an easy place to stay with children.<br/><br/>"
5277268,"We loved our stay in Amsterdam and Martin's flat. The flat is spacious, modern and equipped with everything you might need. Martin is very good host and well organised and replies very quickly to any questions or messages. The flat is very well located and we really felt like we experienced Amsterdam. The only thing I may say is that as it clearly states smoking is allowed, if you are non-smoker, you really do smell the smoke in the flat no matter how much you air it out. That being said the flat is very clean and tidy."
5277320,"We hebben genoten van ons dagje Amsterdam! <br/>En het was heerlijk dat we in de B&B bij Matthijs konden overnachten. De B&B is midden in het centrum gelegen en ondanks dat is het heerlijk rustig in het huis. Het ontbijt bij "" De laatste kruimel"" was heerlijk en bijzonder! De volgende keer ga ik weer kijken  of ik bij Matthijs kan blijven logeren, groetjes Riena Heel leuke centrale plek aan de Herengracht! Heerlijk rustig, geen autoverkeer in de straat! Wel geweldig uitzicht op de gracht waar de bootjes rondvaren. De ruimte is mooi en van alle gemakken voorzien! Wij hebben een geweldig lang weekend gehad. <br/>Roel en Riena"
5280890,"Had such a lovely stay at this beautiful apartment. Job was a very good host, meeting us late after our flight with drinks and treats. Even calling us a taxi back to the airport. <br/><br/>The area was perfect with lots of bars and restaurants, especially the nine streets for shopping! Would 100% come back and stay was a home away from home for the weekend. "
5296148,"Perfect house, beautiful experience thanks to Roland home. I recommend it to everyone. Clean and welcoming. TOP!!"
5300239,"Johan's place was the perfect stopover spot for us to recover from jetlag en route from US to Tanzania. It was our very first airbnb stay and we loved it. We wished we had booked it for our stopover on the way home a few weeks later, too. We spent a lot of our two days lounging comfortably in the gorgeous, bright and airy room, giant windows open. The internet connection was good, able to video chat with family back home. The neighborhood is nice, we took the tram there with all of our bags from the airport but otherwise walked everywhere. It's especially convenient for the museums and Vondelpark, but nothing's very far. There's a tiny restaurant on the corner run by Johan's friend, food looked amazing, but she books up a week in advance. She said she only cooks a set amount until food is gone and then she's done for the day. See about getting a reservation, it looked so fresh and expertly prepared. Hopefully we'll get there next time. We didn't pick the best restaurant choices in the vicinity, so do a little research and you'll have better luck. We were too tired to walk very far or think too hard about it. Thanks for a great stay! Cute room with a comfortable bed. The hosts were very friendly and helpful, and took our bags for us when we arrived before the room was ready. Great location, right in the center of things, we walked everywhere and had very good luck with nearby restaurants (Hotel V and de Kerkwijk were great, the breakfast place that's included is really cozy and cute.) The room was smaller than we expected, but we just hung out on the bed when we were there, which was very inviting. The internet connection is very weak in the room, so don't count on it if there are things you need/want to get done online. It was surprisingly quiet at night in the room despite being near all the action. "
5331610,"Great, clean apt in really cool part of town. I think of the neighborhoods we explored, De Pijp may have been our fave (as it was less of a coffeeshop/touristy locale and more of a local, hip vibe). The bed is super comfy, the kitchen has literally all the appliances you need, and the bedroom itself is well decorated/refreshing to come home to. The bathroom is a tad small, but might be typical for Amsterdam. Would def stay here again."
5331916,Very fine apartement in a lovely part of the City. Simon was the perfect invisible host
5333891,"В Амстердаме надо обязательно жить на лодке и ездить на велосипеде. ""Тасмания"" -- идеальный вариант.<br/>Хозяева гостеприимные и радушные. Комната очень светлая и уютная, есть все необходимое. Вдобавок -- велосипеды на всё время проживания, что очень упрощает перемещение по городу. <br/>Удобное расположение: до Центрального вокзала 25 минут пешком, 10 -- на велосипеде. Поблизости есть несколько ресторанов и магазинов.<br/>Мы отлично провели время на ""Тасмании"". Всем рекомендуем."
5363912,Mirjam is a super nice lady who was super helpful in providing maps and gave good recommendations on where to go. The room is very cute and my two friends and I were able to sleep there comfortably. The free towels and coffee/tea was also a nice touch :)
5386407,"Yahav is so nice and kind that I feel uncomfortable writing what bothered me staying there, really! Location is superb, easy to reach, bikes are great. Place is spotless clean.<br/><br/>This is what some other guests wrote as well, so I agree with following: guest room is actually very small and what you see in the photo above the bed is actually a boiler (thought t was closet) so it's very noisy because it is heating for the house and it turns on every now and then, while you try to sleep. Walls are thin also. My mistake I didn't ask what it was. And I didn't ask for bathroom photo as well, which is tiny and not very nice. Taking off shoes at the entrance makes you feel at home really, but the floor is so cold and would be nice if there was a carpet on the floor or some slippers available for guests. I paid almost 100$ with fees for this room for 2 guests, maybe that's why my expectations were a bit higher.<br/><br/>I would recommend Yahav's place, he's a great host!"
5418343,"Nous avons passé un excellent week-end à Amsterdam, l'appartement est très agréable, très beau, il correspond exactement à la description, dans un beau quartier calme. L'hôte était facilement joignable pour toutes questions ou pour récupérer les clés. Très bonne expérience. "
5430924,"Loved our stay at the house, very central but extremely quiet. Breakfast was amazing at the pastry shop aswell, great value for money.<br/>Would recommend to anyone in Amsterdam.<br/>Sam"
5462370,De ontvangst was een ervaring op zich. We hebben erg leuke tips gekregen en Kris kras door het fantastische Amsterdam gelopen. De studio is bijzonder en met smaak gemaakt en ingericht. Als je met twee bent moet je wel van mekaar houden gelet op de grootte. De plek is perfect! Dichtbij de metro en op loopafstand van prachtige plekken. Zeker een aanrader!
5478528,"Wytse should probably be an ambassador because he provided such a great welcome to Amsterdam. He was kind, friendly, professional and very helpful.<br/><br/>The apartment is nice and centrally located. It was very relaxing to come home to each night.<br/><br/>The shower/bathroom situation is a little funky- specifically you need to enter it through one of the bedrooms but that's very minor. The shower is a little awkward but full of hot water and still really nice. And let's face it, you're not here to rate showers.<br/><br/>Couches are comfy. Beds are warm and comfy. Radiators are silent. Bedrooms are quiet. The house and neighborhood are both safe and clean. It worked out perfectly for us."
5512206,"O apartamento não é igual à foto. É muito melhor, porque a foto não transmite sensações. É simplesmente fantástico. Excelente localização, limpo, cama confortável, cozinha super equipada, além de ter máquina de café expresso. Banheiro com produtos que não conhecia e depois que experimentei, fui até a loja comprar alguns para mim. O Ingo é uma graça de pessoa. Super atencioso, gentil e muito prestativo nas nossas dúvidas. Sem dúvida eu recomendo o apartamento. Só espero que, com tanto elogio, o Ingo não aumente o preço (risos)."
5517831,Corina was very nice and helpful. She even changed her schedule so we could do an early checkin. She also has plenty of good tips (mostly the restaurants we've been checking out *very* successfully). Shower and bed are as good as claimed by prior customers. The room was a bit cold - though this was our fault as we simply forgot to ask about the heating and only found the small heater in the corner instead of the big and cozy one. We enjoyed our stay and can really recommend the place - the location is really perfect for Amsterdam City trips.
5527049,"Laura and Arjan were magnificent hosts and did everything to make our stay comfortable. Helping solve an issue of an extra night letting us into the attic bedroom with use of their house as they were away that night. So trusting! A canal trip on their motor boat, a lovely welcome bottle of Argentinian red, assistance with getting our bikes to the airport and delightful breakfasts delivered to our basement flat every morning. Such a happy family who are clearly in love with their lovely city and wish to share it with their guests. Cannot recommend this enough!!"
5552064,"Nous (5 filles) avons passé quatre jours à Amsterdam, logées chez Cécile qui a pu nous accueillir (avec le sourire !) malgré notre arrivée bien plus tardive que prévu. L'appartement est chaleureux, les lits sont confortables et le balcon est très agréable le matin lorsqu’il est baigné de soleil. la pièce centrale est bien éclairée, on se sent très vite à l’aise. Ce n’est pas très grand mais bien aménagé donc on y circule sans problème.<br/>Le quartier n'est pas loin du centre ville en tramway. Il y a également un parking P+R à 5 minutes en voiture.<br/>l’arrêt de tram est à un peu plus de 5 minutes à pied de chez Cécile.<br/>on a pris le taxi une fois de nuit, du centre jusqu’à l’appartement : on en a eu pour 25 euros en tout (gros taxi). on a trouvé ensuite un bus de nuit qui passe à l’arrêt à côté de l’appartement (waalstraat).<br/>Le quartier est calme, les voisins sont sympas, il y a de nombreux commerces autour ainsi que des restaurants et des coffeeshop. Cécile nous avait fait une liste détaillée de tous les commerces dont on pouvait avoir besoin !<br/>L’appartement de Cécile est bien équipé (on peut écouter de la musique partout!), il y a tout le nécessaire pour faire la cuisine.<br/>On a été bluffées par l'organisation de Cécile qui nous a facilité notre séjour avec ses nombreuses très bonnes adresses et bons plans!<br/>on a pu ainsi découvrir des adresses pas trop touristiques, c’était parfait (on recommande d'ailleurs la très bonne liqueur d'une des plus anciennes adresses d'Amsterdam (conseillée par Cécile) juste à côté de la place Dam).<br/>On a même eu droit à des chocolats à notre arrivée et Cécile nous avait mis du pain et de la confiture ainsi que des pains au chocolat de côté afin qu'on ait de quoi déjeuner pour le matin... du grand luxe, mieux qu'à l'hôtel !<br/><br/>on s’est senties très à l’aise, pour tout avouer on ne voulait plus partir tant les conditions de ce séjour étaient parfaites…!!<br/>grâce aux indications de Cécile nous n'avons pas perdu beaucoup de temps à se repérer pour prendre les transports, c'était très pratique.<br/>Nous sommes sorties dans des endroits recommandés par elle et nous avons à chaque fois passé de très bons moments.<br/><br/>Malheureusement, il y avait trop de queue pour les musées que nous voulions visiter. pour la maison d’Anne Frank par exemple, l’attente était interminable donc nous avons préféré nous promener le long des canaux du quartier Joordan. nous recommandons de réserver (très) à l’avance la visite de la maison d’Anne Frank sur le site internet.<br/><br/>Sur les recommandations de Cécile (une fois de plus!) nous nous sommes éloignées du centre ville pour aller sur l'autre rive de l'IJ, nous sommes allées déjeuner dans un restaurant (""Kantine"") à la décoration moderne, situé au bord de l'eau. on y accède par bateau, le retour au coucher de soleil reste un de nos très beaux souvenirs."
5559175,"As it says in her profile, a very easygoing person, she is absolutely that. She is well travelled, has some great stories to share and funny. The apartment looks and feels great. Very private and quiet. For someone travelling to Amsterdam and wants to get out of the Dam madness, staying at Cliostraat/Beethovenstraat is a very good option.<br/><br/>And, yes, she brews the best coffee in the world. :)<br/><br/> Very responsive and friendly host. We enjoyed our stay."
5565065,Great comfortable and clean room right on the canal and in the hub of it all!! Not noisy! Great location. 
5572112,"Small but nice and pretty neat room, and a very comfy bed. It is well connected to the centre and to the airport as well, which for me was a plus. I felt very welcome and handy maps and guides were available, and though a bicycle was part of the offer, due to the weather I didn't try it, too bad because it's just a mere 15' pedalling and I love bicycles. Just for that I will come back. Thanks! How fabulous, I instantly loved the place, big garden, quiet environment, beautiful boat house. Marga made feel her guest very welcome, this is definitely a place will be back for longer vacations in Amsterdam. "
5595856,Our stay at Matthijs' place was fantastic.  The location was exactly where you would want to be.  The room was clean.  The towels smelled fresh.  The stay includes a breakfast at a lovely nearby cafe.   Matthijs himself has a great and calm energy.  I wish I had booked a massage with him!  I liked this place very much and would recommend it. 
5601332,"Perfect place & area for a weekend trip to Amsterdam. The apartment is as nice as in the pictures. And Jean-Paul was a great host - helpful & well-informed. Knowing his neighborhood and his city. You can ask him everything... I can especially recommend the bicycle rental next to the apartment (also open on Sundays). There's a bike Autobahn through the Vondelpark all the way to the Paradiso - just takes 10 minutes. And you should try the Indonesian restaurant nearby (the ""Blauw"" one/make a reservation). If we'd stayed longer we'd even been gone to the pub quiz in the Schinkelhaven bar and for a course in the dancing school... "
5603481,"Coen has been very helpful, facilitating our arrival by answering all my questions promptly. <br/>The apartment is great, very well located (De Pijp is super nice), very confortable, very well equiped.<br/>I recommend this host!"
5616024,Great stay just in the heart of Amsterdam. 
5619292,"I did not meet Palmyra, but her friend Komal was extremely kind and accommodating.  I wish I could have spent more time chatting with her!  The apartment was gorgeous and situated in a nice part of Amsterdam...not in the hub of everything but within walking distance. I definitely would recommend Palmrya's place!"
5642063,"Hein is a super nice guy. Gave me a good introduction and whenever I needed him, he was there. I can recommend him as a host! All ok. In my opinion you can’t call it “studio” though. No own kitchen, nor access. No sink to wash dishes... Shower handle was broken and some lights were not working in the bathroom. Very clean overall! Good checkin experience!"
5647630,"Matthijs is super friendly and his Airbnb is very nice, clean, practical and in a great location. I would definitely come back :-)"
5673470,"Thank you Chantal for sharing your flat. I'm glad to have a contact with you. <br/>The flat is really nice and comfortable. It is fully furnished and provides every necessity for short or long term stay. When one returns tired from exploring city all day (or night) he will find a nice place to rest there. And when one go backs from work he will be able prepare meal, pass out before TV and rest for the next challenging day. It's great location (only few minutes from Museum Plein and 4km from Central station) is also a plus. Landlords are really nice and helpful in every situation making the stay unforgettable event.<br/>Once again Thanks for everything:)"
5680454,"Very central location with a warm host. It was good that we could leave our luggage in the flat so that we can simply come back and collect it before our departure! Thanks for a nice hosting, Mirjam :)"
5688461,"Wendie & Hans are very hearty, obliging and helpful. They are right there, if you need something.<br/>To have a little something to eat for breakfast every morning, hanging on the door handle, was really a sweet, welcome surprise.<br/>The flat is comfortable, clean and clear. The small balcony full of colorful flowers gives you the opportunity to relax outdoor.<br/>The location is just perfect: you open the main door and BANG! you are in the middle of the pulsing dutch city - just in centre of everything!<br/>We would come back even ""tomorrow"", if possible... It's just the place to be! Thank you Wendie & Hans to give us a home for a few days.<br/>Whit best recommendations, D & D."
5711529,"The space is really great. It's and artistic loft (as described) and if you are curious about arts (like me) you may find yourself lost in Jan's library. I really liked the location. It is within 10-15 minutes walking distance from the centre, but De Pijp is great with its shops, restaurants, and bars. If you are not looking for the regular tourist attractions, this area is better."
5715463,"Very nice and cozy apartment! Great location, it takes only few minutes to the citycenter and to the nearest sightseeings.<br/><br/>Very friendly welcoming, some basic stuff in fridge. Robert gave us tips and hints about Dam. Robert took care of us through our holiday.<br/><br/>If you arrive by plane to Amsterdam, just take bus number 197 from airport to Robert's and Anke's apartment.<br/><br/>We recommend Robert's and Anke's apartment.<br/>Greetings Kaisa and Joonas"
5719825,"Lovely room in a good location, we could walk to everything we wanted to see and do but if you do want tram it's just on end of street. <br/>Loved my stay in Amsterdam and I would definitely recommend this place :) "
5733551,"the room was cold and the heater is very noisy, so was impossible keep it on during the night. I did not sleep and catched cold!"
5738791,"We had the most wonderful time staying at this delightful apartment in a great neighbourhood of Amsterdam. The apartment was very clean and comfortable. Simone was very sweet and helpful. We needed to find a dentist and she gave us her dentists info, and left us with a lovely welcoming gift.  We really felt at home in this apartment it has a great feel. The location is ideal. Jordan is a great neighbourhood and the apartment is down a quieter neighbourhood street but everything you want to see is within walking distance. We would highly recommend this apartment for anyone coming to Amsterdam. We loved it, great time.  We will definitely try and stay here again when we come back to Amsterdam. "
5771127,"We had a great stay at Vibeke´s place. We felt really welcome, the Room and also the rest of the flat was very cozy, with a lot of nice vintage furniture and Vibeke took time to show us everything in the house and also which busses are best to take and where are good places to go. Also we could use the kichen as much as we wantet and Vibeke was always very helpful if we had questions. It was a really nice atmospehre and we enjoyed our trip and the stay!"
5781069,"I had such a lovely time staying with Rosie. She is such a wonderful hostess- very friendly and really makes you feel at home. Rosie went over and above during my stay- finding me shampoo when I forgot mine and serving me breakfast later on a day when I missed the normal time. I was a little cold one night (I forgot to ask how to turn the heater on!), so Rosie left me an extra blanket and turned the heating on for me the next night, so I arrive back to a warm room.<br/><br/>The room is just as pictured, and really close to Museumplein and Albert Cuypmarkt. It is also incredibly easy to get into central Amsterdam on the tram that is 2 minutes walk from the flat.<br/><br/>Would highly recommend staying with Rosie in Amsterdam!"
5788313,"Perfect weekend, Jeroen is really nice, full of good advices on where to go and what to do. The room is as described and really comfortable. The communication is nice and easy, I really recommend this place! :)"
5795365,"Toetsie was a wonderful host, really helpful and accommodating.  The accomodation and location was perfect for me, and it is situated near a lovely park. Toetsie's roof garden is a wonderful way to spend the evening watching the sun go down.  I highly recommend to all"
5798407,"This stay was just perfect. The room was very clean and perfectly and modern furnished. We missed nothing during our stay. The view is very nice and exactly as you can see on the pics. David was a perfect host and the breakfast was also very good. <br/>The position of the house is the best you can get in Amsterdam. Located 5 min from mainstation within the red light area and 10 min walk to DAM araound 15 min to Anne Frank House. The best, its totally quiet and you will sleep very well. <br/><br/>Really perfect location!"
5814246,"My host presented a lovely, well-equipped and clean apartment, left even fruit for me. The apartment is located in a charming area of Amsterdam and easy to reach. I'll come back!<br/>Maybe the key instructions were a bit ""low key"". The rest: perfect."
5822971,"Freundlicher Check-in,  Zweitschlüssel wäre hilfreich. Kommen gerne wieder."
5824454,"Маленькая но уютная эргономичная квартира. Хороший вид из окна последнего этажа. Доп.плюс - рядом с остановкой автобуса из аэропорта. Минус в квартире было холодновато. Хороший вариант для путешествий вдвоем на несколько дней. <br/>&&&<br/>уже после отьезда выяснилось , что в квартире все же была некая хитинг систем ))"
5828355,"Unser Aufenthalt in Ingo und Floriens Wohnung war einfach toll. Ingo hat uns freundlichst mit Prosecco und guten Restaurantempfehlungen empfangen. Die Wohnung ist spitze, es hat uns an nichts gefehlt. Wir lieben es stylisch zu wohnen. Ingos Wohnung ist stylisch! Klasse! Die Lage ist super, ein Grachtenblick der unbezahlbar ist! Danke, dass wir Eure Wohnung mieten durften. Wir kommen gerne wieder.Susanne und Andreas aus Herne in NRW."
5860796,"I had a great stay. Corina was very responsive and helpful. She met me at the BnB and gave me a great explanation of the area and suggested some activities and sights to see. The room was as described, and is in an excellent location - some great restaurants around and a pleasant walk to the main attractions. Don't hesitate to stay here!"
5903454,"We were welcomed by a friend of Merle's who lives close by and who was extremely helpful. The apartment had been completely renovated just before our arrival, so it was in fact better than the photos! The use of space was very effective, there was a comfy sofa corner as well as a window seat in the opposite corner, overlooking the outdoor balcony and back garden, which made the apartment very light and green. Fantastic to have a completely new kitchen and bathroom. To give storage space, the bed is raised off the floor. There is a small step ladder to help you climb in and out again. Just thought we'd mentione it for those who might need to get up in the middle of the night. We enjoyed the neighborhood - the street just at the corner, Jan Pieter Heije Straat, is very convenient for food shopping, cafes and inexpensive eateries. The food hall and market are also fun. It was wonderful being outside the center of the city. The museums we wanted to visit are in walking distance - but sometimes we took the tram. There is a stop just up the street - lines 7 and 17 which take you directly to the Museumplein or the city center. The apartment is on a quiet street, so no noise during the night."
5910582,"Anne-Marie was great at check-in. Gave us a good overview of the flat and the area with loads of information and brochures about the area and Amsterdam. <br/><br/>The flat itself was as per the listing and we enjoyed staying there. The bed was big and comfy and the living room / dinner had enough space to spread out and relax after a day out.<br/><br/>The area is great too! It's just over the river from Amsterdam Central Station and it was an experience to take the boat (free! Runs until midnight for the ferry closest to the flat and 24h/day for the one slightly further away - still walking distance) back and forth when we went into town. Being over the river made the area really relaxed and calm but it was cool how you could still be in the Centre of Amsterdam in about 15 mins.<br/>"
5920208,"Corinna is super nice, and the apartment is just as described. The location couldn't be better -- right in the heart of the Jordaan, and adjacent to the canals and ""nine streets."""
5921577,Karin and Vincent are gracious hosts. The location is excellent! We walked everywhere. Karin has a binder with restaurant suggestions as well. We would return to stay here without hesitation. 
5929434,"Staying at Tootsie's place was a charm. She made sure we felt confortable. Made also sure she would be there when we arrive. She even gave us a bottle of wine and some food for the morning.<br/><br/>The place is nice. Well located if you can walk a bit. Close to bike rental shops ( a  must in amsterdam).  <br/><br/>In short, only good word for the ""casa Vrolik"". Will make sure to stay there again on my next time in Amsterdam."
5929571,"A small, quiet and nice place in A'dam to stay. Only the Breakfast Club was closed on sunday.....so we have to find and pay for another......"
5956766,"Jeroen's welcoming was very nice and he supplied us with the necessary information in terms of some sites to see and good restaurants. <br/>He also rented us two bicycles at a cheap rate which enabled us to get around town very efficiently."
5979477,"Anna was a very nice and lovely host, making us feel comfortable and at home.<br/>She, and her cat, were there to welcome us in a bright and beautiful flat, very well situated in a nice neighborhood, right next to a big parc.   <br/>Anna provided us a comfortable bed in a cute bedroom, a beautiful bathroom, and we had a good time sharing with her our breakfasts in a lovely living room facing the trees.<br/>She also gave us very good advices to visit Amsterdam, and find nice places to eat or to go out to.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to come back and spend another good time with her!<br/><br/><br/>"
5984321,Top !! 
5998465,"I stayed at Matthijs and Francina's b&b during my summer trip to Amsterdam this June and they were excellent hosts! My boyfriend and I arrived late but they were still very accommodating and gave us a warm welcome! Matthijs gave lots of tips of where to eat, how to walk from place to place, lovely tips! The room is tastefully decorated and we really slept well! Amsterdam is a lovely city to visit and I'm glad that I managed to visit the Big 3 museum- Van Gogh, stedejik & Rijksmuseum. Oh, and the breakfast place that ties up with the b&b is equally lovely! You can assured to have a lovely breakfast to kick start your day! And I recommend the nice bier place at Nes street which is a stone's throw away from the b&b. I'll definitely stay here again!"
6004103,"My friend and I had such a lovely time at Joke’s Place. The house was delightful and charming and incredibly clean. Breakfast was just amazing and we have been truly spoilt :) Joke is the perfect host you could ever ask for; she is wise, genuine, engaging, thoughtful, trustworthy and above all deeply compassionate. Her hospitality was first class and she made us feel very welcome and care for. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and hope to return sometime soon to see our dear and beautiful friend, Joke. <br/><br/>* ps., Joke, words can't describe the appreciation and respect we have for you. You will be greatly missed.."
6015417,"Our family of 5 had a great time in Rogier's beautiful and stylishly decorated home.  The view from the living room of the canal is gorgeous, and we loved having coffee overlooking the canal every morning.  .<br/><br/>More than the home itself, nice as it is, Rogier is truly a host who goes above and beyond for his guests. He was always accessible. e.g. We called him with questions on navigating the home electronics setup, and even though it was past 10 pm, Rogier volunteered to come over and get it going.  Additionally, we left a few of our little one's bedtime books behind, and Rogier reached out to us, got our home address in Chicago and mailed it back, (and did not even take us up on our offer to pay!).<br/><br/>Thanks for taking such good care of us, Rogier.  We hope to be back soon!<br/><br/><br/><br/>"
6031509,"David was absolutely great!  He manages the rooms like a little boutique hotel, helping us with little things like printing tickets, changing out our towels, and generally just making us feel super welcome.  <br/><br/>The room is beautiful, and also has a little mini-fridge and hot water kettle, which were really nice to have.  <br/><br/>The building is located very close to the train station (which is very convenient).  It is also in the heart of the red light district, which has its pros and cons.  The room itself was very quiet."
6033460,"Hi Bop<br/>Fantastic studio digs, location and experience.  <br/>We really enjoyed your hospitality, the (non-standard) extras and your sense of humour.  Our boat trip on the harbour was incredibly memorable and a highlight of our trip to Amsterdam.<br/>Love to swop with you guys some day, let us know when you plan to make it back to Sydney.<br/>Cheers<br/>Jo & John"
6048894,"I stayed at Zoku for 7 days. The rooftop social area, work areas, and fine-dining were AMAZING. In fact, this was the only place I have worked that I did not leave the hotel or go outside for 3.5 days. I worked in a corner, rooftop area that overlooked the city... ate breakfast, lunch, and dinner there. Cocktails watching the sunset looking over the rooftops of Amsterdam. Staying at Zoku was almost magical. <br/><br/>*  https://goo.gl/photos/T2dHiLWjopHnEQYw6<br/>*  https://goo.gl/photos/Vh2EueSjk9geQ7L96<br/>"
6068265,"Our host Monica was a delight, she greeted us with warmth and generosity, was a wealth of knowledge of the city and made us feel very welcome to her beautiful home.  We thourghly enjoyed our visit in Amsterdam, and it was so nice to come back to her beautiful home after long days walking all over Amsterdam.<br/>Monica's home is beautifully furnished, full of light and beautiful views, and the roof deck is an additional bonus! We hope to return to Amsterdam and Monica's lovely home!  "
6077427,"We absolutely loved our stay with Mattijs and Francina. They were so welcoming and lovely, and the room was gorgeous. The location is fantastic, and the breakfast they served at a little bakery down the road was delicious. 10 out of 10 - we will 100% be staying here when we return to Amsterdam!"
6078697,Jacob was a wonderful host! He went above and beyond to make sure I felt comfortable and enjoyed my stay. The apartment was also very comfortable and an easy walk to trams or buses to get to other areas of Amsterdam. I would definitely stay here again!  Rosie and I got off to a rough start with some miscommunication but in the end I could tell she really wanted me to enjoy my stay. The room was lovely and it was a very nice neighborhood. 
6108193,Lotus made our trip to Amsterdam perfect. It was so comfortable. We felt in love with the boat and we can't wait for our next stay on board!!! There is enough space for bigger groups and you can't imagine any better atmosphere. Olaf was really nice and helpful. We recommend lotus to every group of people that wants to have an amazing time with lots of fun and maybe a few beers;-)!<br/>There is everything on board you need !  
6113161,"Fantastic Airbnb to stay in. Really helpful when we arrived, so friendly, gave us lots of ideas of things to do in the city. It's just a shame we were only there for a very short period of time! Definitely recommend staying here. Good value for money. Thanks!!"
6115101,"Maike and Caspar were extremely friendly and welcoming during our stay with them. When we were there, Amsterdam was raining almost all the time so they provided us with umbrellas and rain coats, which is really useful because we can't bring these items on board when travelling light. The breakfast they prepared was always so scrumptious and it always makes me so happy and excited to wake up to it, enjoy a nice breakfast by the sea (with a tulip on the table) before going out to explore Amsterdam for the day. Although the location seems slightly far from the city centre on the map, it is actually very nearby as there are direct bus to the central station and direct tram to the museums area,  so it was not a problem for us at all. I can totally see why they are 'Super Hosts' now. "
6128619,"Thre os us recently spent two nights in Pim's apartment. Pim was there to give us a very friendly welcome (with a beer). He explained various things including setting up internet access and even went to get eggs and bacon for our breakfast.... and there was beer and wine in the frig ! It is  where Pim normally lives himself and there were a lot of personal effects around. <br/>We did not spend much time in the apartment which is a little quirky and modest in size  but everything was there that we needed and it was adequate for our purposes. It is in a pleasant and quiet neighbourhood. There is a convenient bus to the city centre and the Central Station although we did not use it . As the weather was fine we walked everywhere - about 30 mins into the centre. "
6150222,"There is much to recommend this listing.  Rosie is a warm and delightful host.  The physical layout of the flat is functional and pleasant (lots of light).  The location is superb.  Seven minutes by train from the airport and a short walk and you are there.  Once there you are within easy access of anywhere you want to go in Amsterdam.  The neighbourhood is quiet and very pleasant-so much nicer than if one is close to the center with all its noise and bustle. Yet you can reach the center very quickly by tram if you want to.   This was our second stay with Rosie.  Two reasons.  One, the location is amazing.  Two minutes walk from a tram stop with which to easily connect to anywhere in the city or the train to Schipol.  On a quiet street yet with ready access to shops and restaurants.  And since our last stay, a new hipster coffee shop one minute walk from the front door!<br/>Two, the host is very helpful and accommodating.  Our arrival time was a bit out of the usual and Rosie was away so I dealt with three members of the family to sort this out--all extremely helpful.  Rosie is super efficient at responding to queries and requests and most accommodating.  A great place to stay."
6161913,"Our Second AB&B experience and it was truly wonderful  Margot is a lovely host with a beautiful studio on a quiet canal that is a 3 minute walk to all of the "" amsterdam action"" but its so peaceful and quiet there.  The space is fitted out with everything you could need and Margot stocked the fridge with all the fixing for breakfast for our stay,  Meats, eggs, cheeses, bread, coffee, tea, milk and even stoopwaffles.  When we come back B&B MONDRIAAN will be our stop!"
6178464,"Prachtig mooi groen plekje in Amsterdam, heerlijke overnachting gehad. Snelle reacties van Marga per sms, met de auto opgepikt en kon zo aanschuiven voor avondeten en ontbijt. Het houtkacheltje maakte het plaatje compleet. "
6210778,"This is a lovely apartment in a nice quiet part of town with good places to eat nearby.   Rose and her husband were delightful hosts, full of information and enthusiasm about the places we wanted to see and visit.   We were very unlucky with the weather as it poured hard and was quite cold for much of the weekend, which meant we didn't see Amsterdam at it's best and found huddling in restaurants and bars was more satisfying than queueing in the rain!   However, the warmth of the Gianni's welcome made up for that and we loved their enchanting apartment.   Very comfortable bed, a well appointed shower room and a splendid breakfast - all one could ask for ....and we enjoyed meeting their other guests too."
6232535,"Before I even stepped foot onto the houseboat, Juuls & his family couldn't of been more hospitable and welcoming making us feel at ease immediately. The house lives up to the photos and was such a great experience and novelty. It's one easy tram ride (5-10mins) to the city or there is bikes you can hire to ride. The house boat was fully equipped with everything you could need and if there was anything else you could possibly need, nothing was too much of an asked for Juuls. It was such a great experience and I would definately stay on the houseboat again if I ever return to Amsterdam. I definately recommend. Thanks Juuls & Family."
6234125,"Bien avant le séjour, Tatjana a pris contact avec nous pour prendre le temps d'échanger sur notre arrivée (heure prévue, les différents moyen de rejoindre son appartement depuis l'aéroport, son contact et celui de Mire, un ami du voisinage). Hôte très prévenante et accueillante, à l'écoute et à l'initiative pour améliorer notre séjour. Nous avons eu des retards de vol et elle a pu s'organiser pour que l'accueil se fasse avec quelqu'un. <br/>Pour le départ, même à une heure très matinale (5h30), Mire est venu nous dire au revoir et a même réservé un taxi pour nous.<br/>L'appartement est très clair, calme, spacieux et le quartier agréable (nombreux commerces) y compris en soirée (places, rues et restaurants).<br/>Certainement une de nos meilleures expériences."
6240734,"Robert & Anna are welcoming and their flat well located & very clean.<br/>However they asked us to check out at 11.00 am , we were quite surprised as it is not a hostel. We usually are not asked  to leave so early on Sunday.  <br/>The sofa bed was also very unconfortable, especially for people like me with painful back. So we were a bit dissapointed for the price we paid. It is over rated. <br/>"
6260432,"The place is awesome, near from the station and very confortable. Had a great time! "
6274524,"My partner and I had an excellent one-week stay.  The room was exactly as described with all the amenities that one would want.  The room is on the first floor at the rear of a canal house, so street noise was never a problem despite being located so close to the Red-Light District.  The location was perfect.  It was close to Centraal Station and we never had to walk far to find an excellent restaurant.   We didn't have much contact with David, who lives on the second floor of the canal house, but then we didn't need to contact him.  I'm certain that if we had an issue, he would have been readily available.  Also, correspondence with David prior to our arrival was easy, as David always replied with a very short delay to any query.   Finally, I should add that if we ever have another opportunity to visit Amsterdam, this room would be our first-choice for accommodation."
6296184,"Vibeke took the morning off from work to greet us when we arrived. She was warm and welcoming and even served us cookies.  She explained the tram system, gave us a list of popular tourist sites and went over a map of Amsterdam with my husband.  We had a delightful time in Amsterdam and thoroughly enjoyed Vibeke's charming home. The bed was super comfortable and the accommodations delightful. We will definitely go back!"
6321840,"Anne-Marie has been welcoming and very helpful in making our arrival easy, as well as the departure. We really wanted to be at that precise location and the flat is awesomely nice and very dutch with it's nice garden on the backside and the sun coming in in the morning. It was easy all along, we clearly felt like home and we'll definitely go straight back next time we're coming into town. Thanks again!"
6354788,"every thing went smoothly with micha.<br/>the flat is near a subway station and is quite large.<br/>micha welcomed us warmly with food, drinks and advices. he even lent us 2 bikes.<br/>very good price. if it s free, just go for it !"
6375058,"We recently spent six nights at Diewert's ""bed-no-breakfast"" ... it was a wonderful resting place between our trips around Amsterdam. We bought a four-day bus-trolley-metro pass which gave us great freedom to roam the city. Everything about the houseboat is really nice ... clean and modern ... nice bedroom, spiffy bathroom, nice garden for relaxing outside. I'm sure you will be hearing from some of our friends ... many of them envied us this houseboat adventure!"
6381737,"We had a lovely time in Amsterdam. The location is very central and there is a bicycle hiring company around the corner with good rates. There are good restaurants about 3 minutes walking from the flat. Both Matthijs and Francina were lovely hosts and have some good tips on what to do and where to eat.<br/><br/>The room is small, but very cosy. Blinds and curtains make the room extra dark especially in Summer season.<br/>The bathroom is spacious and you can get a clean towel every day.<br/><br/>All in all it was a lovely experience and we will certainly visit again!"
6393262,"Everything was done very well, from the instructions to the accommodations. I had the whole place to myself. I look forward to returning. "
6405673,"We were warmly welcomed by Wieke who waited for us despite a late flight, the apartment looks great (better than in pictures!) and everything was as expected. Location is fantastic, on a nice (and surprisingly quiet) street with bars, shops and restaurants right in the city centre. I'd deffinitely stay here again. "
6428200,"Pim's place was very nice. Clean, comfortable and extremely well located.  We had a great time staying there.  Everything worked fine and he makes you feel very welcome.  We would stay again!"
6430352,"My mum, sister and i were to be spending our first WE in Amsterdam, but as we knew we'd be walking around all day long and we'd only be sleeping at the flat, we basically were looking for beds in the center... but we got so much more with Sarah-Jane's place: we got a perfect lovely cocoon, neat and clean, that felt just like home.<br/>And although the location is fantastic (in the old center, that is the nicest neighborhood), like one/two streets away from great & lively bars/restaurants/breakfast place & supermarket/bus/tram, it is located in a very quiet street. <br/>Sarah-Jane was -unfortunately-out of town, but she answered all my many questions prior to our arrival and worked around my tricky arrival schedule to arrange with the handling of the keys, then we got extra informations with her dad (kindness runs in the family, no doubt) or with the documents she had prepared and left for us at the flat...along with drinks, coffee and breakfast ... What else?!<br/>Thanks again Sarah-Jane, i really hope to meet you soon in Luxembourg.<br/>In a few words : i can't recommend the place enough!"
6431533,"A great place to stay. Everything you'll need in a perfect location in the city. Close to everything. For the second time visiting, it was an excellent stay. Great place centrally located with great hosts. "
6434566,"Rob war ein sehr freundlicher, offener und hilfsbereiter Gastgeber. Er hat uns herzlich willkommen und in seiner sehr sauberen und hellen Wohnung haben wir uns richtig wohlgefühlt. Die Lage ist einfach perfekt, wenn man Amsterdam erkunden will.  <br/>It's easy to hire a bike and explore the Grachten belt, the Jordan and all the other sights. Everything is just around the corner. Robert is a very kind host, ready to help and give recommendations on what to see and how to get around. We enjoyed our stay very much!!"
6438614,"The apartment is really good, spacious, very well kept, clean, comfortable, and, above all, perfectly located! We did not meet Roman in person, but everything was organised very well and he was responding almost immediately, so we had no problems with checking in or out. <br/>"
6451838,Jeroen and her friend are very cute and We loved the  room. The appartement is situated  at 10 min by bus of the central station and there is night buses every hours. You çan ask information to them  and They Will be glad to answer you.
6476296,Sjoukje was a very friendly and welcoming host and we had a good time in her flat (we also appreciate her cat Naz). It was easy to communicate with Sjoukje.The location of the appartment is perfect because it is very central and also in a really calm area. The room was pretty small but the bed was very comfortable. The only negative thing was that the kitchen wasn't really clean. Otherwise she was a perfect host and I would recommend her to everybody!
6504408,"To us, being in Amsterdam felt like being in a fairytale and Jo's warmth and hospitality only added to that feeling. She was incredibly communicative and helpful in advance of our trip and flexible with our arrival, and once we arrived she could not have been more kind and helpful. She spent time showing us maps, giving us an insider's recommendations, and listening to our questions. We felt well supported by her from the start.<br/><br/>Then there's the space. Jo and her husband are architects and it shows. This space felt cozy but spacious for a couple, and it was outfitted beautifully. She had towels, tea, coffee, dish ware, etc all ready for us. And Jo's home is right next door, so it was nice to know she was close by if we had any issues (which we didn't).<br/><br/>And finally, the neighborhood. We didn't know Amsterdam at all before visiting so picking a spot was a bit of a gamble. But this quiet spot is close to so many things, including the Plantage neighborhood with lots of cafes, many canals, and bike rentals.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this place, especially to couples. Jo is the ideal host!"
6508918,"We really enjoyed our stay at Petra's. Room 1 was clean and spacious, with a well-designed attached bathroom. The bed was comfortable and the shower large. We shared a kitchen with Room 2 and while he didn't keep it as clean as we did, we were grateful for the fridge and coffee/tea facilities. There was also a stove and microwave for people who want to cook. We found the local restaurants to be great, even the cute little neighborhood place across the street. <br/>The location of the unit was perfect for us - far enough away from the city that you didn't get many tourists (we prefer living the local life) but close enough to walk to within 30-45 minutes. If walking isn't your style, there is a tram stop just down the block.<br/>While it's far away, keep in mind this is still a city and an old building, so there is some city noise. We didn't mind it much and felt that the noise was reasonable (as people who live in another major city, we are used to it). <br/>We would definitely return to stay at Petra's if/when we visit the city again!"
6520013,"I didn't have the occasion to see Nima as he were not here, but his very nice father made all things easier for us. He even brought us to the supermarket and made us discover the very green area where Nima and his father live.<br/>We also enjoyed taking the ferries every day. There are also lots of quality restaurants at the harbor.<br/>The negative point is that I find the value for money a bit high as we were sharing the bathroom and all facilities with two other guests and it was not mentioned until they arrived."
6531381,"Our stay in Amsterdam at the Boat and Bike House was superb. Cozy, great location, everything we needed! Found a fantastic Pub two doors down, with great food, staff and atmosphere."
6532964,"My boyfriend and I spent a few nights at Matthijs & Francina's place and had a great time! The place was very comfortable and couldn't have been in a more central location. <br/><br/>Matthijs provided us with all sorts of helpful information including maps upon arrival, which was much appreciated. He suggested a bike ride to Zaans Sans (open air museum - not quite sure of the spelling) and it turned out to be an adventure and one of the highlights of our 5 week trip.<br/><br/>""The Last Crumb"" where we were given breakfast had some of the most delicious baking and sandwiches I've ever had in my life. I'm home now and I'm still craving their food! <br/><br/>I would highly recommend booking with Matthijs and Francina for a very enjoyable stay in Amsterdam. "
6554985,"L'accoglienza dell'host è stata buona e l'appartamento conforme alla descrizione. L'aspetto negativo è stata la mancanza di rispetto nei nostri confronti con i bambini che correvano tutto il giorno, procurando rumore e urla continue. Quattro sere su sei hanno avuto ospiti  incrementando il disturbo già costante.  <br/>Fortemente sconsigliato a chi cerca un soggiorno tranquillo."
6567261,"Very smooth, easy process, lovely big 3 bed house with Garden, great location, accomodated 5 adults with 5 bikes. Higly recommended. Thank you for the bottles of wine Djoke, well needed after cycling from London-Amsterdam! We may be back next year."
6571471,"We have one room without heating. But the boat is very cool, thank you. Special mention for bathroom"
6571851,"Ana is a great host, very welcoming and helpful. The apartment is located in a quiet area (free parking in front of her house!) but you can reach the centre in 10 minutes by bus. Her beautiful apartment is well equipped and very clean. The bathrooms are nearly luxurious!<br/>We had a fantastic weekend and almost our 2-year-old son felt very well! We would definitely come again!<br/><br/>"
6578917,"We had an awesome stay with Hans and Wendy. Super easy guys, welcomed us very warmhearted and made us feel very comfortable. The apartment was clean, loads of towels, very cosy and they placed coffee, some fruits and chocolate in the room for us - aaand one day we even had muffins at our door :). The place is located at one of the main hot spots. When you open the door, you are right in the middle of some action, but as soon as you close the door , you are on an island - it's quiet and good to sleep, since the sleeping room faces the inner building. Wendy took time to give us some hints about the city. All in all, we would highly recommend to stay there and would love to go back at some point :). Thanx Wendy and Hans for making these few days a good birthday to remember!!!"
6586982,"Vibeke was a great host, very helpful and caring. Not only she organized our stay even though she was away at the time (that’s why we, unfortunately, didn’t meet in person), but also gave us all needed tips and provided us with all useful information. She even discounted the price of our stay due to late departure of previous guests and time needed to clean the house after our arrival. <br/>Her apartment is equipped with everything you need and is located in quiet and nice neighborhood. It is also well communicated with city center and airport. Nearby is supermarket and some cafes and restaurants. <br/>Thank you very much Vibeke!     <br/>"
6593293,"A warm welcome, a tidy room with art pieces at the wall, a comfortable bed, a clean bathroom and a friendly cat. <br/><br/>The house is central to a lot of museums, the local traffic, the innercity, the daily flower market around the corner. <br/><br/>Everything was great. Thank you for all your kindness, Edwin!"
6607720,"Wytse's place is in a perfect location in central Amsterdam. We were able to walk anywhere we wanted to go. The apartment itself was very nice. There were a few quirks related to its age - narrow stairs, no traditional overhead shower - but these were very manageable.<br/><br/>Wytse lives on the bottom floor of the house, and we had to deal with some extremely loud music coming from his unit the day we arrived. This continued for several hours, even after a polite discussion. It was definitely a negative for me.<br/><br/>We had no major issues the rest of our stay, and the location truly is excellent."
6625913,"Unfortunately for us, our taxi driver dropped us at the wrong end of Jachtshavenweg, despite me giving him a piece of paper with Harry's directions on it. Anyway after an hour of dragging suitcases along the streets and bike paths we found the Houseboat. Harry & Anna welcomed us with a cold drink and snack. The houseboat is quite spacious and was very comfortable for the three of us. We enjoyed bike riding in the Forest but preferred to use trams to get into the city. Harry was very helpful with directions for the local grocery store, Albert Heijn and where to catch public transport.<br/>We really enjoyed the novelty of staying on a houseboat.<br/>Thank you Harry & Anna."
6662045,"Debby and Raf's place was amazing! Even better than the photos and easy access to Centraal Station. You really get the Amsterdam experience when you can see a canal and a real windmill from the window. Debby was very communicative (even from out of town) and left us yummy breakfast foods including a delicious bottle of wine. The house was very clean and comfortable. Loved the tub/shower combo. Check in and out was the best I've ever had at an Air BnB. Can't recommend enough! I will be back!<br/><br/>"
6670322,"Marga is a wonderful host! She and her family made me feel very welcome in their guesthouse as well as their home. Their property is lovely - a nice secluded, quiet yard that is fully fenced in and feels very private. <br/><br/>The neighborhood is also very peaceful but not too far by bike from the city center. And they were willing to give me rides to and from the city when I had my bags. Wish I could have stayed longer. "
6670806,"Marga es una anfitriona genial y el alojamiento es muy único, acogedor y limpio! La recomendaría esta habitación, ¡Muchas gracias Marga!"
6681723,"Uros's place was excellent, a beautiful apartment with convenient location. The host was very accommodating, providing lots of directions and hints about the neighborhood and the city in general. We had a great time in this very well-designed apartment. I can't think of any drawbacks. When we visit Amsterdam again, we will certainly try to stay in this place if it's available."
6707921,"Edwin is a great host, he was very helpful and friendly in the 3 days i stayed at his guesthouse. There was a small problem with the lock of my room which was promptly fixed in a matter of hours. The guesthouse is in a wonderful position (near the famous Bloemenmarkt) very close to the centre and with lots of nice places to visit and enjoy at a walking distance.<br/>Highly recommended!"
6720561,"Toetsie was a wonderful host, she is very welcoming and thoughtful, every little detail was thought through - guide books, public transit card (she even loaded it with money), bicycles (although I did not use them as bike traffic is a bit crazy), wifi, enough ingredients for a full breakfast, a set of towels and toiletries and even a bottle of wine. The house was clean and had lots of personality, which I really liked. As I was there only for a short time, we only had a quick chat when I arrived, but she had welcomed me to drop by anytime if I had any questions. The location is very convenient, only a 20 minute tram ride to the city centre, and only 10 minutes to the train station that has trains to the airport. It did not feel far from the ""action"", yet I really liked the neighbourhood as it was quiet in the evening and I was able to get a good night's sleep. I would definitely recommend Casa Vrolik and would stay here again if I come back to Amsterdam. "
6720577,What a lovely place right in the heart of Amsterdam.  Location is prime with this room and it is perfectly set up.  The thing that got me most was there was even a bath robe with some nice slippers to keep you warm after the shower.  Mirjam was very pleasant and helped me when I arrived.  I would love to stay here again if I revisit next year.
6726902,"Most pleasant experience. Couldn't have had a better stay. Room was clean, breakfast was delicious. Had a cosy robe which always made it a treat to hang around in. Beautiful room, wonderful utilities and Petra is such a lovely woman. Couldn't recommend enough. You will love your stay! "
6749834,"Mathilda was a very friendly and great host. She was very attentive and informed us about all the things we need to know. She orderd us the parking tickets and the confide she spend to us was amazing. The flat was tidy, nice and good equipped. If we find the time we definitly will come back to her. "
6769054,"I had such a wonderful experience staying here. The location couldn't have been better for me. I walked everywhere. The studio was exactly as pictured and described. I especially liked that the door was keycode entry so no risk of fumbling for keys late at night. The only comment I would make would be to other solo female travelers- the door and window do not have blinds or curtains so it did take me a couple nights to get over the ""exposed"" feeling as the bed is in direct line of site from the window. I had absolutely no problems because of this, simply psychological as I was traveling alone. That said I wouldn't even consider staying anywhere else for my next visit! Second time I've stayed here. Perfect as always! Great location. This hotel is clean, contemporary and in a great location if museums and Vondelpark are your top priorities. We really only had one complaint, and it’s that they charge you €60 for early check in. My 66 year old father and I had a horrendous flight there and really hoped an early check in may be possible. We were excited when we found out the room was ready- but that it would cost us if we didn’t wait until 3. (We got there around 12). This feels so petty and inhospitable- not a great welcome."
6774266,Great location.  The apartment was clean and everything was in working order.  Nicolet was welcoming and accommodating. 
6776478,"Nice place ... is 1 minute from the tram stop. The apartment has 2 floors has everything you need. Throughout the apartment arranged flowers and plants that certainly gives comfort. Jordis was very helpful and answered all the questions. Upon arrival, we waited syurpris a tasty apple pie. We spent a great weekend in this tsudesnom city."
6777677,Great Host! Lovely house and perfect location! Everything is around you and easy acces to Schiphol and centre! 
6802717,"Viola and Daniel were perfect hosts, and the apartment was fantastic. The bed was really comfortable, the kitchen had everything needed, the housekeeping was spotless and it was filled with light from the many windows. The location, in a peaceful residential area with a few restaurants and cafes and on a beautiful canal, was ideal -- about 5 minutes to the best shopping street in Amsterdam (Haarlemmerdijk/Haarlemmerstraat), a couple of minutes further to beautiful Westerpark and the Jordaan, and close enough to Central Station to walk to/from. The #3 tram line stops across the street and goes down to the Museumplein (and further). I will definitely stay here if it is available for my next trip to Amsterdam and will recommend it to my friends."
6803294,"Hands down the best Airbnb experience we have ever had. Marcel's place is beautiful, very clean, and extremely well taken care of. It's like being in a 5 star hotel with the comforts of home. Everything you need is at your fingertips! It even has a lovely garden, heated floors and a bbq pit for those warm summer evenings :). The house is in a great location, close to restaurants, public transportation and beautiful parks. Marcel is the perfect host. From our initial correspondence all the way to our last day there, Marcel was warm, kind and generous. He even drove us to our new home in Amsterdam since we had too much stuff to fit in the bus. We can't recommend this place enough, especially if you have kids! "
6814805,"We had an excellent trip in Amsterdam!<br/> Stefanie and Mathias were excellent host! We had a great communication, and our arrival and check out were perfect. It's a really really nice couple!<br/>The apartment was comfortable, spacious, clear and clean  so we really felt at home there. <br/>You can do almost evrything by walk but if you want, their is a tramway station just in front of the appartment.<br/>I would definitely stay here again! <br/>Thanks for all"
6823302,"I spent 3 lovely days in Amsterdam with my girlfriend in Laura's appartment. The appartment is located in a beautiful and quiet place, downtown Amsterdam is not very far. It was a cosy flat, a great living room with à lovely bedroom, the shower is perfect.<br/>But the most impressive is the host Laura. After many trips with Airbnb I can easily say that Laura was the best host I have ever met for sure, very convenient She prepared perfectly the appartment before our arrival, every morning she brought us a very nice breakfast in a basket. And the last day she offered us flowers for Valentine's day. I could not imagine having a better experience that we had with this booking.<br/>Once again thank you Laura, thanks for all.<br/>I will advise this appartment for every persons who will go to Amsterdam <br/>Best regards from Vincent and his girlfriend who spent 3 wonderful days in Amsterdam"
6833560,"A great flat in a great location with a great canal view and a very kind and helpful host!<br/>We were 6 guys coming at the end of May for a stag party.<br/>We have been greeted by Ingo with Proseco and cookies! Nice and very welcome after our long journey to get there.<br/>Even though we were about 2 hours late (because of traffic and full parking) Ingo was very patient and friendly and came to pick us up at the most convenient tram stop.<br/>He gave us good tips about the area and was precisely on agreed time for the check out.<br/><br/>The flat is absolutely awesome. You can sometime be disappointed by the reality compared to the pictures but not this time!<br/>Not only it is very nice but it is also very convenient and well equipped (there is even a Mac book that you can use).<br/>There is only one double bed but the couch is comfy and Ingo arranged an electric self-inflating mattress and another air bed with manual pump.<br/>Even at 6 we didn't have the feeling of being packed inside.<br/><br/>The location of the flat is brilliant as at walking distance of the main places of interest.<br/>Strongly approved and recommended by us! "
6836260,"Me and my mom had a very nice stay, the boat is very cute and cosy just like in the pictures. Location is great and the host was very helpful."
6839194,"We spend three nights ag Kate's cozy room, it was clean with a good space.<br/>Location is good not among the loud gangs walkin around but still 10 mins walk to both central station or Dam sqaure.<br/>Kate was nice, and very helpful<br/>And she had playstation 2, FIFA 2002 and lots of golden age games "
6871637,"I can only praise Merin’s truly amazing apartment! First of all, it is situated in a very nice and quiet area close to the Rijpgracht, which you can even see from the apartment! The roof terrace is just lovely and pleasant greenery surrounds the house at its backside. There is also a balcony on the lower floor. Everything is beautifully furnished since Merin apparently puts a lot of effort into her picturesque apartment: At here place, you can certainly live in style! The host herself is very kind, generous and helpful: She equipped us with a map, gave as some valuable tips, she also left food and beverages en masse. You can go to the Grachtengordel quite fast by bike but everything is perfectly in range by foot as well.<br/>Again, I absolutely recommend her marvelous apartment! If you want to explore Amsterdam it’s a perfect place to start at.<br/>"
6877600,"Gaby welcomed us very friendly and showed us everything we needed to know about the apartment and the neighborhood.<br/>The apartment was as shown on the pictures, very spacious, clean and equipped with everything you need.<br/>All in all we had a great stay in this apartment.<br/>"
6891079,"My two friends and I spent four nights in Vibeke's garden room. <br/><br/>The house is well located: it is very easy to get to Dam Central and other surrounding neighbourhoods. Furthermore, the house is extremely convenient to get to and from the airport. <br/><br/>Vibeke was an excellent host that made us feel incredibly at home - her house is equipped with everything you could need and you are free to use the kitchen and living space as you like. Furthermore, Vibeke went out of her way to help us find directions - walking us to the stop we needed herself, and even printing out maps so we didn't get lost on our way. It was incredibly kind. <br/><br/>I would highly recommend staying here if you want a comfortable room and a lovely host. Thank you so much, Vibeke! "
6901164,"Awesome place in great location of Amsterdam! We had a great stay and Edwin was an awesome, accommodating host!! We arrived early and were able to check in right when we got there. The street was very fun at night!! Lots of places to have drinks and dance within 2min walk. Thanks again Edwin!!"
6933505,"Where do I begin?<br/><br/>Amazing family. Amazing people. Amazing stay. <br/><br/>I requested to book the day before arrival. They responded to my request immediately and worked with my to check in a time that was convenient for me. They helped me find my way about town and gave me great directions to find local food, markets and other activities. <br/><br/>The room was great as well! Looks exactly like the pictures. The room had everything from a desk, a tucked away mini fridge and a lovely shower. Even a dumb waiter that leads to the kitchen for easy service. <br/><br/>All in all- I will be going back to stay with these great people next time I visit the lovely city of Amsterdam! <br/><br/>Cheers!<br/><br/>"
6943385,"Wilmer was a very good host. <br/>The house was perfectly clean at our arrival and it was also cleaned during our stay. His apartment is located in a very quiet residential neighborhood not far from the city center. <br/>A perfect stay if you rent a bike.  <br/>Thanks Wilmer! "
6955348,"The apartment was ok. I must confess that I was not 100% happy with it, but it had to do only with my own expectations rather than with a problem in the apartment itself. In my previous experiences with airbnb the presence of the apartment owner  was not as evident as in here and I did not like it. However, I insist there was nothing wrong with the apartment, just with my own standards. The neighbourhood is not all that great, although it is true that there are teams which would take you to the main interest sites within 20min.  This is a great place to stay in an unbeatable location. The tram and bus stops are very close to the house, so it's easily accessible. It took me about 20 min to get there from the airport. The room is very clean, bright and spacious, with an independent entrance. Rosie was very easy to communicate with. I did not meet her, but her daughter let me in and was very helpful too. No breakfast was offered because Rosie was out of the city, but there are plenty of options on Beethovenstraat. I would totally recommend this place!"
6955427,"Me and my firends we spent last weekend in Nelleke and Viktor house and it was perfect! The pictures correspond exactly to the reality. Their appartment is very bright, spacius and clean, full of comfort (full equipped kitchen, towels, bed sheets, lovely roof terrace, balconies) and adapt both for families and couples. <br/>It's very well connected to the city centre by bus or tram and there are many shops around the corner. <br/>Nelleke and Viktor left us all the correct information for the keys and a little welcome paper with heating/tv/internet instructions and we were also in contact through whats app for anykind of communication.<br/><br/>So, I really recommend these hosts!! <br/><br/>Thanks a lot again!!! "
6958763,"I really enjoyed staying at Rosie's flat in Amsterdam and can recommend her highly as a host. Rosie was incredibly warm and accommodating from the moment I walked in to her home. She gave me many good recommendations for things to do in Amsterdam and traveling in general.<br/><br/>The room itself is very cozy and well decorated. The bed is comfortable and the window allows for a lot of natural light to shine through. The neighborhood is also safe and quiet while at the same time very centrally located. Public transport that can take you anywhere in the city is less than a block away which made it easy and convenient to get around/return home. <br/><br/>Overall I really enjoyed my stay at Rosie and her family's flat. Thanks again!"
6964712,Martine house was lovely. The pictures do not really cepture the beauty of the place. everything was perfectly clean and Martine answered all our questions fast and gently. I would definitively suggest it for a family who deserve space during a vacation. Not to mention the balcony / garden.. a pity that we were there not during the summer. Hope to be back sometime soon with sun.  
6969507,"Rosie and her husband were great hosts! The room is very comfortable, and the apartment is in a great location very close to the tram stops. Rosie made breakfast every morning, and did everything to make sure I had everything I needed. I recommend staying here, and would definitley come back! I had a great stay in Mike’s apartment! Comfortable, good location in the Pijp among great restaurants and bars, and easy check-in. I would stay here again !"
7003541,"Absolutely love flat, as described. Mijef was lovely and showed us around and made us feel very at home. It's in a beautiful and peaceful area of the city, not too far from anywhere. I would highly recommend, thank you, Mijef.<br/>"
7003807,"We had a great time at Stephanie and Sebastian's place. Sebastian met us and gave us a really detailed breakdown of the city and recommendations on food places (great pizza and apple pie!) The tram stops right outside the door (SO easy getting to and from the airport). The room is beautiful, great shower, wifi etc. Our hosts were always contactable if we had questions. Would stay again."
7012032,"Karina and Maarten both welcomed us professional and perfect! We loved and enjoyed staying there a lot.<br/><br/>Before we visit them,<br/>both of them had very quick response on any communication having that they added more information with value you would appreciate. So we could prepare accurate before the traveling. Their information saved us a lot of travel concerns.<br/><br/>The house was very clean and there are everything what we needed for a week stay. They introduced some very tasty restaurants and bars near the house and the area is excellent to eat out for night.<br/><br/>When we leave the house, Maarten kindly arranged a taxi for us that we could not say the Dutch address sound to the Tax company if we want to call them ourself. This is just an example of their kindness.<br/><br/>Thank you again Karina and Maarten for your great hospitality!<br/><br/>Best Regards,<br/>Kei<br/><br/> The most excellent! Great communication and hospitality!"
7016120,"Stehanie & Sebastian's flat is very nice and cosy. Sebastian gave us good advices about where to go, what to do and the history of Amsterdam. The flat is small but well designed and comfortable for a couple. The area is really peacefull and perfect to rest after a long day of visit.  I definitely recommend their place!"
7038919,"L'un des meilleurs AirBNB que nous ayons fait. Un endroit agréable, un très bon accueil, et une vue imprenable sur les docks. Le logement est situé proche des transports en commun, bien que nous conseillons le vélo pour se déplacer dans Amsterdam. Chambre très propre et pratique, salle de bain privative, frigo, TV... Les hôtes sont très sympathiques. Bref, une excellente expérience."
7055012,"Staying with Wendie and Hans was central to my fantastic time in Amsterdam! They were very warm, welcoming, and friendly: Wendie greeted me and took 15 minutes to sit me down with a map of the city, and told me about some of the best local spots to see, with Hans later telling me about some awesome local restaurants and events that were happening in town. Wendie was even kind enough to share with me a few fresh muffins one morning, and to tell me about a special rail discount card for a side trip that I was planning.<br/><br/>The bedroom was cozy, comfortable, and clean; and the bathroom was luxurious with a big bathtub. I particularly appreciated the treats bar, with a coffee maker, tea, and snacks - they made for the best way to start each morning. The only thing that you will have to watch for is that the main entry door needs firm force to open and close, as the humidity during my trip affected its fit.<br/><br/>The room was perfectly situated on the main shopping street of Leidsestraat, and many of the main sights of Amsterdam were within a 20 minute walking (!) distance. Better still, the necessities were all within a two block radius, including: a tram stop, the airport bus stop, fast food places, a pharmacy, and a grocery store. Not surprisingly, this is a very busy neighbourhood, and you may want to be aware of this if you are sensitive to crowds, or to street noise, as you will hear a bit of it in the room.<br/><br/>All in all, Wendie and Hans were the perfect hosts, and the room was the perfect place for me to stay during my trip - they all embodied that quintessential Dutch ""gezelligheid"" spirit, and I'm very thankful to have experienced it!"
7057152,"Very nice houseboat we stayed at. Only problem was that it was about a 30 to 40 min trip into the center of the city. Great place to stay but if you wanted to plan anything you had to allow yourself 30 to 40 mins to get anywhere as there wasn't too much as far as food or places to shop near by. Overall it was a great place to stay. It was in a nice quite neighborhood away from all the hustle and bustle. The place was extremely clean nice and modern. Very Ikea decorated. <br/><br/>The Con's - <br/>Bedroom was very tight and small not much space to move around in. The bathroom had a very very nice tub but it wasn't really usable. Seems like the tub was just for looks as the water pressure was so weak that it would take forever to fill up. And by the time it was full the water would be cold.<br/><br/>Very weak water pressure. But I think some of the down side is that it's an eco friendly house.<br/><br/>Anyway very nice place<br/><br/>The Free Wifi Speeds Were excellent best ever 50 megs down and almost 5 up.. nice<br/><br/>Now as far as price we noticed that there are a few other houseboats in the area that my have a better value but overall not to take away fro this place very nice<br/><br/>Harry was great and answered all of our questions. I would differently recommend this a a good place. The view wasn't all that we saw the side of the houseboat next to us. If the weather was good we would have gone to the rooftop deck which was really nice when we checked it out.<br/>"
7057458,"Marijke's room was very comfortable for two adults traveling with our 13-year-old daughter, and Marijke was a friendly and helpful host. She directed us to a reasonably priced and pleasant cafe (Australian!) within a block of the house where we enjoyed a couple snacks and two breakfasts. The neighborhood is a very pleasant multi-ethnic family neighborhood within easy walking distance of some tourist attractions and the train. The only imperfection in our stay was that the host and guests smoke in the house and the smell is evident in the guest room and bathroom for people who are bothered by cigarette smoke. We did not understand this before we booked, although perhaps it would have been evident with more careful reading. "
7068871,Thank you for the great stay at your wonderful houseboat
7085023,"I didn't have a chance to meet with Gina, I was met by her sister and relatives who very friendly and welcoming. <br/>The apartment in a calm region, 5 minutes away from CS by bus<br/>The room ad bathroom were clean"
7088510,"We had a great time at Betty's apartment and enjoyed exploring Amsterdam. It's a bit small, but ideal for a few days to stay. The location is very good as you can get anywhere very quick by tram. Betty is a great host and makes sure you get everything you need and made us feel at home from the very first second. Thanks for that! "
7093716,"This is the perfect Amsterdam apartment! The location is great, the apartment is very bright and very cosy - with a great view of the streets and canals. Viola and Daniel are very nice people. Thank you for a great stay!  "
7127692,Really nice apartment in a great location! Frits was a great host as well. Everything was really smooth and easy and we had a fantastic time in his apartment and in the city!
7127795,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay with Karin. She was very nice and able to give us some great recommendations of what to do and where to go. We went to several local restaurants on her list which we really enjoyed! The room was perfect for our needs. One thing that previous commenters have mentioned that we would agree with is that you definitely hear any movements / walking / cooking, etc very easily through the floor from upstairs, but neither of us are light sleepers so this was not an issue for us!! And you cannot beat the location! While there were bikes available, we ended up just walking every where! Thanks again!"
7134664,"The houseboat is really nice and the neighborhood as well. The only thing that we didnt like is that we left our luggage due to having all day before leaving (previous request from my side) and when we came there was an old woman who barely kicked us out. Leaving that behind, the place has everything needed for a good time in amsterdam.  Bikes there are priceless"
7180963,"Host wonderful! Could not be better. She was waiting for our arrival. Had some tidbits just in case we were hungry. Every night when we arrived there was a small surprise; chocolates, cookies, etc. Room and bath A 1 OK! Cleanliness perfect! Accurate description. Excellent WiFi connection. On the downside I must mention that there is a small walk, 5 to 15 minutes, depending on your speed and gait to the tram station, fruit shop, coffee house and a couple of restaurants. Once in the tram connections are fast and easy. 5 minutes to Centraal Station and maybe 20 minutes to all of Amsterdam's tourist attractions. All in all, wonderful stay!"
7196834,"I had a lovely time at Marga's cottage. Marga and her husband were very accommodating and made me feel very welcome. They were available if I had any questions but I also had privacy in the cottage. They picked me up and dropped me off at the airport for a fair and reasonable price, which was extremely helpful and appreciated. I walked to town every day (which is a lovely stroll up the Amstel River, about three miles to the town center) but they offered to rent me a bike if I chose, which could be helpful for a guest who didn't want to walk. They also had a standing offer to include me in their healthy family breakfasts or dinners if I wanted. They were both very interested in my comfort and convenience, which was very appreciated.<br/><br/>The atmosphere of the cottage and houseboat is very calm, charming, artistic. If you're looking for a wholesome, basic, interesting, creative place to stay in Amsterdam, I highly recommend Marga's cottage."
7209916,"Yahav was not there for the first two nights of our stay. He nonetheless left, in advance, clear directions as to how we should get into the apartment and use the facilities available. The title describes the accomodation well. It offered a double bed in a room that was not spacious. The use of the garden space directly from the bedroom was very welcome. Yahav and Deirdrie were friendly, informative and helpful. The area is an easy 13 tram, or 18 bus ride from Central Station. It is a busy culturally diverse area with plenty of good places to eat, shop or take a canal side stroll. The bikes were a wonderful addition. We explored all over Amsterdam and were able to be like half the population of the city, whizzing from her to there on their bikes. 'On yer bike mate', should be the strapline of Amsterdam, but in the nicest possible way. In short we had a great time made all the better for staying in the clean and cozy accomodation provided by Yahev.    "
7212232,"Good Apartment. Easy to get to the city. Some nice bars nearby too (Wild West!). Stairs not easy for old people. Nice TVs with Netflix. Bedroom not really with curtains - couples in love be aware! Everything feels a bit old and used. Nanne is a lovely host!  Nice welcome, nice apartment. It's within an old building with stairway in construction (if someone can't walk well..)<br/><br/>Neighborhood very calm, nice Italian restaurant around the corner. Walking from city easy doable.<br/><br/>Quite pricey, but that's Amsterdam. Just for this a star less, if priced reasonable it's easy 4/5.<br/><br/>Overall - cozy apartment in a nice environment!"
7228419,"We were so happy with this rental- home was in a great location, easy to find from Central Station, and so nice to drop by the house for a quick rest while exploring Amsterdam. Even though the home was right in the red light district, the room was always quiet and we felt safe. Nice black out curtains ensured we got excellent sleep! <br/>The room was spacious and clean, and we enjoyed having wine glasses and a refrigerator so we could enjoy some treats in the room after a long day of traveling. <br/>Even though we didn't see David much, he was kind and helpful. Would definitely recommend this rental!"
7242882,"What a wonderful find!  We just spent an entire week in this spacious bi-level apartment home and couldn’t have asked for more.  I’ve used Airbnb in three cities by now and this was my best experience yet.  The place is spotlessly clean, it has extremely comfortable furnishings, and it’s equipped with everything you could possibly need or want for a short or long stay.  That includes a sauna and whirlpool.  The photos are very accurate.  The neighborhood, De Pijp, has a nice personality all its own.  There is plenty to do right there day or night, including the famous street market.  But don’t make the mistake of assuming it is too far from the Canal Zone.  It is a short walk to the museum district and a very pleasant stroll to the most famous canals – and trams are close by that go to all key attractions and central station.  Perhaps best of all the hosts, Hans and Luba, really gave the personal touch of hospitality to make sure we were well oriented and had all the guidance we needed.  This one is definitely on my repeat list."
7245406,Great place to stay in a great part of Amsterdam. Olaf was a great host!
7255648,"My experience was quite good, but the flat was quite far from the center of the city so I spent a lot in the means of transport. Anyway the department was very pleasant and quiet. The flat was not very clean infact we found a used sock under the pillow. "
7265964,Freundlicher Empfang durch Marcel. Das Zimmer ist gemütlich und hat alles was man braucht. Sauber und ruhig. Ich war sehr zufrieden. Gerne wieder.
7266990,"Marga and Rico were absolutely wonderful hosts. The guesthouse was exactly as listed, cute and quaint. The location is an easy 20 minute bike ride into town. Highly recommended!"
7344704,"Nice room in a quiet neighbourhood. Relax and very friendly host. Marc made us feel at home from the very first second. Definitely recommended! We had a very nice stay with Toetsie! She is a lovely host and there was even breakfast! The neighbourhood is nice and quiet and in walking distance of the centre of Amsterdam.<br/><br/><br/><br/> We had a lovely stay with Edith and Harald with good tips for their neighbourhood! Highly recommended"
7375407,"Very warm welcome, nice apartment in a great neighborhood. I can really recommend to stay at Jan & Raul's place. "
7381440,"First of all, it is important to say that Mirjam was a very loveable and nice host. She is very considerate and we had wonderful talks with her during breakfast.<br/>Her appartement is directly located in the city centre so Amsterdam's attractions were in easy reach. Although it was in the red light district, it was very quiet and we felt always safe. The room itself was very clean and big enough for 2 people. There was even a TV and a mini fridge. We definitely recommend Mirjam's place and would like to come back again. 5 stars!!!<br/><br/>Best wishes<br/><br/>Sebastian & Michael"
7384035,"What a lovely and authentic experience! Highly recommend if you'd like to get away from the hustle and bustle of the tourist areas. Quiet, and easily accessible. Would definitely stay here again! "
7389920,"Overall a very positive experience. The description was very accurate. Edwin was very friendly and welcoming. The room was tidy and sufficiently spacious. Most importantly, the very central location (at the heart of the triangle of gallery district eg Rijksmusuem, the old town/ red light districts, and Rembrandt house/Jewish quarter) makes this the perfect place for visitors. The room was subject to street noise during the nights of weekends but I think it's a small trade off for its location. Would certainly stay at Edwin's again when I return to Amsterdam."
7404983,Notre séjour a été très agréable chez Harald & Édith. <br/>La chambre est calme et bien placé par rapport au centre d'Amsterdam et à proximité de commerces et restaurants. <br/>Nos hôtes ont étés très accueillant et pleins d'attentions.<br/>Une bonne adresse où nous essayeront de retourner en été pour profiter autrement de cette belle ville.
7417023,"I really enjoyed my stay at Hein's studio, it was cosy, warm, clean, and in a really great location! Hein was very friendly, he gave me a hand-annotated map of Amsterdam upon my arrival, which helped me find the nicest spots and avoid the most touristy stuff. I will gladly stay with him again!"
7441835,"We had a wonderful 3-day weekend at Taco's place. The warehouse is really amazing, a cool place to stay. The presentation on AirBNB is perfectly accurate, so our expectations were met perfectly. It was clean, cosy, and great fun. PERFECT stay for a group of friends that love to share a big flat together!<br/><br/>The neighborhood was great, too. relaxed and not too expensive. Supermarket, market, coffeeshop, restaurants, all quite close. best thing is: a 20 min walk to the ferry that brings you directly to Central Station (Ferry ride takes you 5 min, and there are boats crossing REALLY FREQUENTY all day and night)"
7469301,"Thanks Vibeke for this great time in Amsterdam, and for the bike ;) ! <br/>Vibeke is a great host, very comprehensive and helping to find your way in Amsterdam. I will totally recommand her as host !<br/>Vibeke, The best !"
7473368,"much smaller then it looked like, other then that coxy and good welcoming. top floor, and the stairs was too steep!"
7477814,Perfect place to stay. Absolutely like the description (if not better than the photos!). Petra has clearly gone to a lot of trouble and the room is beautifully decorated and far larger than you'd normally get in a hotel. I didn't try the breakfast (had to leave early for work each morning) but wish I had. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a 5* room in a quiet but central location. (PS the stairs are steep though like every Amsterdam house!)
7479200,Great apartment thank you for an easy stay
7484149,"Le logement a êtes très bien décrit, le logement correspond parfaitement aux photos. Andréa nous a bien accueillis et même venu nous chercher. <br/>Elle est très gentille et nous conseils très bien. <br/><br/>Un petit mot de Laeti et Marie, <br/>Merci, Joyeux Noel !! "
7499334,War nur eine Nacht bei Gabriella und John aber es war exzellent und sehr sauber. Haben mir sehr geholfen bei der Anreise sowie zahlreiche Tipps für die Stadt gegeben. Aufjedenfall empfehlenswert ! Komme wieder. 
7502966,This place is perfect for visiting Amsterdam.  David was very nice and the location could not be better.  All the major sites are within walking distance.  Would definitely recommend this location.
7514538,"Rosie was a most welcoming host!  A true delight.  Her warmth is genuine, and she was flexible with my arrival (I was coming off a fairly late flight)<br/><br/>The room is great.  Well appointed, outlets in the right place, comfy bed, nice bathroom.  I was extremely grateful to have a chance to do a load of laundry as well (a necessity at that point).  <br/><br/>Strongly recommend a stay in this great place!  Wish I had the chance to stay for breakfast and chat with Rosie and her husband longer!"
7520865,"We really enjoyed our stay in Albertines cozy apartment. We did not miss anything and felt comfortable from the first second. The apartment is very centrally located, so you can reach everything by foot. Albertine was very charming and helpful. I can definitely recommend it to everyone.<br/>Thank you :-)"
7547082,"We were a stag group of 6 that were all blown away by how comfortable and fun the warehouse apartment was. I can't imagine a more perfect place to host a group of friends. Their are amenities nearby with shops, markets, off licenses and coffee shops within a 3-5 minute walk. Buses and taxis are available for the trip to the centre of town but 3 out of the 4 journeys that we took to town we found it more enjoyable to walk 15 minutes to ferry and then the crossing generally takes 10 minutes into the central station.<br/>The beds were comfortable and there was plenty of them, the decor is unique and the the apartment contained everything you might need and somethings you might not realise you'd appreciate such as a beer tap, jigsaw puzzles and a fully functioning industrial vice : )<br/>I'm already planning another trip with another group if Taco and Tiffany would consider having us again.<br/>Friendly and considerate hosts.<br/>Thank you, Ben"
7567400,"It was one of the best apartments I've stayed in. I travel a lot & stay in lots of places. This apartment was an ace in m book. From the perfect location, to the comfy and impeccable furnishing to the perfect layout with its small garden. Very near to transportation & a mere 15 mins stroll to the center. Paul made sure that I feel welcomed and comfy. From the abundance of towels, high speed WiFi, cable TV, to the complimentary stocked fridge. I felt at home and enjoyed myself a lot. His promptness in responding to any question & the detailed info. I can go on & on as to how I enjoyed myself. A real gem. Thumbs up Paul :)"
7571047,"Anke and Robert were great hosts.  Robert was very quick to respond and went out of his way to make our stay enjoyable.  Our flight landed early in Amsterdam, and he let us leave our luggage early so we did not have to drag it around.  The apartment itself was in a great location and very clean and comfortable.  Beautiful views from the bedroom and living room. We really enjoyed our stay.  Thanks"
7575399,"We recieved a warm welcome from Matthijs, who really seems to enjoy hosting a B&B. The room was clean and looked adorable. Furthermore, the location is perfect. We liked our stay."
7580684,She was a amazing host! If I ever go back this will be the first place I go. A whole apartment to yourself. We didn't mind walking so the 25 minutes into town and back was easy. If you don't like that there is a couple trains to get you into town and back and she will help with anything you have questions with. Such a great host and house.
7606269,Viola & Daniel's apartment is a perfect base from which to explore Amsterdam. They are fantatic hosts; friendly and very helpful. We were greeted by Daniel who made us feel very welcome and showed us how everything works and gave great advice :)
7629541,"Thanks a lot to Mijef and Henk. <br/><br/>They were very welcoming and the room was lovely, comfortable and quite big. The place was quiet enough, easy to find and well placed to visit Amsterdam. <br/><br/>"
7643595,"Séjour à Amsterdam très agréable !<br/>Le charme du Houseboat (très bien situé qui plus est) et notre hôte y étant pour beaucoup ! <br/>Tout ce qui était annoncée était au rendez-vous et même plus: petits déjeuners copieux et délicieux, ainsi que de bons conseils et la découverte de la vraie vie à Amsterdam. <br/>Je recommande vivement pour les gens qui veulent vivre une belle rencontre humaine en plus de visiter cette très belle ville !"
7651195,"We were very happy with our choice to book this particular boat - a great location (walking distance from the centre), very kind hosts. Also the boat itself was nice inside, with comfortable bed (I am not a person who can sleep any unknown place) but this was surprisingly nice for me! May be it is not suitable for very tall people, but my boyfriend is 1,85 m tall and it was okey for him. We had good time and listed Amsterdam as a place we would definetely come back! Thank you , Jake & Ayla for being part of our unforgettable holidays! Janis & Elina"
7667602,Accueil charmant d'Anne-Marie. Un très beau week-end end.
7668986,"I always check reviews prior to staying in an airbnb - and all the positive reviews are correct.<br/><br/>Petra's place is very charming, spacious and clean. It's conveniently located to get to from many tourist attractions.<br/><br/>I would definitely stay here again in the future.<br/><br/>Thanks for a great stay :)"
7678950,"Ester was incredibly sweet and thoughtful. She made us feel right at home.<br/>The home is beautiful, and the location can't be beat! You have everything at your doorstep and then some. Loved the private patio. <br/>Ester, thank you! You helped make our trip even more special. ❤️ Mijef and Henk were outstanding hosts and their apartment was roomy, charming and clean.  Great location with tons of restaurants and close to trams and buses.  Highly recommend their abb"
7681013,"Jan Willem's flat in Amsterdam is FANTASTIC! First, he is extremely organized so you will get excellent instructions on arriving at the flat, restaurants, and any other tips you require. This was my first Air BnB experience and I am so grateful it went well. Don't worry about a thing because if you plan something with Jan Willem, it is a done deal. Very easy to communicate with and truly wonderful host. I can't say enough about this flat and the city of Amsterdam. First visit there and it was great, everyone speaks English and are very polite and driven society. Hoping you have as good a time as we did. Cheers!"
7704608,"I had the privilege to stay at casa de vrolik for about 3weeks,<br/>that was one of the best time in my life and I felt completely comfortable when i was at toetsies house, she was always friendly and the best host you can ever have, although no smoking in the house, Toetsie has some surprise location for the smokers ;D<br/><br/>all in all I had a extremely well experience and definitly will be back at casa de vrolik<br/><br/>thanks for everything toetsie!"
7705238,"Cornelie was very nice. <br/>Her home was great. It was centrally located.  Beautiful place. Canal view is breathtaking. Location was excellent."
7708633,"Corina's room is in a fantastic location in the Jordaan district of Amsterdam. It's just outside the madness of the touristy center, but an easy 10-20 minute walk to most major sights. The Jordaan neighborhood has a lot of locally owned businesses like coffee shops, restaurants, shops, bakeries, so you won't be inundated with Starbucks and McDonald's like in the city center. There is also an Albert Heijn grocery store a few doors down so you can pick up any essentials or snacks.<br/><br/>The room itself was large and comfortable. The bed was comfy and the bathroom looked shiny new and had a great shower. It was too cold in December to use the back garden, but it looked like it would be a nice place to have coffee in the summer."
7710281,"Erg volledig, comfortabel & modern uitgeruste boot met een zeer vriendelijke & behulpzame eigenaar! Afstand tot Amsterdam centrum valt goed mee per fiets (ong. 10 min). In tegenstelling tot wat de foto doet vermoeden, bevindt het terras voor het verhuurde deel van de boot zich wel op het dak van de boot en niet op het niveau van de woonruimte (vermoedelijk het terras van de eigenaar). Alleszins zeer aanbevelenswaardig en voor ons zeker voor herhaling vatbaar!"
7716512,"I had a really positive stay at Rosie's. She is very organised, reliable, friendly and helpful. Amongst others, I am really grateful she advised me to check out the food festival near Westerpark - I had a brilliant time there! Would definitely stay at Rosie's again, if I were to revisit Amsterdam :)"
7718700,"Thijs was incredibly helpful from the moment I booked through to the end of my stay. The flat is big, clean and spacious and the perfect place to stay sk long as you don't mind a short walk into central. I don't so it worked very well for me! There was no issues even when I arrived much later than expected - in fact there were even some beers waiting for me!<br/><br/>Highly recommended."
7726161,"really nice room, close to the bus stop and in a nice neighbourhood. Jeroen was very helpful in giving local tips and making sure we were comfortable."
7730965,"Fenno was a great host and we loved our time at his apartment. The location is fabulous, a short and nice walk to Westerpark which is a very well designed park with restaurants, cafes and bars as well as kids play areas and a nice running route. "
7739099,"We had a great time in Amsterdam and this was partly due to Carolien's apartment. While we did not meet Carolien, her friend Patrick welcomed us.<br/>Pros:<br/>-The apartment is very well located. 5 min walk to the metro station that will take you to Central Station in just a couple of minutes. Also, you are very close to a big grocery. Only a 5 min walking distance. <br/>-Beautiful view on the Amstel river.<br/>-Calm neighbourhood.<br/>-Very clean apartment and really comfortable.<br/>-Well equipped for cooking.<br/>-Wifi works like a charm.<br/>-Very spacious for 2-3 people.<br/>Cons:<br/>We spent 7 nights at Carolien's apartment (located on the 2nd floor) and the partying that was going on, on the 3rd floor was really annoying. It only happened on Friday and Saturday though, so the rest of the week was quiet.<br/>Overall, great communications (via e-mails and the AirBnB app) with Carolien, nice and very well located apartment. I would go back, but not on a Friday or Saturday night :)"
7758041,"Floris was a great host during our trip to Amsterdam. His apartment is great! Well-located, quiet and spacious. I would recommend him wihout any doubts!"
7768033,"Really good stay ... Froukje was a great host ... There if needed, otherwise not intrusive ... Would definitely visit again ... Perfect spot for RAI, just across the street <br/>"
7775018,Marga en Rico zijn erg open en vriendelijk. Het was warm toen ik bij hen te gast was. Marga zorgde ervoor dat ik vanuit de woonboot een sprong in de Amstel kon wagen. Heerlijke ervaring!
7789103,"Corina was such a friendly and gracious host! She really cares and wants you to have a great time in Amsterdam. The location of the suite can't be beat.  We loved walking around the neighbourhood. Walking distance to the 9 shopping streets and Anne Frank's house. Thai place next door - Rakang - was delicious! Thank you Corina, hope to see you again soon!"
7795922,Very nice place with great location.
7818824,"Really nice house in a relaxed area sorrounded by water and fresh air, but with all the services necesary, bars, supermarket, etc. You can also take the tram and arrive to central station in 10-15 minutes. Diederick was really kind with us, and he helped a lot with some van rental and other details we needed, great guy definitely. The house is really big and beautiful, bathrooms and kitchen are very well equipped and is one of the best designs/architecture we have ever seen. We will repeat with him if we stay again in Amsterdam for sure. We had an amazing week in Amsterdam! The house was absolutely perfect for our stay. Huge spaces and super clean. Everything was just as described and even better. The location was really quiet, the amenities were great, and the host was very helpful for everything. We couldn't have asked for a better experience. Highly recommended!"
7820767,"I've stayed with Rosie and Matt 9 months ago, and I came back to stay with them as I had such a wonderful experience last time. Their hospitality really makes you feel at home while being away from home. I particularly enjoyed the chats on the breakfast table, could hardly tear myself away cos we were all enjoying the conversations so much. Its a great time to find out more about how families live in Amsterdam, and just making connection, also its great to share stories and experience with the different travellers who also stayed with Rosie. Matt was very helpful with giving me tips and looking up for me the timetable, on how to travel outside of Amsterdam to The Hague to visit the newly reopened Mauritsuis Museum. The place is very homely and cosy, exactly the atmosphere I was looking for. Definitely recommend the Dutch Pancakes, I have second helpings every time they are irresistible! Staying with Rose was like a home away from home. She was absolutely lovely, motherly and homely. I particularly enjoyed the chance of chatting over breakfast finding out more about the life in Amsterdam. I think that is one of the gems of Rose's place to be able to start the day off with coffee or tea and some Dutch pancakes! The weather was great while I stayed there for a week, it's a really lovely place, close to the RAI conference centre, had a lovely walk by one of the canals every morning. Rose's place is clean and tidy."
7857281,"marga & rico are very hospitable, helpful, and kind. their place was exactly as described - clean, private, fairly convenient. i would not only recommend this place but i would stay again in the future. cheers! "
7891173,"Nous avons séjourné avec une amie, chez Jerry durant une semaine. Son appartement est très bien situé, proche des commerces, des transports (bus, tram) et à 30mn à pied du centre ville d'Amsterdam donc très pratique :) <br/>Les photos de l'appartement sont fidèles à la réalité, tout était très propre quand on est arrivé et la terrasse est juste superbe pour profiter du soleil (et des visites du gentil chat du voisin). <br/>Jerry n'était pas présent pour nous accueillir car en voyage mais il s'est toujours rendu très disponible et réactif par messages. Bref je recommande vivement son appartement ;-)"
7894071,"Mirjam es muy amable y te ayuda en todo<br/>Lo que le preguntes <br/>La casa está cerca de la estación central, en pleno barrio rojo.<br/>La zona es muy tranquila y nada peligrosa. <br/>Con escaleras empinadas (típicas de Ámsterdam) pero la habitación muy limpia y cama cómoda. El baño con todos sus productos (sin secador). Sin duda volvería a alojarme en esta casa. <br/>"
7898237,"Great experience and great host. <br/><br/>We had everything we needed including an offer of breakfast. The room was comfortable and the shower clean. Towels were folded and ready on the bed.<br/>Also, the host herself is very kind and helpful. She helped us with lost baggage and even called a taxi in advance for us in the early morning. <br/>We strongly recommend Rosie for travellers wanting very reliable accommodation at an inexpensive rate in a reasonably central location (15 mins by tram to Amsterdam Central).<br/>Enjoy!!"
7912045,"It was great experience. Few days in this appartment and you will feel like at home. To wake up and see through windows in living room the canal with many ducks, rare heron and boats. You can even walk to city centre from your appartment, great for fit people, like us. It is not far away. That was awesome."
7962590,"Staying at Marieke's studio was a great experience for our first time in Amsterdam.<br/>The place is tastefully furnished and super clean.<br/>Marieke made us a warm welcome and she was super reactive since the booking, and she did provide great informations about the city and the neighborhood.<br/>We had such a great time around the studio, a lot of cafés and restaurants. We walked a lot because we like it but there are trams and metro close by Weather was perfect, we could dip ours legs in the river and rest on the grass just along the Amstel river around the corner! (people do swim during weekends) <br/>We were very impressed by the P+R parking for Amsterdam for 3 days we payed 3 euros for the car and 5 euros both of us to get to the center and back ! Other european cities should do the same ! We definitely recommend Marieke's place, and we loved Amsterdam !<br/>"
7966605,"We had a wonderful time staying at Anke and Robert's apartment!  Anke was very welcoming, and the apartment was gorgeous.  We really enjoyed the beautiful views from both sides, and the very convenient location, with easy access to many bus and tram lines, as well as being within walking distance of many places as well.  The apartment was incredibly clean, and a wonderful place to come home to in Amsterdam :)     "
7977435,It´s a every nice house with a realy nice flat were you have a adorable canal view! It´s perfect for a Amsterdam trip. Perfect Wifi and enough space for a couple. I hope we can arrange a booking for the next year again. 
7990587,"ENG the location is really good (near...everything) and mirjam is very nice. You will have all the privacy you want and the room is very very nice. The toilet is curious (little small) but in another room you have the bathroom (with shower) larger and comfortable.<br/>NOTICE: everything was well clean (we care about this)<br/><br/>ITA la posizione è davvero buona (vicino a... praticamente tutto) e mirjam è molto gentile. Avrete tutta la privacy che vorrete e la stanza è molto, molto carina. La toilette è curiosamente piccola (un piccolo loculo), ma in un'altra stanza c'è il bagno (con la doccia) più grande e confortevole.<br/>NOTA BENE: tutto è ben pulito (per noi è importante)"
8001869,"The pros: Rosie is the perfect friendly and welcoming host to welcome you into a new and unfamiliar city. I was visiting her on a recommendation from a friend. The communication from her was excellent, and she even checked me into my room early. The room itself is lovely, with French doors opening up to the beautiful, residential neighborhood. The location was perfect-- quiet and residential and ALSO within the perfect walk or short tram ride to downtown. Rosie gave me a recommendation for lunch at Bazar, which was one of the most memorable meals of my trip.<br/>The cons:  Although the listing said laundry available, Rosie said it was not available because she and her family were traveling and using it. This was a disappointment since I was traveling through multiple countries and had relied on having that. The bathroom is shared and un-glamorous. <br/>Overall recommendation: Surprises happen when traveling, especially into other people's homes with Airbnb. In my case, the pros outweighed the cons and Rosie's stay was just what I needed for my 2 nights in Amsterdam. "
8031619,"Thanks for Rob and Fang wamest hospitality!<br/><br/>With they useful tips, we visit Amsterdam and travel nearby cities with zero difficulty.<br/>Furthermore, the restaurants and cafe suggested are comfort and tasty. <br/><br/>We missed the funny chit chat wtih your family and we'll definitely visit again when we back to the Netherland."
8039001,"I had a great time at B&B Vondelpark. Everything went smoothly.<br/><br/>Coming from the airport, the house is easy to get to on public transportation. It is also well-connected to the rest of the city. It is on a quiet street. I'd recommend staying here over staying anywhere remotely near Central Station."
8041113,"Great location and a great host. Ingo always responded quickly and was very kind on arrival, he even provided all information needed for a great time time in Amsterdam and let us check in as early as possible and check out as late as possible. Apartment was very modern and spacious and will probably be staying at the same place when I return next as it over exceeded my expectations. The location was pretty much in the middle of all the top spots in central Amsterdam. If your looking for a top quality apartment with a top quality host then Ingo is your man!!"
8048779,"Nous avons été très bien accueilli par Maikke , elle nous a fait visité la chambre et nous a conseillé sur ce que nous pouvions faire à Amsterdam . Nous avons laissé la moto dans le garage et nous sommes parti en bus qui est à 2 minutes à pied de chez Maikke . La chambre est parfaite avec petit frigo , micro ondes , machine à café... Et la vue est magnifique ! Bref nous retournerons chez Maikke est Caspar c'est sur ! "
8062757,"Matthijs & Francina Korenberg treat us kindly and patiently, concern about our trip, introduce delicious restaurant. There also have tiny but clean, comfortable room and  lavatory, we feel like at home and had a great night:) They already prepare everything you can think!<br/>Here will be my only choice for next time visit Amsterdam."
8067344,"This place is great. The pictures do some justice but the place is done right with a nice decor. Located in nice neighborhood close to all main attractions and tram/bus stations. I was very happy with my accommodations here and would love to stay again sometime. As for Fenno, he was very pleasant and helpful. Can't ask for much more. Thanks again!"
8068508,"Nice and clean apartment close to the tram (number 2 or 16 - 40 min)to downtown and 40 min with Bus from Airport (easy to go), great ""Deen"" Supermarket close and different nice ethnic Restaurant around.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"
8087090,"We stayed at Mirjam's for 5 nights in September and it was wonderful. She greeted us when we arrived and explained how everything worked. She was a lovely, lovely host. Each morning during breakfast ( which was very, very good) she would sit and talk to us about all sorts of things. One afternoon she invited us to go on a boat trip with her and her neighbours ( lovely people) and we had the best time. The room was clean and tidy, we had everything we needed( towels, coffee/tea, bath robes, slippers, TV). We highly recommend staying at Mirjam's as she is an excellent host. <br/>Her hospitality, authenticity and friendly personality makes it even harder to resist not to think about coming back soon.<br/>Thaaaaank you Mirjam for everything you've shared with us. It was amazing!"
8107868,Amazing place and location!
8113869,"Great location, nearby a tram station, nice view on a canal. The appartment was clean and nice.<br/>The only thing was the bad sound insulation, so we were waken up on the mornings by Wilma's son. So if you plan to sleep late, it would not be the best place."
8114028,"We had a great stay at Mike's place! The apartment is bright and clean and we loved the decor. We fell in love with the neighborhood as well, we had everything we could ask for in walking distance (bars, restaurants,park, grocery stores, shops, coffee shops...)."
8124009,"Laura and Arjan are the most wonderful hosts we are have ever had! The apartment was perfect, the location was ideal and we had a fantastic weekend away together. They collected us from the airport and dropped us back again, brought down an amazing hamper of breakfast goodies each day and went above and beyond to do everything they could to ensure that our time in Amsterdam was the best it could possibly be. We will be back for sure! This has to be the best place to stay in Amsterdam, hands down."
8151732,Toetsi verwelkomde ons zelf en dat was gelijk goed. We bleken ook dezelfde mensen te kennen dus dat is altijd mooi!
8156415,"Simon was an incredible host. He wanted to make sure I had all my accommodations and even made sure I had his number in case I had any issues.<br/><br/>The place: This is THE way to experience Amsterdam! You feel like a local going to sleep and waking up right next to the water. It's so nice to lift the blinds and see wildlife and even tours go by. But the place offers a lot of privacy too.<br/><br/>My favorite had to have been the bed - it's so comfy and has this cool collapsible stairwell that you can keep open or close to your liking. The place also offered VERY good lighting. <br/><br/>Location is great too - you're right in the middle of everything with great bars and cafes closeby, and there's so much history on these streets.<br/><br/>You will have a great stay here :) Ray's boat is a world away from my normal house! Everything was so nicely organized and really loved the Qooker faucet! 10/10 :)"
8168933,"Our stay at Mike's Saphatipark apartment couldn't have been better. The apartment is gorgeous and so comfortable! It had everything we needed to make our stay enjoyable -- a great kitchen, comfy bed, and even a washing machine. Mike was a great host, very communicative, and even helped us out when we had trouble figuring out the washer. <br/><br/>The apartment is located right on the corner of a beautiful park just south of the city centre. It was easy to get to from the airport (and central station), and the location made sight seeing a breeze. <br/><br/>The neighborhood itself is very peaceful (more residential than the city centre), and it was nice to escape the bustle of the centre at the end of a long day. <br/><br/>Amsterdam is a beautiful city, and we can't wait to visit again soon. We will definitely try to stay in Mike apartment again!"
8177654,"The place was in a very nice area is Amsterdam. We found nice local restaurants and bars. The flat was very much like a hotel--it had everything you need. However, there is not a full kitchen and the place is operated by a company called Iambnb (not one family). We dealt with more than one person, but the contact was easy. "
8181819,"A very Nice place, near the city center. <br/>Quiet and clean, I will come back for sure.<br/>And Bronte is very helpful with her guests <br/>"
8207031,"The room is spacious and clean, the beds are very comfortable, and Joke was an excelent hostess: nice, talkative, careful, and organized.<br/>The breakfast was delicious with several items. The WiFi connection was fast and stable.<br/>The apartment is well located in front of Mercatorplein square, where there is a supermarket, simple restaurants, and grocery stores. It took us 30 minutes walking to reach downtown, or ~7min by Tram.<br/>Surely would recommend for any friend or family member."
8222519,"I really enjoyed my stay with Wilma and family. The room was beautiful—Wilma clearly has a great design sense—and so comfortable that it was tempting to stay and drink coffee longer than I should have each morning. Having coffee and a kettle provided in the room was very welcome each morning. The big windows provided lots of light when you wanted it, and the drapes kept it dark if you wanted to sleep past sunrise.<br/><br/>Wilma was cheerfully helpful in providing me with directions and transport suggestions (embrace the tram!) and made me feel like I could ask her for more information any time. I enjoyed her son giving me ""the orientation speech"" about the brief rules of the house and need-to-know info. I think he enjoyed it, too. I purposefully left my door open a little so friendly little Bonnie the cat could drop by for a couple good ear-scratching sessions.<br/><br/>As listed, the location is close enough to all the major attractions via short walk+tram trips. There were loads of helpful maps, brochures and guides provided by Wilma or left by previous visitors. The private bathroom and having my own key to come and go as I wished ideally fit my personal travel style. And the apartment is in a quiet area, so there was no noise to keep you awake in the evenings. All in all, I had a great stay with Wilma and would certainly return AND recommend her accommodation. A wonderful example of what makes airbnb so great!"
8236358,"Klaas made us feel very welcomed and the check in - check out were very flexible which was a big plus for us.  <br/><br/>Everything was very clean and spacious.  Having a balcony was a nice addition!<br/><br/>Although the house might seem far from the center (30min), it is a direct tram so it makes it much easier.  Definitely recommend!"
8239557,"Perfect apartment in a great location. Really easy to get to and the host was really helpful. They do have cats, one of which is very, very friendly. So as long as you like cats then this is the perfect place for your visit to Amsterdam. "
8253910,The home is okay.  It was kind of dirty (especially the bed sheets).  The wi-fi stopped working on our third day and the host was unable to resolve the issue.  Being stuck in a foreign country without access to wi-fi was not a pleasant experience.
8276683,"This is the sweetest deal you could get in Amsterdam, and I say that after visiting this town for the 40th time in 20 years.<br/>first off, the apartment it self is perfect, cozy, quiet, clean and very well facilitated!<br/>the location is simply perfect as well,<br/>you could literaly never leave the street it's on.<br/>it has a super market, laundry, a great bar,  a great cafe, two of amsterdams leading tattoo parlours, amazing Thai,Lebanese and so Many more restaurants, shops and I'm literally talking about the actual street.<br/>if you just walk anywhere in a 20 min radius, you can pretty much cover it all!<br/>even my favourite coffeshop in the whole town is a 3 min walk!<br/>and on top of all that goodness,<br/>Corina is the nicest, sweetest, most helpful host you can possibly imagine.<br/>in the middle of this shadey sinful city, Corina and her son provide a haven to retreat to.<br/>I almost thought of not sharing so much, just so that it remains less known and other people don't squat my new found Amsterdam haven! <br/>highly highly highly recommended!<br/>thank you Corina, see you soon I hope!"
8286205,"We were warmly welcomed by David and he made it clear to just contact him if we needed anything.  The accommodations were as described and very comfortable.  A lot of really classy touches.  The location is in the heart of the city, near the red light district, but we felt completely safe.  It is also very close to rail and other public transportation.  We definitely recommend this place.  A word for elderly and physically challenged though.  There is a long narrow steep flight of stairs to negotiate in and out.  "
8313233,"We really enjoyed our stay with Mirjam! The room was comfortable, the bathroom is shared, and the apartment is walking distance to everything. She provided us with a WONDERFUL breakfast each morning and was lovely to chat with. We were sad we didn't have a few more days in this beautiful city. Next time we are in Amsterdam, we will DEFINITELY be booking our stay with Mirjam. "
8317125,"Mark was very kind and gave us all information needed for our trip. Loft is exactly as shown on pictures, really cool and modern. Location is superb to visit amsterdam. "
8320015,I had a pleasent stay at jeroens place during my four day trip to Amsterdam. Specialy the bed was very confortable and jeroen is a very sympatic and uncomplicated person.
8343180,"A welcoming atmosphere at Indian Boort quartier in Amsterdam at the quietest street you will ever find.<br/>Not TV helped me go out often, mingling with the crowd.<br/>Great train -Sprinter- connection 1 stop from.Centraal station.<br/>Coffee and tea always available.  and clean place."
8351130,"Het was geweldig bij Maike. Er stonden verse bloemen in de kamer en een bakje met paaseitjes. Erg leuk! We voelden ons zeer welkom. Wat ook erg prettig was, was de communicatie vooraf. Maike reageerde meteen. Erg attent! Deze locatie is zeker een aanrader. Rustig gelegen, maar makkelijk bereikbaar vanuit het centrum. En een heerlijk ontbijt niet te vergeten :-)!"
8368965,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Simone's apartment. Simone left a lovely bottle of champagne for my new husband and I to enjoy on our honeymoon. Starting with the location, the Jordaan was the best possible neighborhood for us to stay in Amsterdam. It was quiet and homey, yet had so many great restaurants, cafes, and shops. On to the apartment, it was very bright and airy and I loved the quirky and artistic decor in the living room. The kitchen was great to cook breakfast every morning. We loved going up on the rooftop and enjoying the panoramic view of the city. Simone was in contact with us throughout our visit and was quick to respond when we had any issue or question with the apartment or getting around the city. Overall, we felt right at home in the apartment and I would recommend it."
8380476,"Apartament wygodny, bardzo czysty i cichy. Fantastyczna lokalizacja. David był bardzo miły i pomocny."
8403883,"Nous avons loué l'appartement de Jordis, le 10 août 2015. Il faut savoir que Jordis habite dans l'appartement, ce n'est pas une résidence secondaire. Certes situé dans un quartier calme, à 10 minutes de la Place Dam en tram, nous avons été déçus : la propreté n'est pas suffisante, l'équipement proposé est vétuste, bricolage plus qu'autre chose....nous avons laissé un mot, expliquant notre surprise, resté sans réponse à ce jour...dommage!!!"
8407277,"We had a great stay in Joris house. It is really very nice and comfortable, and very well located to enjoy the city.<br/>"
8444542,"Mr. Ingo is a wonderful host, so professional and very helping. Plus the apartment is amazing in every aspect! we would definitely rent it again. Thank you very much for everything, we had a great time at your beautiful place :)  "
8511329,"Edith was incredibly welcoming and gave Us a cup of tea and a slice of apple cake on arrival! She also took us out in her car to show us where to park, eat and the way to the university. It is a very nice neighbourhood and there are three great resteraunts within very close walking distance. You can park on the stree outside the flat for 18 euros for 24 hours."
8523355,Loved this space! This was by far our favorite airbnb space on our European adventure. The view of the canals from the space was nice to wake up to and the walk to town was down one of my favorite streets in all of Amsterdam. The cafe down stairs was open late and very convenient for a morning coffee. The many windows in the apartment gave us great light and also great ventilation during a rare heat wave during our stay. Marleen left a bottle of wine which was much appreciated after a long drive. We will be back to Amsterdam and would absolutely recommend staying here!
8582260,A quiet sanctuary in the middle of the crazy party that is central Amsterdam. Every detail is perfect in this spacious room with a nice private bath. 
8589026,"Our hosts were very accommodating and we enjoyed the unexpected breakfasts. The flat was perfect for my boyfriend and I, with everything close at hand, particularly as we rented bikes (best way to get around in Amsterdam). Would rent again."
8598803,"Ian and I just loved our stay in this bright apartment.  It was so convenient to get the tram right into the centre, and we also love the fact it was on the ground floor and had no stairs to climb with heavy cases etc.  Mirjam and Didi were delightful, so helpful and the perfect hosts, making sure that everything was OK for us, giving us lots of useful information on places to eat.  Thank You!!  Lorna"
8602627,Quiet 
8624487,Host was precise and helpful. Place was lovely. Location was great with the 24 hour ferry across the river to the centre a mere 10 minute walk away. Parking is kind of free with the car sign needing adjustment every 5 hours. Only negative was no silverware. But I found a stash of plastic forks so that worked! Luckily was not cooking so that was ample for takeaway food. 
8655689,"We had a fantastic time staying at Anke and Robert's apartment in Amsterdam.  The apartment is located in a great spot in the Jordaan neighborhood, with extremely easy access to everything (museums, restaurants, bars, etc.), yet is still in a quiet location with a great view overlooking one of the canals.  Robert was extremely helpful and kept sending us great tips on places to check out.  When we arrived, Robert and Anke supplied us with guidebooks and maps so that we could get situated very quickly.  Checking out was also very easy, and there is an express bus to the airport just a block away.  Definitely recommended, absolutely would stay again."
8658314,Reinout is an awesome host that goes all out to make sure you have a good experience. The location was amazing and the room was exactly as described. I'd definitely come back - thanks Reinout!
8659170,"Our stay at Hanneke's houseboat was great, everything was clean, organized and it had everything that we needed to stay comfortably during our vacation. Another great point to mention is that the mattress was very soft and comfortable. <br/>I'm also very grateful to Hanneke and her husband for helping me resolve a personal issue. I lost my cellphone in the city and somebody found it. This person got in touch with Hanneke through Airbnb message (thanks airbnb!) and Hanneke managed to get it back. <br/>I was so f*#*% happy when I had it back... I wasn't expecting it! Great houseboat, great place and great people...  I S2 Amsterdam!!!<br/>Thank you, Hanneke and Gerald!  "
8661628,"Joke is wonderful, so kind, helpful and when you enter to her place you will find her as kind as your mother. We had wonderful stay in Amsterdam and her place and for sure we will recommend her to everyone. If one day we back to Amsterdam we will return to Joke again. The room was so clean, and friendly environment also close to public transport (15 minutes away from centre)."
8665176,"Seriously WOW!!! Cornelie was such a gracious hostess, waiting to greet us rather late in the day. This lovely apartment is perfectly located with a view of the Royal Palace just down the street. Right on a canal, the view was amazing, and the fantastic energy of city life in Amsterdam was so much fun to watch out the huge windows. <br/>What a charming and wonderfully romantic apartment! The hand painted ceiling was fabulous, the location couldn't be beat, and right down stairs is a great place to get a massage. Cornelei was so patient in answering all of our questions, which was so helpful in making our stay in Amsterdam fantastic. And Cornelie showed us how to make the perfect cup of coffee! Truly a remarkable place to stay with a charming and delightful hostess! "
8666360,"The perfect holiday! The apartment is great as the light comes in from the big window of the living room, everything is clean, the bathroom is big and comfortable. She's super kind, almost like a second mum!<br/>Everything was perfect. I'm sure you'll enjoy your stay!"
8685312,"Le logement correspond parfaitement aux photos , l ensemble est très raffiné , propre et calme . L emplacement est très agréable , en 20 m en tram vous êtes dans le centre  et il est agréable de se reposer dans le parc juste à côté . Il y a un magasin d alimentation tout prêt , ce qui est pratique . L accueil est très chaleureux  et la communication très facile . Petra est très réactive et répond très rapidement  aux questions  Je recommande vivement , c est une très belle adresse !"
8705694,"Great location in the heart of the Jordaan - the funkiest part of Amsterdam. Apartment had everything I needed and Sarah-Jane and her father were reliable and friendly, even leaving snacks and breakfast food (much appreciated!). Apartment is as pictured, well equipped and perfect for 1-2 people. Very comfortable bed! Very quiet street, but minutes from all the fun. A great choice!"
8705886,"Great place in the perfect neighborhood.  Little shops and restaurants just steps away.  Close enough to the major sights, but tucked away from the tourist traffic.<br/><br/>Frits was a great host.  Would recommend his place to anyone visiting Amsterdam.  "
8710183,"2 girls, 1 weekend in Amsterdam. Because we had no experiences with airbnb, we also had no expectations. But Joke has laid the measuring pole really high. She had good tips for restaurants and places of interest. With her friendliness she has taken up us not only warmly, but also has prepared a tasty breakfast. We had a lot of fun. And no joke, we also asked Joke how to pronouce her first name properly. ;-) We can only recommend you Jokes nice, big and clean flat!"
8717479,"Marcel's  apartment is modern, clean and filled with sunlight and art. He was a gracious and informative host and I very much enjoyed his breakfast every morning and our conversations. "
8724951,"The stay at Marga's guest house was perfect. Lovely space and super sweet family. I enjoyed the garden and the solitude of the guest house. Marga offers breakfast to her guests which was also lovely. Highly recommend to others, I hope to be able to come again and stay longer next time."
8728189,"Joke hat uns von Anfang an das Gefühl gegeben, dass wir herzlich willkommen sind. Wir erhielten eine sehr gute Wegbeschreibung und zum Zeitpunkt der vereinbarten Ankunft hat sie uns herzlich an der Tür empfangen. Sie gab uns gute Tipps für Amsterdam und hat uns mit einem super leckerem und gesunden Frühstück verwöhnt.<br/>Alles war wie beschrieben und sehr sauber.<br/>Auch die Lage der Wohnung ist gut: mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln gut erreichbar (sowohl vom Zentrum als auch vom Flughafen), Einkaufs- und Einkehrmöglichkeiten vor der Haustür und doch nicht mitten im Tourismustrubel.<br/>Joke ist eine sehr gute Gastgeberin, offen, freundlich und man merkt, dass es ihr Freude macht, wenn sich ihre Gäste wohlfühlen! Trotzdem haben Gastgeber und Gast jeder seine Privatsphäre.<br/>Lieben Dank für alles, Joke!"
8748248,"This was a great place to stay with excellent hosts. There are three flights if stairs but providing you can handle that, I would highly recommend this as a place to stay. A lovely location with a bike rental place just opposite as well as loads of eateries. No bike ride we did to any if the main sites took more than 10 mins. "
8753523,"It's a amazing flat, lovely and with high qualitiy furnished. But the best are the canals around, just sitting at the window and injoy the view!! <br/>what a fantastic experiance. <br/><br/>thants a lot for that possibilitiy.<br/><br/>best regards <br/>julian<br/>"
8756987,"David was a very welcoming host and we felt absolute privacy during the stay. The room is as describe, spacious with loads of sun. Breakfast is nicely provided each morning. The location of the place is perfect, close to central station, walking distance to Jordaan and is literally next door to RLD but still feel peace and quiet. <br/><br/>Only minor complaint I have is that we could hear footsteps from upstairs in early mornings and they sometimes woke us up (we're not particular morning person and also on holiday).<br/><br/>but apart from that it was a perfect stay. "
8766027,"Edwin was really nice ! He has a warm smile and everything went very smoothly :) He was very flexible with my checkout as well, which was very nice of him.<br/>The bedroom is very cute, and the location was PERFECT. <br/>if you want  to stay in the center i definitely recommend this room  Staying at susanne's house was very pleasent. She is a very nice lady and i enjoyed talking with her a lot. The house was beautiful and it was very sweet of her to prepare me a breakfast. i took tram 17 to go into and from the city; very easy. i would definitly recommend staying at her house, and i would love to come back again and stay at her house."
8795521,"We had the most pleasant time staying with  friendly Andrea in her lovely home! The room is beautiful, lovely lighting, personal towels, robes and kettle- perfect for a late night cup of tea before bed! The beds are super comfy too! So close to the metro, five minute walk to there and then a short ride into Amsterdam Centraal station! Andrea also helped us navigate the city and gave us great tips on where to eat and explore! We will definitely be back, 5 stars! Thank you Andrea, two days was not enough! "
8822204,"We absolutely adored Laura's place. The hosts were delightful. The apartment was comfortable, clean, and cozy. The neighborhood was quiet, but also within walking distance of so much. It was perfect for our stay. If you are visiting Amsterdam, Laura's place is highly recommended. "
8843553,"Wir haben die Zeit in Amsterdam sehr genossen. Viola und Daniel haben uns beide beim check in begrüßt und viele hilfreiche Tipps bezüglich der Wohnung und bezüglich Amsterdam. Zusätzlich konnten wir auf zahlreiches Infomaterial zurückgreifen (u.a. ein Reiseführer den wir leider in unserer Tasche vergessen haben; ist schon unterwegs zu euch =))<br/>Das Apartment ist so wie beschrieben und auf den Fotos zu sehen, wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt in unserem zeitweisen Zuhause.<br/>Viola und Daniel waren jederzeit für uns erreichbar"
8847205,My husband and I stayed at wilma's home for 4 days and had a wonderful experience.  Its a compact room on the first floor and has a lovely view of the canals and a windmill in the distance. The tram station connects to dam square and is just a few seconds walk...wilma was a helful and non - intrusive host.  The only minor drawback was that there is no left as its a typical amsterdam home so carrying luggage up the steep steps is a problem if you have heavy bags. But all in all it was a wonderful experience and would recommend it to anyone!
8858219,"O apartamento de fato é otimo!<br/>localizacao perfeita, ao lado do onibus que vai e chega do aeroporto.<br/>Comunicacao otima com os Trams da cidade.<br/>Perto de lojas para alugar bicicleta. Recomendadissimo.<br/>Enfim, o apartamento é otimo.<br/><br/>"
8884565,"Nous avons passé 5 jours sur le bateau de Grietje à 9 dont 5 enfants.<br/>Tout d'abord nous avons eu un très bon accueil de la part de nos hôtes et le logement était conforme aux descriptions.<br/>Un bon point pour la literie et la pièce principale avec un bon aménagement de la cuisine.<br/>Par contre des douches un peu spartiates et des soucis d'évacuation des sanitaires.<br/>Le bateau était amarré dans un quartier calme assez proche du centre."
8888523,"Wendie and Hans were great hosts.<br/>The room is very spacious and private with a connected bathroom and a small balcony.<br/>Although very central and close to the nightlife, the room is very quiet at night. It is close to the museums, clubs, coffee shops, Heineken Experience is just a 5min walk and the Vondelpark too.<br/>Dutch stairs are a particular case but that's the fun of getting to know more cultures and the wifi signal wasn't too strong, maybe the iPhone 5 has a problem.<br/>Nonetheless, I highly recommend due to the location and space available!<br/>"
8914470,"Sella was a wonderful host and so helpful in getting her keys to us. Her apartment too was a wonderful, comfortable and cosy pad to stay in...conveniently located with loads of coffee places, delis and bars within walking distance. The biggest delightful surprise was the street market which magically appeared on Friday and Saturday morning right outside the flat! The food, colours and vibrance was brilliant.<br/>Central Station is only a short tram ride away and the tram stop is less than a minute's walk from the apartment. Getting to and from the airport was also a breeze. <br/>The highlight of our stay at Sella's was sharing our short weekend holiday with Mano the Cat...a long-haired beauty who totally captivated our hearts. <br/>Thank you, Sella, for making my first ever visit and stay in Amsterdam a great one! We'll never tell our little Bobbi that we've been fraternising with foreign cats!!"
8917864,"Toetsie was very welcoming and attentive before and during our stay. The apartment was clean and we had an entire floor to ourselves :) Toetsie's cat Roky was also welcoming and very cute, and kept us company during our whole stay.<br/>The kitchen, while small (no sink, so we'd use the bathroom sinks), was perfectly functional, and we were able to make a few meals. The location is also pretty sweet-- not too many tourists, but still close to a good assortment of restaurants and supermarkets and stores. All in all, a great place for a visit to Amsterdam."
8918973,A very nice flat in a quiet area but not far away from everything.  Very clean flat and would highly recommend staying here to anyone.  Sarah and her parents where very helpfull!  Thank you so much!
8960355,"Personne très sympathique, confiante et surtout disponible pour nous aider!<br/>Parfait pour un concert tardif à l'Arena, Heineken Music Hall ou au Ziggo Dome, proche du metro, on est en ville en 10 minutes!<br/>Ensemble un peu vieillot mais trés convenable!<br/>Nous recommandons!"
8964016,"The house was beautiful, and in a great location. A little small - but I think that is maybe to be expected in Amsterdam. We briefly met Loes and he was lovely and accommodating. It was a great place to stay in Amsterdam."
8978305,Judith's unique home had the personality we look for in a house. Beautiful garden to relax in and enjoy Amsterdam. Location made it easy to access everything we wanted to do. Max and Lola (the cats) were pleasant company. Thank you!
8986780,What a wonderful stay at Hannekes houseboat! We had such a nice and warm welcome on our arrival day. Everything was very easy. We stayed for a long weekend. The houseboat is well located in the beautiful Jordaan so you can reach the City center by foot. The houseboat it well equipped with everything you need and we especially loved the kitchen! We enjoyed the cozy atmosphere with the fancy decoration and all the butterflies. <br/>We can highly recommend a stay at Hannekes woonboot! 
8991780,"Vivian is very helpful and maintains a nice and very clean apartment Sjouke is a helpful, relaxed and easy going host. I had a pleasant time staying with her"
9014061,"Je suis venue avec mon amoureux à Amsterdam pour le we de la Pentecôte, et nous avons passé 3 nuits chez Cornelie. Appart vraiment sympa et original, grandes fenêtres sur le canal, déco géniale, livres de photo partout, bougies et petits objets qui donnent à ce grand loft une touche unique. Lit en mezzanine confortable, belle cuisine, grande baignoire, un appart romantique, parfait pour quelques jours en couple. Corneille était là pour nous accueillir et aussi le jour du départ, souriante et adorable, bref tout était parfait. Last but not least : l'appart est très bien placé, dans le quartier des ""9 canaux"" (à Jordaan), avec plein de petites boutiques, cafés et restos hype. Merci encore Cornelie !"
9028009,"We had a wonderful stay in Femke's apartment - the perfect spot for a long weekend to explore Amsterdam. After welcoming us with cold drinks and stroopwafel (on a very hot day) and giving us a quick tour, she also left some food essentials which was really helpful. Her daughter had also set up toys ready for my little girl, which was lovely, and even more excitingly my daughter got to meet their pet rabbit Hop and help look after him during our stay. He was definitely a highlight and she still calls it 'Hop's house'!<br/>It's very easy to reach from the airport and there are a couple of tram lines within a short walk which take you into the city centre, plus a park and green space very nearby, so it's very peaceful in the evenings. The Vondelpark just a short walk away too and Femke also left us some useful information about attractions and places nearby.<br/>The bathroom was great, very comfy beds and even a fan to use during the heatwave, as well as lots of bedlinen when the temperature dropped. Lots of space for three adults and a toddler. And although the stairs to the third bedroom in the attic were steep, they're fine for an adult, although probably not ideal for younger children. <br/>It was very much a home away from home and I would recommend it to anyone - thanks to Femke for a great place to stay."
9030944,Wonderful apartment in a great location.  Close to train station - but not too close!  Apartment is large and comfortable.  Thanks to Caroline for coordinating a late check in!
9045974,Jorrit's appartment was a great stay! The location is perfect and the space was enough for a weekend. Jorrit's father was a great host to us! I recommend it if you're looking for a cozy centric place.
9054696,"Absolutely great stay! <br/>The sleeping room is not big, but absolutly ok. Just how tehy say: cosy. We could also use the living room with a big couch and the wonderful kitchen! This kitchen has everithing you wish and it´s really nice :-)<br/> We stayed there for 2 nights. It was clean, easy to find, the public transport is near by and Yahav and Deirdre were helpfull ans sympathic hosts. <br/>The only thing, which was not that good were the bikes. The bikes are a good possibility to explore the city, because you can go by bike to the city center from the apt. Yes... the bikes were for free and you can use them when ever you want. We also used them, so it´s not impossible...BUT these bikes are way to old. I didn´t expect new and expensive bikes, but it was no fun to ride them for a longer time... We already told Yahave to look afer them, so maybe they are a bit better and safer for the next guests. <br/>But after all, we can definitely recommend this apt. "
9062317,He is a great personality. Neighborhood is very safe and calming. City Center 25 mins by metro. After midnight bus takes you there in 50 mins.. Thanks Micha :)
9092610,"Rosie welcomed us warmly and helped us get oriented. Directions to the BnB from the airport were easy to follow.  We enjoyed our breakfasts very much. Rosie and her family were friendly, interesting and fun to talk to.  Breakfast was a pancake with choices of topping, a selection of breads with cheese, or butter and jam, a bit of fresh fruit and yogurt, as well as coffee or tea.  The room has a cosy double bed. A television and desk are in front of the balcony window.  The modern bath/shower room next door is shared with the other BnB guest in a single room on the same floor.  The accommodation is in a very attractive, quiet neighbourhood which has a good selection of shops and restaurants. It is superbly located for access to the city centre, the airport and the convention centre at Amsterdam South train station, which is a 15 minute walk from the flat or an easy tram ride.  Trains take about 7 minutes to reach Schiphol Airport."
9093608,"The description was accurate enough for me and Olaf was very welcoming and helpful.  It is clear that he runs a very professional and tight ship.  I was intrigued by his comics and the artwork on the wall.  The design of the flat is wonderful and open with light as he has contributed to it!  I loved the neighborhood and atmosphere, very open and colorful."
9110880,"I loved the little butterfly canal boat! It was cosy but not cramped, comfortable and well equipped, came with its own morning wake up call of ducks splashing. <br/>Shower hot, bed just right, occasional gentle rocking from the canal. <br/>Particularly noticeable were all the small welcoming and thoughtful touches. Arrive thirsty? Sparkling water in the fridge. A bit peckish? Nibbles on the table, chocolates as well! Get a blister on your foot? Band aids and cream in the bathroom. <br/>The only small drawback was a lack of hanging space for clothes but the place was so delightful it didn't matter. <br/>Thank you, Hanneke. "
9120361,"Estuvimos una semana en casa de Joke. La casa es muy bonita y la habitación acogedora, y está en un barrio a 10 minutos del centro con tranvía directo. Desde que llegamos Joke se ofreció para darnos información sobre la ciudad, transportes, lugares de interés... lo que facilitó mucho nuestra visita a Amsterdan (nunca habíamos estado)  Los desayunos en una terracita muy mona, muy completos con productos caseros e incluso algunos ecológicos. Joke es una persona encantadora y muy creativa, recomendamos 100% la estancia en su casa. <br/>Muchos besos Joke!"
9124442,"We LOVED Evert's space...it's an absolutely gorgeous, comfortable room and Evert has added so many special touches to make it that much better!! Thank you Evert!"
9127728,"Mike is a thoughtful and careful person with their guests. The house is exactly as shown in the picture and is a perfect place for those who want to be close to Amsterdam center but also have the opportunity to meet some of the non-tourist routine.<br/><br/>You can enjoy great bars and restaurants nearby as well as walk to the Vondelpark."
9188647,"Wir hatten eine wundervolle Zeit in Cindy's Apartment. Alles war perfekt arrangiert. Die Wohnung ist besitzt hohen Wohnkomfort, ist sehr ästhetisch eingerichtet und ein Traum für alle die gerne kochen. Die angenehme und gemütliche Atmosphäre läd zu ruhigen und erholsamen Stunden der Entspannung ein. Fast ein bisschen Wellness bietet die tolle Dachterasse an sonnigen Tagen und eine schöne große Badewanne bei kalten Temperaturen. Nach anstrengenden Tagestouren freut man sich, immer wieder ""nach Hause"" zu kommen. Die günstige Lage ermöglicht mit der Straßenbahn (zwei Routen) schnell zum Centrum zu gelangen oder über den Vondelpark zu spazieren. Die Abwicklung im Vorfeld war unkompliziert, die Betreuung vor Ort sehr zuvorkommend. Ein rundum stilvoller, herzlicher und fabelhafter Ort um Amsterdam zu entdecken und zu erleben."
9188985,"Olaf was an amazing host! We loved staying in his appartment! He made us feel completely welcomed. Olaf is really funny and you can see he cares about the people coming to his place. <br/>Thank you so much Olaf!"
9198033,"Our stay at Mieke's apartment in Amsterdam was great.  Mieke welcomed us warmly even though we had been delayed and arrived quite late.  The apartment was beautiful and very comfortable and Mieke had provided plenty of useful information.   Location was great, nice to get away from the crowds of Amsterdam.  Public transport was simple and very accessible.  We were very happy with our stay and would highly recommend this place."
9227978,"Barts place is lovely, it is perfectly situated in the quiet north of Amsterdam. It doesn't take long at all to head to the city (via ferry). Furthermore Bart has a great taste in furniture which made our stay really comfy. If we were to go back to Amsterdam we would definitely stay at Bart's again. Thank you very much!"
9257395,"A fabulous place to stay.  Quiet and cozy, all that you need for a relaxing visit.  Within easy walking distance to all that Amsterdam has to offer.   Laura is an excellent and friendly host.  Cannot recommend this place highly enough!  "
9264061,"It was a nice and lovely stay in the Marga&Rico's guesthouse. The place is a little paradise, really quiet and relax. You can reach downtown really easily by bike (you can rent bikes directly at Marga and Rico).<br/>Marga and Rico give you the feel of ""make yourself at home""."
9290436,"Toetsie's place is amazing! We spent two nights in this sweet apartment in a great little neighbourhood just a short walk from the city centre. It couldn't have been better! Toetsie was a great host and made sure that we had everything we needed including maps, travel tips and great breakfast fixings before we headed out. Toetsie even left us a complimentary bottle of wine and juice which was really thoughtful! The room was really comfortable, very clean and facilities were great. Huge thumbs up and I would definitely recommend staying here!"
9300021,"An amazing experience in the house of Rob and Fang.<br/>This Family was so nice and Helpful.<br/>At the moment of our arrival Rob  give us a map of the city and had illustrate us the most important and nice places to visit in the City.<br/>The Room is so original and all of  you need you can will be find in the wardrobe.<br/>The kitchen, the shower and the frige you will find in the wardrobe.<br/>An enjoyable experience, i suggest to stay in this house for your stay in Amsterdam.<br/><br/>Thank you so much Rob and Fang!<br/><br/>Ambra"
9301343,"We stayed only one night @ Toetsie's place but we've really enjoyed it! It's only a 10-15 min bike ride to the city center and close to Oosterpark some a'dam bars. <br/>Toetsie's communication and service was very good. There were sandwiches, eggs, juice and wine on arrival. We didn't get the chance to meet because of busy schedules but maybe next time!<br/>Recommended!<br/>"
9358081,"Toetsie really helped me out when I needed a place to sleep at the last minute. She welcomed me into her beautiful home and made sure I had everything I needed for a very comfortable stay. I didn't get to enjoy the roof because it was raining, but it looks like a great place to relax. Roky is her sweetheart cat who loves to curl up next to visitors. I'd love to stay here again the next time I'm in Amsterdam!"
9366573,"I just stayed at Petra's apartment for 5 days. The first thing you notice when you open the door is how CLEAN the apartment is. There is no kitchen, as she states, but there is a small fridge, an electric kettle, toaster and microwave. The instant coffee and powdered milk were enough for me to get my morning going, and I bought some things at a nearby supermarket that were perfect for feeling like home. My favorite part was coming home at the end of the day to a warm home, lighting the candles around the tub, and soaking in hot bubbles for a while. I did not want to be in the center of all of the noise and action, and Petra's home is very convenient to the train, and two major tram lines that bring you to the city center in 20 minutes or less. I liked living in a quiet, safe, residential neighborhood, and the price is attractive. There are also neighborhood restaurants. Petra is a great hostess, and was most kind and accommodating to me when my flight came in even later than expected. She was very helpful to me whenever I needed any information or assistance. I highly recommend this listing. "
9373690,"Daniella is a great host and the apartment of her is very clean. I felt very well- my room was modern and had all comfort, the Wifi was very fast and WC and bath were very clean and in modern style.<br/>Just one Tram stop away from Metro 50 the location is well connected to RAI, Amsterdam Zuid Business Area and the with the tram to historical center of Amsterdam ( 15 min ). To get from Airport to Daniella no Taxi is needed:by Train and Metro you can reach here. Gina ist eine tolle Gastgeberin, die flexibel auf Wünsche reagiert. Das Zimmer war wie beschrieben zum kleinen Garten hinaus gelegen und ruhig. Gut war auch dass ich die Küche und das Wohnzimmer mit benutzen konnte. Bad und WC waren zur gemeinschaftlichen Nutzung und sauber. Das WLAN war sehr gut. Die Lage der Wohnung ist sehr gut denn vom Bahnhof oder Flughafen einfach zu erreichen. Unmittelbar in der Umgebung liegt der Westerpark und beginnt die Haarmelerdijk- Strasse mit vielen kleinen Boutiquen und Restaurants. Gleich um die Ecke auch das Resto und Bar ""de Willem"". Der Bio Bauernmarkt am Noordermarkt ist in 10 min zu Fuss zu erreichen."
9374670,Great location and very spacious apartment.
9385105,"Remco is a great and friendly guy. <br/>We stayed in his place for a weekend and it was great: bright, clean and fully equipped apartment. Great location and beautiful view. Absolutely love it. "
9392321,"Ed was a most thoughtful and considerate host. He was super responsive and provided me with so many great options for places to eat. He was extremely warm and stocked up the fridge with beautiful organic products. <br/><br/>The apartment is stunning. It's tastefully decorated and Ed and his partner have clearly thought of everything. It's the perfect size studio, elegant and eclectic, clean, and honestly a dream place to stay. I LOVED it! This is the second time that I stay here and I love it. Ed is a wonderfully warm and welcoming host and the place is spectacular.  This is my third time staying here. It's my favourite Place in Amsterdam and Ed is a wonderful host! "
9403297,Matthijs was an excellent host! He greeted us with a warm welcome on our arrival. All communications prior to and during stay were easy and friendly. He had fantastic suggestions on where to go and what to do. His home is as described in the listing - lovely and walking distance from everything! Would love to stay again next time we visit Amsterdam!
9415307,"We were received by Boris and his sons at their newly built appartement in the fashionable, hip, neighbourhood of Amsterdam called ""De Pijp"".  Good reception, very friendly and personal, and the appt is clean, spacious and modern; the bunk beds a bit tough for grown-up's and the rooftop terrace quite small, but very pleasant overall. Big point of attention is the plumbing : none of the toilets worked properly due to lack of waterfilling...quite a disturbance and disappointing in a new appartment. Apart from this we had a great time and we were lucky with the weather. We also struggle with the logic of advertising for Euro 250 per night for the whole appartment -plus cleaning and deposit fees- only to find out that for every person over two you have to pay Euro 50 extra per night, so in fact the appartment for six is Euro 450 and not Euro 250 per night...is that allowed by Airbnb?! <br/><br/>"
9420517,"Побывали в Амстердаме в октябре 2015. Город прекрасен, и даже прогулки под дождем, не омрачили наше прибывание. О квартире и хозяине. Олаф очень доброжелателен, и приятный хозяин. Напоил нас кофе с датскими вафлями. Ещё до приезда, координировал нас на счёт парковок и удобства въезда в город. Рассказал о достопримечательностях Амстердама, отвечал на наши вопросы. Квартира, конечно не в самом центре, но район спокойный и милый, до центра пешком около получаса, но очень приятно погулять по каналам, посмотреть по сторонам. И, для заинтересованных-кофешоп в соседнем подъезде, открыт круглосуточно, но людей заходящих или выходящих из него мы не видели. В общем мульт-квартирка в милом райончике Амстердама. С душевным хозяином:) "
9429595,"Thank you for a lovely stay, your apartment is beautiful and we really felt at home for the weekend. Perfect for our group of 3 couples for the weekend and everything was as described "

9523392,"Hanneke's houseboat was in the perfect location!  Close to everything, but on one of the quieter canals. What a unique experience; can't recommend it enough. Bonus: the shower had surprisingly great water pressure!<br/><br/>Hanneke was a lovely host and very accessible if we needed anything."
9523422,"El departamento Vondel House, Guest Room 2, es un lugar muy bien provisto para brindar al huésped el descanso durante el viaje.

9546080,"Toetsie's place is great!<br/><br/>We had a great time and Toetsie was really helpful and extremely generous. We had an entire floor to ourselves and when we arrived, there was even wine on the bed as a welcome gift. Staying there made our time in Amsterdam so much more enjoyable and comfortable. She helped us with public transit and offered to let us use her bikes. I wish I could give more than 5 stars because I was blown away by Toetsie's hospitality and wonderful home. Thank you!!!<br/><br/>p.s. Toestie, your cat is awesome"
9551272,"The host, S, was not available on the day of our arrival but she gave clear instructions on how to go to her apartment and we had an easy check in. The room is okay but it seemed a bit crowded because the bed and the TV cabinet are big. The two of us had difficulty moving around with our luggages. The bedroom and the toilet doors don't have a lock. It was not a concern to us but others may find it uncomfortable. The location is far from the museums and Jordaan neighborhood but there's a nearby tram station to the house. S was flexible, friendly and accomodating. And we loved doing belly rubs to her cute, playful cat!"
9551982,"Great location for my two day stay! Close to Amsterdam Central Station, amongst many other things. Room and bathroom is clean, wi-fi is good. A really good breakfast place round the corner (Omelegg). "
9559183,"Toetsie welcomed us in her home with arms wide open. It was always warm, cosy and clean and feels very welcoming. <br/>If you are a lover of art you should deffinately stay here since her place is full of colour, sculptures, books and paintings. She guided us on what we could visit and made us feel very at home.<br/>Deffinately a place we will come back to.<br/><br/>"
9570961,"The apartment was really nice, close to tram and in a lovely neighborhood. Some surprises nevertheless : no TV (despite the pictures of a TV in the add), no hamac and a really smelly garbage in the bathroom. <br/>"
9585488,Sjoukje's place is amazing and in a great location! The bed is super comfortable and her living room is lovely and airy. Her cat Naz is the cutest little thing I've ever seen! The check in process was really simple and Sjoukje gave great directions to her place. The area has lots of lovely bars and restaurants nearby and the centre of town is walkable from her place. I would definitely stay with her again!
9592955,"Toetsie's place was comfortable and just what I needed - a place to sleep after being out in the city most of the day. Though I did not meet Toetsie, she was helpful and responded quickly via email, and Angel and Teresa were there to greet me and get me set up. A nice touch was having coffee, wine, snacks etc available. If you're travelling alone and need a place to lay your head, I'd happily recommend Casa Vrolik. "
9601877,"Very unique, homey apartment in the heart of a fun district. Great restaurants and bars just around the corner. Cozy space with interesting knickknacks, record player, and so close to everything! Mas & Carl are very inviting and truly make you feel welcome in the city. Private little stoop where you can eat & drink in the evening just like your Dutch neighbors."
9606587,"This apartment is just what we needed - close to the centre,  calm and neat. Toetsie wasn`t there when we arrived, but she managed everything so nicely, that we had everything we needed and felt care and warmth.<br/>There is a cool park in english style, just in few minutes walk, eco-supermarket, very good cheese-shop ""Eric`s"" and nice bars<br/><br/>The room is small, but comfortable- great bed,all the things you may need as towels,slippers,shampoo and so on. <br/> <br/>Highly recommended"

9674093,Apartment was great. Nice spot. Introduction and walk through was a nice touch. 
9675548,"We had a great time in Maaike's house. We made the reservation on the morning of the check in because of a cancellation by our original host and Maaike really saved us. She made us feel very welcome in her house and really spoiled us (leaving a wine bottle and snacks for us). The place itself is huge and really charming- it looks exactly like in the pictures, and we fell in love with her adorable cat. There is a big shopping center near by and some tram lines that can take you to the city center (a 20 minutes ride) and a train station that can take you directly to the airport which was great. Thank you Maaike for a wonderful experience. "
9703997,"Toetsie is a kind and warmhearted host. She did everything to make our stay as pleasant as possible we felt at home in her place. We had a lovely stay, slept well and were able to prepare some simple meals when we wanted to. Access to town is great by foot or tram. The house is clean and lovely to come home to after a day out and about in Amsterdam. We also enjoyed cuddles and visits from Roky the cat!<br/>Greetings and thanks to the two and four legged hosts at Casa Vrolik."
9708890,"The host has checked with me with a good period of time for us to be prepared, and checked so that we could get the key even if we got lost on our way from the airport. The house is amazing, it feels that the owners have own relaxed and classy taste. 6 people can be hosted there easily and everybody can get own room. The bedroom on the 4th floor made us feel we stay in a castle. The big terrass on the roof is wonderful, too! The owner's cat Sophie is cute, too, very sociable and easy, and she is used to the guests. <br/>The area is amazing, so many nice restaurants, shops, good communications and still, it is not a busy tourist centre. We could really enjoy the breath of real Amsterdam, thank you Ellen!<br/>"
9721432,"The stay at Edwin's house was awesome. Neat and clean. Right in the middle of everything. Excellent communication. Don't think will find a better place than Edwin's in Amsterdam at this price. <br/>Just bring earplugs if you are a light sleeper. <br/>Thanks, Edwin, for the wonderful stay. Cheers Everything was satisfactory. Will recommend."
9755875,"Hello to all. I was very impressed by the fact that this apartment had a lot of positive feedback , but my stay was not so . Upon arrival, Judith showed us the apartment , and found the refrigerator full ( already not very big ) with only one shelf you can use for free as many as 5 people! This has created many problems. Not to mention the check-out where we were practically thrown out , fixed at the last minute to 5 pm, and instead Judith anticipated at 3 pm . We have not even had time to tidy up the house and our belongings , we found that the bags made, and on the sidewalk, then you are also allowed to put our hands in our suitcases.<br/>After being treated in this way we also received complaints from Judith false we made noise until 4 am, when we were very careful about this , and of course being in holiday we could not even stay awake until one o'clock in the morning because woke up us soon.<br/>I was very disappointed by this host, and if I knew who it was so I would never have made ​​this reservation .  <br/><br/>In response to Judith: It is not true that we arrived at 5 but at 3 o'clock, and she was already inside the apartment dall1 and was allowed to open the bags to put our things inside. We would have liked to put in order the show (which was not as dimensioned) and our things, but we were not allowed for these reasons. Not to mention the fact that the 4 new guests were already present in the apartment and check out was at 5. According to being paying customers expect it to be the prerogative of the owner to make available the refrigerator for up to 5 people, such as cleaning, having paid € 30 for cleaning."
9757255,"Soggiorno assolutamente fantastico! Io e la mia ragazza siamo rimasti molto contenti della scelta fatta. Matthijs è squisito, sempre disponibile ad un consiglio o un aiuto per quello che riguarda la città. La stanza è calda, accogliente e pulita; la posizione è perfetta, nel cuore della città. Un'altra cosa che ci è piaciuta moltissimo è la colazione: servita in un posticino molto carino a pochi minuti a piedi, sempre buonissima e abbondante. Se dovessimo ritornare ad Amsterdam, sicuramente ritorneremo da Matthijs e Francina."
9766833,"Ottima location, resa ancora più interessante dai suggerimenti perfetti di Corina (soprattutto su dove mangiare la colazione). È la situazione ideale per un weekend lungo. "
9790990,"It was my first AIRBNB experience and I'm sure there's for far the best starting experience!<br/>Karlijn is an excellent hostess, she knows the best tips of Amsterdam and in addition she really takes her time with explaining the way to get to this or that place.<br/>The apartment is located in a peaceful and cute neighborhood.<br/>Everything inside it's perfectly clean and decorated with a cute and clean lines taste.<br/>I'm really looking to come back to Karlijn's house as soon as possible! <br/><br/>I recommend Karlijn's place for a peaceful and happy stay in Amsterdam.

9832165,"Staying in Mishca's apartment was an absolute delight. We were a little nervous when we didn't see any reviews before we booked but there was nothing to worry about! I've stayed at many AirBnb throughout the world and this was by far the best  overall. The apartment was in an excellent location. It's super easy to get to by tram (just half a block away) from the tram station. Most places were just walking distance. The apartment itself is really cozy and comfortable. There was a full bedroom and the sofa in the living room turns into a full bed so it's great for 2-4 people. The best part of the Apartment was that there was a sweet terrace to hang out with table and chairs. Her apartment is right next to this one so it was very convenient if and when we needed any help or had questions. <br/> Mischa was a great host. She checked up on us at various points before we arrived and gave us all the info to get to her place. She prepared an amazing guide with restaurants, attractions and any info you would need when visiting. She stocked the fridge with beer, wine, soda, and water. The closet had a bunch of snacks, breakfast bars, coffee, etc... All of this was up for grabs! The wifi wasn't so great the first day but when we told her she moved the router for us and it was great afterwards! <br/>I highly recommend staying here. It's much better than staying at a hotel :) "
9851356,"Tamira´s hospitality was perfect and wornderful. In time sent us a detailed email which did include all necessary information about the house, its location and the most appropriate way from Amsterdam Central station to Ijburg. In addition she did recommend us many good restaurants and must-see locations. Upon our late arrival we found a fridge which contained food for breakfast a bottle of delicious wine to recover from our journey. A really warm welcome for guests. "
9881061,Heleen greeted us with a warm welcome and set us up with good street and transport maps along with clear explanations of how to get around in Amsterdam. The apartment is a little outside city centre but very navigable with public transport. 
9882570,"Sarah-Jane & her place were the absolute best. We travelled to five cities on our trip and this was our favorite place to stay ! The location in Jordaan was ideal. Its located in a quiet neighborhood with a lot of boutiques, restaurants & stores. Her home was just outside of the city centre, just a short walk away from Dam square. Check-In with Sarah was flawless and her communication was always on point. The apartment is the cutest thing you've ever seen and stocked with all the kitchen, bath and linens you could imagine.  The entire flat was clean and well kept. The bathroom and shower were comfortable and well above standard. Central heating and hot water was the best we experienced in all of Europe. This place is 10x better than staying in a hotel anywhere in Amsterdam. The bed is sensational, you melt right into it! This place is everything! Thank you Sarah-Jane.<br/>  <br/>- Adam & Leah"
9893597,"Fantastic place to stay. Plenty of room. Safe and handy.<br/><br/>Nicolet was very helpful and accommodating at check-in and check-out. The whole process went extremely smoothly. <br/><br/>The location is very convenient for trips to the Hermitage, Red Light District, Flower Market, Rijksmuseum, Dam square etc. etc. <br/><br/>Having stayed in Amsterdam many times, I would say that this is about the best place I've stayed in terms of local charm/street noise/convenience etc. Perfect for a family or for people who want to be near everything but not slap bang in the central ""hustle bustle streets"" between Dam Square and OudeKerk. In fact, the location is much better than that of many so-called luxury hotels. <br/><br/>There are a number of supermarkets nearby (we used the Albert Heijn at Nieuwmarkt - 8 mins away), and plenty of cafes and bars to provide whatever sustenance is required after a long day's walking around the beautiful city. The very next street - Staalstraat - has a nice chocolate shop, deli and a bar etc. Very picturesque.<br/><br/>We had solid wi-fi (perfect to occupy the kids) and the range of cutlery and kitchen equipment was more than adequate to allow us to cook up some great meals in the evenings. Necessities like sugar, salt, oil and tea/coffee were there which meant that we only needed to buy the raw materials and not all sundry condiments when cooking.<br/><br/>We would stay there again without hesitation."
9894443,"Het ruime familiehuis van Celeste en Frans is een zaligheid om in te verblijven, bij aankomst kregen we een rondleiding van alles wat het huis te bieden heeft ( alles wat je kan wensen!). De woonkamer is prachtig, open keuken erbij wat perfect is voor een gezellige avond. Het tuintje is zeker en vast een meerwaarde om tot rust te komen na een dagje city trip in Amsterdam. Ik kan iedereen dit verblijf ten zeerste aanraden. Indien ik nogmaals in Amsterdam kom zal ik zeker terug naar hier komen! I can advise everyone to stay at this beautiful place, perfectly located in Amsterdam. "
9904015,"David is kind and helpful, the room is very beautiful and clean with an amazing view, recommended!!!"
9910742,"We were very happy with the apartment. Great for kids, especially kids who love bunnies! Lovely places to eat and drink around the apartment. Overall a fun experience! Thanks. "
9936437,"We had an AMAZING time, thanks to this beautiful cozy apartment we felt 'at home away from home'!<br/><br/>As soon as we arrived (very early in the morning) Jan gave us a warm friendly welcome, showed us around the apartment and gave us great tips, info & some sight-seeing ideas.<br/><br/>The apartment was the perfect size for my partner & I.<br/>Great kitchen with everything you would ever need.<br/>Beautiful bedroom, good large bed, big windows, tv/dvd & warm in the winter.<br/>Well designed bathroom with washing machine, big bath & shower.<br/>But by far the spacious living room was our favourite place to relax on the couch, dine and enjoy the view from the large windows.<br/>It was great to have fast Wifi, and central heating throughout the home too. <br/><br/>We watched the New Year fireworks from the living room and it was wonderful.<br/><br/>The location is perfect, nice and quiet yet a small walk into the main town, shopping & restaurants. Its close to trams and taxi stations, public transport to help you get around or to & from the airport. <br/><br/>We highly recommend this apartment & i hope to be back again soon! :) <br/><br/>***** Five stars!<br/><br/> I go to Amsterdam twice a year and i stayed on a couple different apartments, but i never had such an amazing time as i had in Jurjen's apartment, the place is comfy, beautiful, spacious and very clean.<br/><br/>The area where is located is prime with restaurant, supermarkets and Coffeshop at walking distance.<br/><br/>He has a really good Coffee machine that in my case is essential.<br/><br/>for sure i'm going back and staying there for many years to come.<br/><br/>Thank you Jurjen for the good times and for the welcoming bottle of wine.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"
9966877,"Staying at Angelo's place was an overall awesome experience.<br/><br/>Angelo is a constantly smiling, super helpful, friendly guy (great communication!) and the apartment looks exactly as depicted in the listing. It is located in a residential area, within a 10-15 minute bike ride to the most vibrant parts of the city. For me, this was a perfect combo, enabling me to enjoy the best of both: feeling like a local and having the possibility to become a tourist in virtually no time.<br/><br/>Would absolutely recommend to anyone and when I'm coming back to Amsterdam, I will definitely be considering staying here again!"
9967399,"Ruime, gezellige woning. Alle comfort aanwezig. Ideale ligging. Perfect om met kinderen Amsterdam te bezoeken. Volgende keer komen we zeker terug. "
9970354,"Pour notre premier séjour via airbnb, nous sommes bien tombés puisque Roel a été un super hôte !<br/>Il nous a donné de bon conseils comme des restaurants, des supermarchés, les quartiers à visiter et même un endroit où garer sa voiture gratuitement !<br/>Concernant l'appartement il est très bien situé, juste à coté d'un arrêt de tramway et à 10-15min du centre d'amsterdam. Il est très confortable avec un très grand choix de cd audio, livres etc etc.<br/>Il possède également un chat (bob) qui est très gentil, propre, il faut juste lui donner à manger.<br/>Pour finir, pour ceux qui seraient intéressés à venir faire un séjour sur Amsterdam je ne peux que vous conseiller de choisir cet appartement."
9991652,Toetsie is a great host and person. Glad with my stay at her house.
10028899,Great stay. Loved the apartment. Good location. Owners were very helpful and flexible. Overall we enjoyed the experience a lot
10033362,I want to thank Fenno for our great time in Amsterdam! He was incredibly friendly host! He has a perfect apartment in quiet district. It is located not far from city center and you can easily get there by foot or bus or even taxi :). He gave us all information which helped us to find some interesting places. Unfortunately we didn't meet but he was ready to help us anytime.
10049537,"My wife and I arrived from the U.S. for our first time in Amsterdam. We were warmly greeted by Wilma and her family and promptly given a tour of her beautiful home. The room was perfect, we had our own floor, and she thought of everything we would need throughout our week's stay. The location was excellent for accessing public transportation and exploring the city on foot. We would absolutely recommend Wilma's home, and it is definitely on our list of destinations to return to. Cheers!"
10060917,"We had an excellent stay at Hans and Wendie's place for 6 nights in Winter time. <br/>Their travel instructions were accurate and easy to follow and they updated us when ever necessary. Check in was easy, friendly and Hans took the time to give us a great break down of possible places to visit based on our overall plans for our stay. The room was clean and warm, the shower pressure excellent and there was excellent quality coffee and tea available. The Wifi was reliable.<br/>The location was perfect being in between central and the old town and the museum district. Right on a tram line and lots of great cafe's and restaurants at the doorstep! <br/>We would definitely stay again.<br/>"
10085568,"We absolutely loved Marlene's apartment just west of Amsterdam Central station. Location was great, close to a shopping strip, and just across the road from a tram stop. It was so nice inside with great furnishings, and comfortable to reach since it was only on the first floor! So bright, and spacious for the two of us. We appreciated the bottle of wine too :) Thanks Marlene!"
10093942,"We absolutely loved staying at Vibeke's place! Vibeke did everything for our stay. Her communication was clear, she helped us with directions, her place was absolutely great: lots of space, clean, welcoming. I cannot recommend her place more. You cannot go wrong!"
10102066,"My partner and I stayed on the Pantheos houseboat for a long weekend at the end of November. We had a wonderful break: this houseboat is marvellous. The location is ideal; the boat is warm and comfortable, with everything we could need (great terrace, well equipped kitchen, a music system, good bathroom etc.); the hosts were friendly, efficient, and laid back (relaxed about late check-out, left us food and drinks, etc.). We would love to return!        "
10124534,"Lovely boat in Amsterdam, everything you need is in the boat!<br/>Thank you so much Marietta :)"
10140186,"Great place and centrally located. Esther was always there to make us feel welcomed and to provide any information we needed about the city. Thin walls, so make sure you keep it down a bit."
10169225,"I didn't sleep into this room but another one of the flat. Hetty is such a great person ! Discussions with her are very interesting ! I felt very comfortable and had everything I need, even more ! (food, drinks, etc.)<br/>The flat is located 15/20 mins walk from the RAI, in a quiet quarter of amsterdam. Relaxing time !"
10189950,"When my sister and I arrived at the boat we were greeted by Bop who instantly made us feel welcome and relaxed. He's a very friendly, laid back guy with a great sense of humour.<br/>The boat was even better than we imagined and we wish we could have spent more of our time enjoying it however we were only staying for three nights and had a lot to explore in Amsterdam! The apartment is super clean and beautifully decorated. The fridge was stocked with milk, eggs, fruit juice, homemade jam, a couple of beers and a bottle of fizz which was a lovely touch. The shower was powerful and stayed hot - better than the one I have at home.<br/>The location of the boat is great - it's far enough out from the centre to be quiet and peaceful and the views are stunning with the windmill nearby. Even though it was freezing, we enjoyed a coffee on the deck in the sun in the mornings - it would be amazing to do this in the summer time!! Even though there are bus stops very close nearby, we enjoyed the half hour walk to the centre and back every day because there's so much to see and take in.<br/>It was great to experience staying on a boat and made our stay in Amsterdam that little bit more special.<br/>I would highly recommend staying here to anyone!<br/>Thanks again Bop, Eve & Sil!"
10195693,"Мы жили несколько дней у Vibeke.Все понравилось.Хозяйка очень дружелюбная и сделала все ,чтобы нам было комфортно.Можно готовить на кухне,рядом всякие магазины .Недалеко от аэропорта и до центра можно быстро доехать.Комната соответствует описанию.Мы прекрасно провели время!"

A big thank you !"
10205351,"Il nostro soggiorno da Jeremie è stato fantastico: la casa è piccola ma accogliente e dotata di tutto. La location è perfetta! Nel cuore del quartiere De Pijp, brulicante di vita a qualsiasi ora!<br/>Il check in è stato perfetto, Jeremie ci ha aspettato davanti all'appartamento nonostante il nostro aereo avesse oltre un'ora di ritardo. La prima mattina del soggiorno Jeremie ci ha persino portato i cornetti :) <br/>Solo due piccoli difetti: la pulizia della casa, benchè sufficiente, non era eccezionale e contattare Jeremie durante il soggiorno non è sempre stato semplice."
10222186,"I stayed only one night at Toetsie's beautiful house but I really enjoyed her place and Amsterdam. I arrived very early morning but she welcomed me!  I stayed single room, it was so sweet, cozy and clean. I was able to sleep well!  She invited me upstairs with coffee and brealfast. The roof was amazing! I enjoyed nice view! And the diningroom was also nice, cozy and beautful. I felt relax and enjoyed talking with her.<br/>I loved the place! Thank you."
10231854,"Thank you so much Mijef for letting us stay in your lovely room. It was perfect for what we needed and so central to the city, we were able to walk everywhere :) The room was as described, large and welcoming. Thanks again, & we would definitely stay again when we next visit Amsterdam in the future. "
10232607,"Nous avons passé de très agréables vacances, l'appartement était conforme à l'annonce... Nous avons reçu un accueil chaleureux et l'aménagement de la maison est idéal pour passer de belles vacances en famille sans être les uns sur les autres car nous étions 6 personnes. Nous nous sentions comme à la maison!...<br/>Le quartier est très calme et très agréable, il se trouve au bord d'un canal et est à quelques minutes à pied du centre ville.<br/>Nous gardons les coordonnées de cet appartement car nous espérons pouvoir retourner à Amsterdam qui est une ville où il fait bon vivre !"
10269004,"We spend a marvellous moment in the city, and Bronte is a wonderful host !<br/>She made everything perfectly clear so we can easily find her place from the station.<br/>Her house is a very nice place to stay, everything was perfect!<br/>If I ever come back in Amsterdam, I would like to come in her place again !<br/>Thank you for everything<br/>Gem"

10326485,"L'appartement est très bien situé, il est grand et très équipé. <br/>Jolie terrasse et tout peut se faire à pied.<br/>Le quartier est trendy et pour les shops c'est parfait.<br/>Idéal"
10338603,The appartment is a little bit off the center. But in a positive way to relax from the stress in the city. You need 30 min the central station with tram. 20 with sub and you can walk in 30 minutes to the pijp. The appartment was nice. We got 3 keys and a couple of beers + some food in the fridge as a welcome present. All in all I can recommend it
10351605,"Hello! Rosie! Sorry for the late reply!<br/>It's my first time n first stay in Holland at Rosie hm, me n mum both enjoy the 4 nights at yr hm, as we got late flight arrived in Ams n don't know the direction , Rosie came to tram station to pick us up, thx a lot!

And nice to know u  n yr husband n son too! ;-)  take care!"
10359431,Very nice hosts of a centrally located and surprisingly quiet room. Would book this place any time again when in Amsterdam for a few days. Sharing a bathroom was ok. And the breakfast is fantastic!
10364356,"Tutto perfetto, la casa era esattamente come presentata sull'annuncio, bella, nuova, pulita e completamente accessoriata, purtroppo abbiamo avuto dei problemi con il riscaldamento, abbiamo chiamato l'agenzia ma, la persona che è venuta non è stata in grado di risolverlo per cui in una delle camere da letto il riscaldamento non funzionava e nell'altra parte della casa funzionava a metà , abbiamo ovviato usando due piumoni.  Questo è stato l'unico problema, non piccolo naturalmente pensando al clima della città nel periodo del nostro soggiorno. Ma la casa ed il quartiere mi hanno conquistata, dovendo tornare spesso ad Amsterdam cercherò di tornare nella stessa casa."
10384652,It was a very very nice stay in amsterdam and recommended in any case!!
10403100,"Rosie, is  a wonderful Host,she made me feel very comfortable in her <br/>beautiful house and everything was perfect.The room is quite big  with a very comfy bed. <br/>The local area is  nice and have a lot of facilities as transport,bar, good restaurants, coffee shops and also walk able<br/><br/>I really enjoyed my stay in Rosie 's house and I 100 % recommend  <br/>If I will be back to Amsterdam I will definitely stay in her place  "
10415285,"The studio is light, very clean, charming and spacious, and has everything you need to have a great stay in Amsterdam. The mattress was comfortable and there were lots of thoughtful touches such as a hairdryer, maps, guidebooks, umbrellas, napkins and even mints! The wi-fi is fast and easy to connect.<br/>The neighbourhood is on the edge of the Jordaan - it's peaceful but has quite a few little groceries, bakeries, coffeshops and cafes. You can walk into the city centre from the flat - it's an interesting walk over canals, bridges and amazing buildings. If you'd rather get public transport, the number 10 tram runs every 10 minutes and goes to the museums, galleries, shops and centre, and the 21 bus goes to the Central Station, medieval centre and red light district. Everything is close by. <br/>We usually walked into the centre, but one day we bought a 24 travel ticket (you can buy on tram and use on any mode of transport) and went to look round different neighbourhoods. Another recommendation is if you want to visit the Anne Frank house, go late at night (it is often open until 10pm), and then you will avoid queueing for hours. <br/>Laurence, the host, was very warm and welcoming - she took the time to explain how things in the flat operated and where things were. Laurence speaks French, Dutch, English and probably some other languages too! She and her husband live in the flat upstairs and said we only needed to press the buzzer if we needed anything. They were very unobtrusive and we came and went as we pleased.  When I did need to contact Laurence during our stay, I emailed and she answered immediately. <br/>Overall, we loved the flat, loved the area and loved Amsterdam. I would highly recommend staying here. "
10435110,"Margo was great from the beginning with offering a lift to the place from the station during the evening, when it is somewhat difficult to work out how to get there by walking, although walking from the place during the day is very very easy and not too far from the station at all.<br/>The room itself was really really comfortable... :-)<br/>A nice place to be in, just on the edge of the main central areas..."
10483944,"A perfect stay. <br/>Sjoukje was not here when we arrived and we only saw her when we left. However, everything went smoothly from the beginning to the end, thanks to her precious instructions. We found the location very easily. It is really well situated, near the tram, even though we spent the weekend walking or biking to enjoy the beauty of the Amsterdam. <br/>The place was very clean and full of life, the bed was huge and comfortable, sheets and towels were perfect, as were the bathroom, toilets and kitchen. <br/>The building could not be safer and peaceful, which made us feel very comfortable. <br/>Last, but not least, our trip would not have been the same without Naz, the cat who lives here. It is impossible to not like him. We took care of him while Sjoukje was away, and we are already missing him. He was the highlight of our trip. <br/>Thanks again Sjoukje, hug Naz for us, and see you soon ! "
10488220,Marga and her family were warm to me. I liked staying in their place. Thanks
10489248,"We had a great stay in David's B&B. The room is decorated lovely and is in such a central location. Our breakfast basket was always ready and waiting for us on time. He had thought of everything we might need, and the room was very clean. Thank you David! "
10494040,"Literally walking distance from the train station, located right in the center of old town area, lots of great restaurants, shops and bars nearby. It's convenient for you to visit most of the places in town.<br/>Room was clean and big enough for the two of us. the mini fridge and cattle came in handy. David and his friend was friendly and helpful, they allowed us to keep the luggages in the hallway on the last day.  "
10494551,"Wilma's place was absolutely lovely and so was she. So easy to get to and from downtown with the public transportation, and the neighborhood was safe and quiet overlooking one of the canals. It was beautiful had so much natural light, was clean, cute and quaint. <br/><br/>The bed was comfortable, we had some snacks, tea, coffee & dishes available and the bathroom was beautiful and clean. <br/><br/>The only downside was that, while this is technically it's own studio, it is still a level within Wilma's home and it is a family home. Her son is adorable but did manage to wake us up a few times in the early morning and evening when we went to bed early or wanted to sleep in. <br/><br/>Also there is a cat. Possibly the cutest cat known to mankind and gentle and friendly, but I hadn't seen mention of her before, so I thought I'd add it in.<br/><br/>Would highly recommend Andrea's place to anyone!"
10512798,"It was a very pleasant stay in Amsterdam with Derek and Imman. Check in was easy and the instructions to arrive were very clear.<br/>The room was very clean and comfortable and is perfect for solo travelers that want to avoid loud hostels but still want to be a reasonable distance to the center. <br/>Since there wasn't any access to the kitchen, a mini fridge would have been a nice addition to store some food as options near by were somewhat limited.<br/>Overall, I enjoyed my stay and was very comfortable."
10529411,"Nice experience in a smart little appartment; everything was fine, we had a great time"
10535716,"Claudia made us feel very welcome as soon as we arrived at The Flying Pancake.  She helped us with our luggage and showed us how to work everything in our room.  She have us recommendations for restaurants in the local area and was available whenever we had questions.  The neighborhood and rooms are great.  The neighborhood is a short walk from Amsterdam's attractions and on a quiet street, which was very nice at night and in the evenings.  My husband and I enjoyed the breakfast Claudia provided and wouldn't hesitate to stay at The Flyig Pancake if we get the opportunity to visit Amsterdam again!"
10605762,"Loved this unit! The market and restaurants just around the corner are great, along with the beautiful park a block away. The host offered two free museum passes and a wonderful guide for the home with everything you need. The back room is a little small but there is so much space I'm this unit with two other couches / one could be a bed I believe. The dining room and courtyard area are very cozy and unique. The unit is close to a great market and just a few tram stops (or 15 min walk) to the center. I'm staying at another unit now right in the center and I preferred this one because where I'm at now are crazy tourists and with this unit it had more of a neighborhood feel. I would stay here again for sure!"
10609584,"Very good location. Not in the crowded touristic place but in the city center at the same time. Few small restaurants are just round the corner. <br/>Very hospitable host. You don't need to ask him twice. <br/>Very clean and cozy apartment. Can not mention the bed. It is better than some 5 stars hotels have. Actually the apartment is very close to good hotel standard. Plus you get the fully equipped kitchen with small espresso machine and even with a coffee!!! <br/><br/>P.S. Don't forget to rent a bike. It is a must. One of rental offices is just in five minutes walk from the apartment. "
10631774,"Marga was very warm, welcoming and flexible host. She immediately made me feel at home. She speaks very good English. Here family is very welcoming too.<br/><br/>The room (garden house) was great! large, comfortable, warm with a cozy bed (slept like a baby) very quiet too. There were several heating devices but I liked to play with fire and wood so I used the wooden stove / fireplace which heat up the room so much I had to open a window. With the large windows you can see nature outside. Going into the main house (boat house) for toilet, bathroom and kitchen you can see the Amstel river all around you from the large windows and beautiful ducks and swans come to the window when you take morning breakfast with the family.<br/><br/>The house (room) is 15min easy walk from the RAI train/metro/bus/tram station. From which you can get to the airport or downtown Amsterdam. Marga can also rent you a bike which is 20-30 min beautiful ride down the Amstel river to the center of Amsterdam. The house is 15min walk from the Amstel park which was one of my main reasons for choosing this place. I definitely recommend visiting it.<br/><br/>I had great time in Amsterdam, Thanks you Marga and family for being such a welcoming and mindful host :-) "
10638791,"A cozy nest, complete with wood stove that made this Alaskan feel right at home. Charming neighborhood, with its own park nearby and a river to bike along. Above all, Marga and her family are delightful, warm and welcoming hosts. Thanks so much for sharing your home!<br/>Susan DeLisa"
10654191,"Rosie did welcome us warmly for sure. Her home is near to so many museums that we could walk. There is public transportation system available all the time. From airport, it was only 25 minutes. Room was comfortable enough for a couple except that if guests have heavier luggage, they have to haul it all the way to the 3rd floor.<br/><br/>Rosie was very explicit in laying down the law of the home, expected behaviors and ‘do and don’ts. However, whenever we made a request, there was an excuse about a German guest who caused problems for her earlier.<br/><br/>1)Her ‘continental breakfast’ was an item to talk about. It included, one slice of cold bread for each and a couple of cakes (basket was cute though). And the coffee provided was the morning one she prepared for her family heated in a microwave for about 30 seconds No toaster to toast the bread. We opted out of her breakfast for the remainder of the stay.<br/><br/>2)And forgot to mention. She is big on cultural sensitivities so much so that when we asked if we can use her kitchen tap to take drinking water to the room, she pointed out that bathroom/toilet tap is good enough to get water. We got water bottles on our own.<br/><br/>3)No hair dryer in the bathroom – when asked for it, it was blamed on that German guest spoiling some electrical stuff. However, the day before we leave, she offered a hair dryer but by that time, my wife got her hair done outside.<br/><br/>4)No body wash/soap/shampoo was provided (we got it on our own).<br/><br/>And to give credit to Rosie, we had to arrive a day earlier due to some program changes and she did make the room available with no fuss. Thank you Rosie for that.<br/><br/>In the end, we managed to have a good time but we did look forward to leave that place soon as we never felt comfortable or at ease, unfortunately. I do know that my feedback might upset Rosie but I thought it is worth taking the risk for future guests and for herself to improve hosting. Thank you."
10663598,"Beautiful apartment in a fantastic location - super easy to get in to the centre, but a much more relaxed area to stay for when the hustle and bustle of tourists gets too much.<br/>Hinde was a really great host - easy to contact and very helpful when needed. I felt like she went above and beyond to ensure we were happy and comfortable for our stay in her place.<br/>Thanks Hinde and I'm sure we'll be back in Amsterdam before long!"

10697017,"Absolutely brilliant time staying in the uber cute guest house.  It was perfect for my needs, and I rented a bike.  Super convenient and great price!  Marga even did a regression therapy session with me which I highly recommend.  They even picked me up and dropped me off at the train station which was a lovely surprise!! Thank you so much!!  I will be back :)"
10711553,"Stayed with my husband at Andrea for a couple of days in October 2014. Andrea is very friendly and kind mistress, it was comfortable, though we badly speak in English, she tried to think of us for which many thanks;) the Room in which we lived very much in the style of minimalism, at the same time has everything you need (bathrobes, hair dryer, kettle, cookware), when arrived we waited on the table a bottle of wine and snacks, very cute;))the room was cool, no batteries, there is an electric heater. The TV did not understand how it works,but we are not upset, because I came to walk, have almost no in Canada Andrea is in a quiet area and in the green garden, where birds chirping in the morning, from the underground of 5 minutes. From the centre 20 min drive. Highly recommend;) Andrea, prosperity to You, good luck!;)<br/>----------<br/>Останавливались с мужем у Андреа на пару дней в октябре 2014. Андреа очень дружелюбная и добрая хозяйка, с ней было комфортно, хоть мы и плохо говорили на английском, она пыталась понять нас за что огромное спасибо;) Комната,в которой мы жили очень в стиле минимализма, в тоже время есть все необходимо (халаты, фен, чайник, кухонные принадлежности), когда при приехали нам ждали на столе бутылочка вина и легкая закуска, очень мило;))В комнате было прохладно, нет батарей, но есть электрический обогреватель.  С телевизором так и не разобрались, как он работает,но мы не расстроены, так как приехали гулять, нас почти не было в комнате.Дом Андреа находится в тихом районе и в зеленом саду, где чирикают птички по утрам, от метро 5 минут ходьбы. От центра 20 мин езды. Очень советуем;) Андреа, процветания Вам, удачи!;)"
10712245,"Ingo was friendly and welcoming. He pointed out a few things around the apt. and provided a list of info about it. Apartment location was great, easy to walk to many sites, stores, markets.  Nice building feature was the lift. There were some things about the apt. that need attention which would make the renter's experience more enjoyable (suggestions provided to owner)."

Ella ha sido amable y me recibío y dejo una guía para ver Amsterdam. una cosa negativa no tiene Wi-FI , algo incomodo cuando estas de viaje y tienes que verificar horarios de vuelos, comunicación vía skipe , wsup y redes sociales.<br/>Por lo demás , gracias Vibeke ."
10780695,"It was a real satisfaction to discover a little bit of Amsterdam and to be at Joyce's apartment. It is a real cosy home. No words to express our good feelings about Joyce and her tender reception. We arrived at her flat and she was waiting us with a hot tee, a clean and warm home, some advices about the city and a lovely breakfast box. The location was a great spot. We strongly recomend her to all airbnb fellows.<br/><br/>Best wishes Luciana and Ulisses"
10796430,"It was really nice to stay in this cute and cosy house. I liked especially the wooden stove and though i don't play the piano, it adds charm to the place. The location is calm and a bit remote, though i could easily reach the centre by skateboard! I can reccomend this place for those who prefer to stay in some unusual places!"
10802814,"Es war ein sehr angenehmer Aufenthalt in Amsterdam, in der Stadt wie in unserem wirklich liebevoll eingerichteten Zimmer, stilvoll und fein abgestimmt. Gleich nebenan liegt der Vondelpark, die Museumsinsel wie die City ist gut zu Fuss zu erreichen. Wenn man möchte, kann man auch Frühstück bestellen. Wir haben es genossen im Zimmer zu frühstücken. Petra ist eine nette, freundliche, aufgeschlossene Gastgeberin und wir können unsere Unterkunft wirklich herzlichst empfehlen.<br/>It was a very pleasant stay in Amsterdam, in the city as in our really lovingly decorated room, stylish and finely tuned. Right next door is the Vondelpark, the museum island as the city is within easy walking distance. If you want, you can also order breakfast. We enjoyed having a good breakfast in the room. Petra is a nice, friendly, open-minded hostess and we can sincerely recommend our accommodation.<br/>Angela and Felix"
10811630,"Petra e' stata un host gentilissima. A cominciare dalle indicazioni per arrivare all'appartamento dall'aeroporto di Schipol ( treno 1 fermata e tram tre fermate... Facilissimo e 20 minuti arrivi) e poi visto che  Eravamo in città prima delle 15 siamo passati a lasciare le valigie al mattino. Siamo una coppia con un bimbo di 5 anni e abbiamo alloggiato alla stanza numero 2... Favolosa! Molto pulita e tutto confortevole! Arredamenti molto raffinati! Il bagno e' esterno alla camera ma pulito e bello grande. c'era la cucina in comune con l'altra stanza, attrezzata e pulita anch'essa. Lo consiglio come sistemazione. perfetta per Amsterdam! Il tram e' vicinissimo e in 15 minuti sei in centro. Altrimenti si cammina e a 5 minuti c'è l'ingresso finale di Vondelpark e si attraversa fino al centro. Grazie di tutto Petra spero di tornare! Grazie anche del piccolo regalo per Filippo. "
10837097,"Truly enjoyed my two nights at eniths house. It was very cozy, clean, and comfortable. Even though she was away, her son was waiting for us at the house. He was super nice and even helped us carry our suitcase up the stairs! The bed was big and comfortable for two ppl, clean bathroom, and an amazing balcony! Thank you for your hospitality. Highly recommend!"
10854728,"Il nostro soggiorno presso l'appartamento di Floris è stato perfetto.<br/>Purtroppo non abbiamo avuto l'occasione di conoscerci ma ci ha dato tutte le informazioni necessarie via mail e la sua nanny Ana si è occupata del check in e check out ed è stata assolutamente gentile e accogliente.<br/>Si trova poco fuori dal centro che è raggiungibile in 4 fermate di tram.<br/>Casa pulitissima e ordinata.<br/>"
10862246,"Thanks to Jeroen and its nice room we spend a very good week-end in Amsterdam. Jereon welcome us with good advices for visit and food. We rent a bike to go and back from city center but his house is easy reachable by bus also. Thanks again Jereon and see you next time ! PS : Special distinction for the indiana jones flipper available in the room, i was return 15 years back :)"
10865151,"Sally was very welcoming, making sure we had everything we needed for the weekend. Unfortunately, we had to work the entire time and couldn't enjoy the city, so Sally didn't even start to share all her probably great tips with us. <br/>The apartment is amazing, everything was super clean and beds were comfortable. Great neighborhood as well.<br/>Thanks for everything, Sally. Will send you some nice pieces for you niece soon :)<br/>"
10865331,My stay with Rosie was pretty fast. The room was clean and warm. The location is perfect close to downtown with transportation available at 2 min walking. I totally recommend Rosie if you are going to Amsterdam.
10882137,"Vibeke is very friendly, cheerful and pleasant girl. She has the clean and cozy apartment with a patio in the guest room, which offers an interesting view of the clock tower. Apartment location is pretty comfortable. There is a deli food near the house. It takes just 15 minutes by bus to go to the city center. The house area, where Vibeke lives, is very green, quiet and pleasant. Thank you very much for your hospitality, Vibeke!"
10895567,"A great central location, and a nice little 'unique apartment' as the name suggests. However, not a lot of effort put into making it traveler friendly such as providing basic essentials like toilet paper and soap etc...so be prepared for your first activity in Amsterdam to be going to the supermarket if you stay here.<br/><br/>"
10914209,Olaf war ein sehr sehr netter Gastgeber.<br/>Die Wohnung liegt total ruhig in einem schönen Gebiet.<br/>Die Nähe zum Zentrum ist perfekt!
10917145,"Small, but cosy & beautiful room. The hosts were very sweet and accomodative of our little requests. Ironically our breakfast experience was different as compared to the other reviews we had read, nevertheless a good stay."
10937390,Marcel was a very friendly and helpful host. All communications were prompt and Marcel provided lots of information prior to our arrival. He also picked us up from the airport which was great. The apartment is a bit smaller than reflected in the pictures with not much room for luggage for 2 people. It should also be noted that it's a loft apartment above Marcel's and it does not have its own front door so security is not ideal. Our plans changed so we only stayed one night.
10945444,"We enjoyed our time at Vibeke's home very much. It's a lovely, cozy flat, placed close to the city center. Vibeke wasn't there during our stay, but she was reachable via What's App all the time. Furthermore her brother Ruben looked after us. He even picked us up with his car at the bus station late at night. I would definetely recommend this place!"
10998855,"Yvonne's place is excellent.  Comfortable,  clean, quiet, great espresso machine in the bedroom and very friendly house. I will definitely return. Mike's apartment is in a great part of town and Mike is a really great host. Loved the bed and the shower. Sink in kitchen has shaving mirror - handy!"
10999475,"Our stay in Remco's apartment was very enjoyable. It is in a cool part of town, about a 15 to 20 minute walk to the center or a very quick ride on the tram. It was nice to see a less touristy part of Amsterdam as well. Remco was very accommodating and generous, I would definitely recommend staying here."
11075644,"Nous avons eu Nanne et moi des problèmes de communication pour convenir de l'heure d'arrivée, plusieurs tentatives et démarches avecAirnb ont été nécessaires ce qui nous nous a compliqué la vie.  l'appartement est lumineux, correctement équipé et propre.  Il est très bien situé, près du Centre, dans un joli quartier.  La terrasse sur le toît est un atout majeur."
11085134,"Beautiful appartment, good vibes, clean. Very close to Vondelpark and Overtoom, pleanty of nice cafes and restaurants nearby. Two supermarkets at only 5 minutes walk.<br/>We felt like at home at Malou. <br/>She's a friendly and a reliable host, beside being a great photographer...<br/>Thank you Malou! "
11091049,"We had a lovely time at Dotti's.<br/>The house is spacious, well decorated and just right for a big family or group to hang around the house without invading each other. You never stop looking at the details of the house and the decoration.<br/>Aside from the spectacular sofa, my favourite part has to be Camino the cat. It made everything special, and we loved taking care of him. We even spotted his friends. He will cuddle you, if you know how to give him space and time. I will advice to do that specially when you arrive, he will get used to you in no time.<br/>If you are not a big fan of cats, we won't bother much either. I personally had a great time with him and already miss him dearly. <br/>The location of the house is just on point, it's close to the tram, the shops and the supermarkets and restaurants.<br/>We even look forward to come back as long as Dotti welcomes us!"
11091159,"The apartment is clean and super cozy, and is located in a really nice area just outside the city centre. With tram and bus connections two minutes away, there is no problem getting around. Roland and Monique seemed like really cool, laid back people.<br/><br/>We highly recommend this apartment!"
11094398,"Marga und ihre Familie sind wunderbare Gastgeber! Wir haben so ein herzliches Willkommen erhalten, der Ofen war bereits eingeheizt und wir haben uns sofort in das kleine Gartenhäuschen verliebt.<br/>Während unseres Aufenthaltes hat Marga auf allen Ebenen für unser Wohl gesorgt: mit Tipps, Fahrräder, Fahrdiensten, Tee auf der Ofenbank, gemütlichem Frühstück, viel Wärme und Freundlichkeit.<br/>Wir können dieses kleine Bijou von BnB wärmstens weiterempfehlen!<br/><br/>Danke Dir Marga! Wir kommen sehr gerne wieder:)<br/>Noemi&Sylwia"
11095001,"Great in every way! Lovey house apt. in quiet neighbour. Easy to access with tram and bus. <br/>"
11097444,"It was a great stay of three nights. Clean room, silent sleeping experience though right within the heart of Amsterdam.<br/>"
11123486,"The apartment is as amazing as it looks in the pictures. City centre is just 10-15 minutes ride on a bus and one time we have walked almost the entire distance, just because the neighbourhood is so lovely and beautiful; especially the windmill (ask Jeroen, and he will surely point you in the right direction:). I can definitely recommend staying at Jeroen place. "
11131266,"Casa Vrolik was the best choice for our Easter weekend. It is a wonderful house full of character, exactly as described if not better (the bed was super comfy). Toetsie was most welcoming, willing to advise and accommodate in every way. We had  a full breakfast provided on our arrival and a bottle of wine  which Toetsie kindly suggested we could enjoy on the rooftop :-) The Clooney machine was also invaluable!! <br/>We rented bikes and it only took us 15min to central Amsterdam while the tram runs frequent as well and there is a bus/tram stop really close. Rocky the cat was an added bonus :-)"
11133508,"Não conhecemos a Lídia mais o Jean foi extremamente solícito, a localização não podia ser melhor..foi tudo muito bom."
11146150,"Staying at Vibekes flat was like staying at home. ...she is a very lovely, warm, generously and powerful woman...we had 4 wonderful days in Amsterdam.....our room was very clean, big, bright, quiet and nice furnished- the hole flat is in a unique 40/ 50 th stile, we liked it very much.....on our last evening we unfortunately have not met Vibeke, to say Goodbye....we wish her always the best guests an that she is always in her good mood....we can only recommend her to all guests...Thanks, dear Vibeke"
11157990,"Marga and her husband live at a wonderful place. It was exactly what I like and what I hoped it would be. She welcomed me very warmly and there was everything I needed. Yet, through some circumstances, I couldn't enjoy the place as much as I hoped, but I won't blame Marga (too much) for that, because she had a lot of understanding and react very kind. I really recommend the place and hope a lot of people will enjoy it! Mijn tweede keer bij Marga. Maar een nachtje verbleven, maar alles was helemaal goed. Marga was weer ontzettend warm en gastvrij. Wil graag helpen en zorgen dat je een comfortabel verblijf hebt. Zeker een aanrader!"
11159146,"Geweldige verblijfplaats!!!<br/>- Midden in het centrum<br/>- Hartelijk ontvangst<br/>- Rust op de kamer<br/>- Heerlijk bed<br/>- Nette badkamer<br/>- Vlotte communicatie: zowel over aankomst en vertrek uur als over toeristenattracties of restaurantjes. Je kan hen werkelijk alles vragen en je krijgt heel snel antwoord!<br/>- Alles is aanwezig: haardroger, zeep, shampoo, handdoeken,...<br/>- Heerlijk ontbijt<br/><br/>Met andere woorden: Super verblijfplaats uitgebaat door twee super sympathieke mensen!!<br/><br/>Enige minpuntje dat ik kan noemen is misschien de steile trap. Voor ons was dit geen enkel probleem, maar wanneer je minder goed te been bent, is het wel belangrijk hiermee rekening te houden.<br/><br/>Wij komen alvast terug!! <br/>Dank je wel Matthijs en Francina!!<br/><br/>"
11159831,"Laura provided advice on how to reach the accommodation from both airport and central train station.  They made us feel very welcome on arrival, Arjan taking time to explain to us where the main attractions in the city are.  The location is fantastic, you can easily walk to most places.  The hosts provided breakfast which was delicious!  We had a great time and will certainly return when we visit Amsterdam again!"
11166052,"This is an absolute gem of a vacation experience.  Arie is a most accommodating host and the ship is so comfortable.  The location made it easy to walk everywhere we wanted to go.  The ship's deck made sitting on the canal with morning coffee or afternoon wine a true delight.  After a day of sightseeing it was such a pleasure to come home to the ship.  The refrigerator was stocked for us and the coffee was terrific.  Arie was available anytime we had a question or needed a suggestion.  He even arranged our taxi for the airport for us.<br/><br/>I honestly cannot say how much we truly enjoyed our time in Amsterdam on Arie's ship.  I would give this a zillion stars!"
11189645,Nicole and her husband were very gracious hosts. My family and I had a fantastic stay on their houseboat. The house was easy to find and centrally located. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend their home.  The apartment was perfect for 3. Beds were comfortable and the bathroom was very large for a European bathroom. It was very clean and tidy. A little on the small side. Perfect for no more than 4 people. Came equipped with everything you need. Down side... It is on the 4th floor and the stairs are very steep. Not for the short breathed. 
11206529,L'appartement était super. Nous n'avons pas eu l'occasion de rencontrer Mieke mais elle répondu à toute nos questions je recommande vivement cet appartement.
11210692,"Miriam was the perfect host; patient in waiting for me while my arrival was delayed, and welcoming once I had arrived. Some excellent tips for where to eat and drink were very handy. <br/><br/>The apartment is absolutely fantastic; very spacious and contains everything that I needed during my stay. You can cook comfortably and there is more than enough space to enjoy yourself. I can't speak highly enough of the place as a whole, I did not want to leave.<br/><br/>The local area is really cool and very relaxed, and the city centre is easily reachable should you wish. If the weather is nice, Vondelpark is a short walk away and De Hallen, with all its cool food vendors and bars, is just around the corner. There are several nice restaurants that you will stumble across if you take a walk. On Saturdays there is also a fantastic food market just around the corner. <br/><br/>Overall, this is the perfect apartment for seeing Amsterdam as it is very comfortable and within easy reach of everywhere.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"
11222617,"My husband, friends and I stayed at Marijn's beautiful apartment and had a lovely weekend away. The apartment was really clean, spacious and comfortable even with 4 adults. <br/>We met Marijn's mother who welcomed us and made sure everything was in order. She also met us upon leaving the apartment and helped us sort out a cab to the airport. <br/>The apartment is conveniently located and there are some great places to eat in the local area - The Breakfast Club served great brunch and Foodhallen had amazing street food vendors with so much choice! <br/>I would definitely recommend staying at this apartment. It's a great place to stay and Marijn (and her mother!) are lovely hosts."
11237375,"Vibeke war sehr freundlich. Unsere verfrühte Ankunft  war kein Problem.<br/>Sie half uns sehr mit typischen Touristenfragen und legte großen Wert darauf, dass wir uns wohl fühlen. <br/>Vielen Dank Vibeke für die tolle Hilfe und den Service :-) <br/>Greets to Kitties :-)"
11239101,"We had a fabulous time in Amsterdam! Karin was a super host, very helpful with pointing out areas to visit on her very useful crumpled city map (which is available for guests to use). Her house is beautiful, the room is very comfortable, and we slept like logs. The noise didn't bother us at all, in fact, we quite enjoyed hearing the sounds of the city  passing by outside.<br/>The boathouse is in a brilliant location, it's central without being in the noisy shopping and restaurant area, and has something to visit in each direction. We walked/cycled everywhere and could find our way quite easily.  It is nice having the room on ground level of the canal house so that we could come and go without disturbing Karin and her family. We fell in love with Amsterdam, and would happily stay at Karin's every time we visit again."
11285949,"Evin lokasyonu ve ev sahibinin ilgisi cok guzeldi. Hersey gorundugu ve aktarıldıgı gibiydi, tesekkurler Corina..."
11292057,"The key has broken last night before we leave and Nima has been very comprehensive. Moreover, the house was nice, the bed confortable and it's not so far from the center. "
11302657,Toetsie is amazing - she is one of the most friendly person I have a chance to meet. Everything was perfect - the room/bed/kitchen/bathroom/etc and the neighborhood was very quiet and peaceful and she was also very kind to look around for vegan food (and drinks) for me! So lovely! I was really sad to get back to London because I was feeling very comfortable there! :)
11325136,"L'accueil de Mike a été parfait et il a été présent à chaque fois que le besoin s'en est fait sentir. Appartement très calme et bien situé, literie de rêve après des journées de ballades dans la ville !<br/>"
11337921,"Super accueil ! Toujours disponible, appartement confortable et la terrasse est agréable. <br/>Aucuns soucis , le quartier est très tranquille et multiculturel. Un très bon séjour, donc je ne peux que recommander cette adresse ! <br/>Valentin "
11338252,"I seriously don't know how to start, I'm so excited that I lost all my words - we returned from Amsterdam last night only and we already miss it big time and we want to go back to this amazing houseboat tonight :) and it's all because of Joost and his amazing hospitality and the vibe you get once you walk in. I have never expected myself to be so proud of my choice in front of my friends as much but Ohhhhh gosh!! my friends just couldn't stop thanking me for my decision to stay in this houseboat ... unforgettable!!  If you go to Amsterdam you have to stay in a houseboat otherwise you will be spending your entire day just looking at houseboats and wishing you were there inside one, and if you want to stay in a houseboat it must be Joost's. That's it, no more words!!"
11338299,"We had a great time in Amsterdam thanks to Lidia & Jean-Paul. Their apartment is a nice large room (+1 bathroom + 1 kitchen, both well-equipped), separated by movable walls, which makes it cosy and bright. The area is ideal for discovering Amsterdam leisurely: quiet (very close to a large and beautiful park) and lively at the same time (close to many great restaurants). The old town is within walking distance of the apartment and you will find as well trams regularly. Lidia and Jean-Paul are caring and attentive people and very helpful (in particular at our arrival & departure, with our luggages in the steep staircase!). Thanks again for your warm welcome!  "
11343519,"Floris and Lucie's apartment is great! It is exactly as described, very clean, comfortable and well decorated. The bathroom is modern and bright. The apartment accommodates well a group of four adults. The location is really nice, in a quiet and beautiful neighborhood and very close to the Museumplein. You can reach the place easily by tram. Floris and Lucie were amazing hosts! They are very kind and were always available to give us information, before and during our stay. They also helped us a lot with flexible check in time. We did not meet Floris, but Lucie received us when we arrived and gave us tips of the neighborhood and good places to eat. We felt very welcomed, there were fresh fruits, Nespresso coffee, tea and milk for us. I definitely recommend it!!"
11362665,"The location of the apartment is great. It's situated right on a canal in the awesome Jordaan neighborhood and it's very easy to walk anywhere in Amsterdam or take the tram or bike. It was a great location for my first time in Amsterdam. Robert was very responsive and helpful. He provided us with maps and directions and it was very easy to get in contact via whatsapp. He also gave us some great honey wafers.<br/><br/>As for the place itself, it's fine, but not amazing. There is a lot of storage items stacked up in the stairs/hallway and the closet on the balcony, which isn't a very nice experience. None of the other units in the building have this. Also, it's hard to tell from the pictures but the bed is sitting behind that big white dresser in the one room (it's a studio, not a 1 bedroom as advertised. See picture 4/8). The kitchen floor needs to be re-done or painted. There's a large crack in the wall behind the bed. The towels smelled a bit. Overall, the apartment was clean though.<br/><br/>You're paying for the location of this place and the responsiveness of the hosts. The views are quite nice as well. Just don't expect to be wowed by the apartment itself. "
11371653,"Jeroen was an excellent host and a bit of a life saver! After arriving in Amsterdam in a horrible storm with all public transportation being shutdown (temporarily), Jeroen went out of his way and picked us up from the train station and gave us a lift back to his house. He was very friendly and gave us many wonderful suggestions on things to do/places to visit, as well as useful information about the busses and ferries and how to navigate. He also had bicycles we could rent, but we ended up not using them (due to the poor weather). The room itself was cozy, clean, spacious and very private. The wifi connection in the room was strong and we had no issues with connectivity or phone signal. <br/><br/>One issue we had encountered was unlocking the front door, as it requires a little bit more than simply turning a key and pushing the door open. As a result, we got locked out overnight and waited until the morning for Jeroen to let us back in (saving us yet again). However, once you know the mechanisms to open the front door it's fairly easy (it was our own mistake and ignorance that made it impossible to open the door) -- just make sure you can actually unlock the front door before you leave for the day!<br/><br/>Getting to the main hub of Amsterdam was a very easy 10 minute trip by bus during the day, but to get back in the evening you will have to take a night bus, which takes over 30 minutes to get back (but still very easy).<br/><br/>Despite the awful weather and the hiccup with the front door, we enjoyed our stay and would recommend anyone who doesn't mind a short commute to stay with Jeroen! He is a terrific host and will certainly make your stay that much more enjoyable."
11404629,"I had a great experience staying at Raul's place. It was very clean and well decorated. He was a great host and was very easy to coordinate with. There was 3 of us and there was a lot of space. He even provided us breakfast in the apartment, which definitely made us feel welcome. It was a ten minute walk away from central station and was in a quiet residential part of town. We will definitely stay here again."
11434659,"Vibeke was really fun, nice and helped us a lot in finding interesting places in town and helped us to get around. Also our room was nice and clean. I would definitely stay at her place if I visited amsterdam again!"
11463354,Sweet houseboat near the stadiums. Karin made us feel welcome immediately and the space was perfect for our family of 3. The kitchen was well equipped for the meals we cooked in the apartment and we were easily able to get into the center of the city by bicycle. 
11465821,"Fine place to stay in a nice and quiet neighbourhood in Amsterdam. You can easily take the bus (just a few min walk from B&B) to central station and within 10 min you will arrive at central station.<br/>Room is well equipped, very friendly hosts!"
11483052,"Alles war gut vorbereitet für uns: frische Betten, alles sauber,  sogar einige Lebensmittel, Getränke, Brötchen, Obst und sogar frische Blumen eingekauft und Fahrräder bereit gestellt, die wir intensiv genutzt haben! Es gab einen Plan  von der näheren Umgebung um den Supermarkt, die Kneipen und Bushaltestellen zu finden, es gab eine persönlichen Brief und eine  genaue Gebrauchsanweisung für alle technischen Fragen des HAUSBOOTS mit WLAN - perfekt vorbereitet! Es gab Stadtpläne , Infos zum Nahverkehr , einiges haben wir vorab schon per mail bekommen, damit wir das etwas versteckt liegende Boot gut finden konnten mit Hilfe von google maps. Wir fühlten uns als Gäste sehr willkommen. Gerne haben wir die Katzen versorgt, und uns ""wie zuhause gefühlt "". Es war ein wunderschöner Tag und wir haben mit Tee und Kaffee  in dem idyllischen Garten gesessen zwischen Blumen und blühenden Bäumen und Amsterdam im Frühling genossen. Ein echter Geheimtipp!!! "
11498845,"This is a very light, bright and clean apartment in a very nice, quiet neighborhood.  It's conveniently located with plenty of shops, restaurants and easy transport to the center of the city.  Well worth it. "
11547585,"Mirjam was very sweet and accommodating. She made us breakfast both mornings and allowed us to leave our bags since our flight wasn't until later in the day. She's just south of the Red Light District, her location is very ideal. We practically walked everywhere. I highly recommend staying with Mirjam!"
11572701,"This is a great place to stay. Very close to central station. Whilst the  neighbourhood is quite lively with the red district a few meters away you  can still enjoy quietness in David's place. Cosy, modern and full of small details. "
11572984,"We enjoyed staying at Vibeke very much! Vibeke is extremely friendly and helpful, always trying to help her guests, she even kindly let me use her laptop for a couple hours so I could copy photos from py phone. Several times Vibeke helped us navigate the city, adviced some good shops and itineraries. <br/>The room is very cozy, and the bed is so comfortable that we overslept an hour every day :) Room has a lot of books and useful travel guides that you can use to plan your walks.<br/><br/>I advise everyone to stay at Vibeke if you look for a room in Amsterdam!"
11625926,"Bon accueil de la part de Gerard, tous les jours il vérifiait que nous ne manquions de rien.Nous avons apprécié la chambre et son équipement , tout y était parfait :propreté, linge de toilette, machine à café et ses capsules, réfrigérateur etc, etc ...Chambre originale car située sous le toit , dans une belle maison très ancienne le long d'un canal .Pour nous qui aimons marcher tout était accessible à pied .<br/>Au coin de la rue un supermarché bien pratique pour le ravitaillement .Une bonne adresse que l'on va retenir !"
11626500,"This is the most fantastic stay in Amsterdam.<br/>My partner and I stayed here in March for 3 nights and it is such a cosy and lovely place to stay.<br/>Marloes is a lovely lady that made us feel very welcome and at home. I cant say enough great things about this place.<br/>If you are going to Amsterdam and want to be comfy, cosy and 15 minutes from the center then stay here.<br/>Everything was spotless. The bed was a dream to sleep on the shower was amazing clean and modern."
11647489," Die Wegbeschreibung war gut. Die Innenstadt sehr gut mit dem Bus erreichbar. Maike ist eine tolle Gastgeberin. Das Zimmer war außerordentlich, das Bett bequem. Uns wurde sogar die Garage für unsere 2 Motorräder angeboten. Toilette extern, aber für uns kein Problem. <br/>Caspar haben wir erst am nächsten Tag kennen gelernt, er war auch sehr nett. Rundum eine Klasse für sich. Note 2 + inkl. des Frühstückes.<br/>Jederzeit gern wieder!! <br/>Vielen Dank euch Beiden und liebe Grüße aus Hannover."
11657481,Ellen's place was awesome. I was in Amsterdam for a rowing regatta and her place was less than a 10-minute walk from the rowing club on the Amstel River. The apartment itself is very cozy and on a quiet street in a really groovy neighbourhood with lots of shops and restaurants. I would definitely stay again. Edith was a lovely host for me and my boyfriend in Amsterdam. She met us at the front door and welcomed us into her apartment. She provided a fantastic orientation to Amsterdam with maps and suggestions for where to go and what to do; everything you'd need for your first or even your fifth trip to the city. The room itself was a true Amsterdam experience. What a great view over a canal in a quiet corner. I spent quite a bit of time just looking at life go by outside our window with a coffee in my hand. I have wonderful memories of Amsterdam after staying here. 
11664753,"Vibeke is a very friendly and open-minded host! she provided us with many helpful information about the city and was even after a long day of work not tired talking to us and help us getting along in Amsterdam.<br/>Her Apartment is a simple place to stay, the bathroom is very small, the and the apartment, especially the kitchen, in a vintage style - very unusual to me and my to friends from Germany. :) the walls are very thin and you here the neighbours from outside.<br/>The terace/garden is a bit unkempt, but cozy - and we spent some really nice hohes in the Sun playing cards outside. :)<br/>The beds were a bit soiled from cat hairs, but very comfortable! And the two cats are very shy and cute. :)<br/>So we spent 4 wonderful days in Amsterdam and if you are looking for a simple and affordable place to stay at you cannot go wrong with Vibekes B&B room.<br/>Thank you Vibeke! :)<br/>Dana, Jenny and Julia from Berlin<br/>"
11717001,"We had a fantastic time at Ellen's apartment. It was extremely spacious and had everything we needed. Even nicer than it looks in the pictures! Ellen communicated everything we needed beforehand.<br/><br/>We really liked the area and could either walk into town or hire bikes from the shop at the end of the street at only 9 Euros per day. The areas you go through to reach the city centre are interesting with lots of good shops and restaurants - don't just get the tram in as you will miss these!<br/><br/>"
11722369,"If u like to stay in Airbnb just like in hotel, this is it. You can't not enter the living room, garden, kitchen, they are locked , not allow to enter, the space you can go is your own room and bath room. <br/><br/>One day, I saw the living room’s door is open, and Yvonne’s son is inside, I asked whether I can take photos of living room, he said Ok. I came back at that night, Yvonne knocked my room ,said to me it is not allow to take photos of her houses, after she left, and her husband knocked my room again and shout me, ask me to delete immediately, so I delete 2 photos that I took in living room in front of her.<br/><br/>I am tourist, I want to keep photos for memory that the place I stay in Amsterdam. That is it. Besides I took photos after I got the permission from family.<br/><br/>After they knocked my door warning me twice at night , I couldn’t  sleep all night , I think it I'd most worse experience stay in Airbnb.<br/>"
11738986,"Arjen and Laura were absolutely amazing!  We were picked up right from the airport and Arjen gave us a ride back to their bnb.  Every morning we received a perfect breakfast of fresh croissants, boiled eggs, fruit and cappuccinos.  The apartment was clean and stunning, with shampoo, soap, bottled water and more!  It was absolutely perfect!  Location is wonderful, very close to city center.  5 stars and 110% recommend! "
11789261,"Me disfrutaba mucho mi estancia en la bonita casita de Marga. Está en un ambiente familiar y preciosa con jardín y el río Amstel y a una pequeña distancia del centro de Amsterdam. Alquilé una bicicleta de Marga y pasé unos días maravillosos. Marga y Rico son muy amables y me ayudaban dando informaciones nesecarios sobre de ida y vuelta y de la ciudad etc. Siempre estaban puestos para soportar darme unas buenas vacaciones. <br/>"
11790440,"Fenno is an excellent host. Upon arrival, he provided us with all the information we needed to get around Amsterdam, as well as his personal recommendations which were very helpful. He is very kind and is always willing to help with any problem/question you have. Fenno's place is also an amazing place to stay, we loved it! It had everything we needed to feel at home. The place was very clean, organized, spacious, and colorful- it was perfect for my friends and I. Our stay in Amsterdam wouldn't have been completed without the help of Fenno. I will definitely stay here again if I ever return to Amsterdam. Thanks again, Fenno!! "
11795606,"Hein made us feel welcome and was a fountain of knowledge re seeing the best parts of Amsterdam, where to eat etc.<br/>the studio was small but certainly had all the essentials for a happy stay. An intimate space with a comfortable bed and a hot shower. Very good value. <br/>We felt safe in the area and the student ""pub"" down the road was fun and served good food.<br/>Amsterdam is a great city and we enjoyed our stay enormously.<br/>Many thanks "
11819012,Thank you to Toetsie for being a great host. Her apartment was very close to where I needed to be. It was very comfortable and easily accessible by tram from city centre. I also loved being able to borrow a bicycle! A really comfy bed and a very warm welcome awaits you. 
11820482,Excellent séjour ; appartement en parfait état ; environnement très celle et bucolique ; avons été merveilleusement reçu par la famille; Gabriel a toujours été très disponible pour nous . 
11831709,"We visited Amsterdam in July 2014 and were welcomed at Anik's home very friendly. The appartment was very nice and had a warm atmosphere, we felt like home immediately. It was also very clean and everything you need was there. We also enjoyed the little garden with some chairs to sit in the evening. And the two cats were sooo cute. <br/>There's a little supermarket next to the appartment, were you can buy the most important things. <br/>The next tram stations are only a few minutes to go and you can reach the central station in about 10 mins. <br/>There was a short written guide, which told us the most important things about wifi, garbage, emergency numbers, cats, etc. <br/>The contact with Anik was very nice and she tried to make our stay as pleasant as possible. Thanks a lot for everything you did for us.<br/>We really recommand to stay at Anik's home, you will feel like you never wanna leave Amsterdam anymore ;-) <br/>Maybe we'll come back to Amsterdam some day and meet each other. "
11833978,"The apartment was lovely, just like the pictures, and well located. We love to walk so we walked to every area and we found this manageable. The tram and bus stop is close by and the services are excellent. <br/>Joyce was very helpful and met us at the apartment for check in with tea and coffee. She gave us a bit of information on the area with maps and recommendations etc and sent further emails with tips and maps. We couldn't have asked for a better host. <br/>All towels, hair dryer, some toiletries, milk, fruit were provided for our use which is great when, like us, you only travel with hand luggage. <br/>It was a very nice experience and we would definitely stay again and recommend it to our friends. <br/><br/>Thank you very much :)"
11839241,"Second time in Amsterdam. I had a good time at Rosie's place, cozy room, good location,nice breakfast! Rosie has so many art collections from all over the world, it makes me feel like I was staying in a gallery : ) Good value for money! "
11887718,"The room was clean, cheerful, and in a quiet, upscale neighborhood that was  a five minute walk from the tram stop. Rosie, the host, was very welcoming and spent time getting to know the guests. Overall it was a great experience and I would definitely stay here again.  "
11892391,"A perfect stay -- the place was excellent and accurately described, and Matthijs & Francina made us feel welcome from the very first email. Combine these factors with a central location, windows facing a quiet back alley, and the included breakfast at a cosy café nearby, and you end up with our biggest recommandations -- we'll surely try to book here next time in Amsterdam. Lastly, make sure to book a massage with the hosts as well. An hour flew by in what felt like a few minutes."
11925911,"Bonjour,<br/>Nous avons passé un excellent séjour chez Mirjam.<br/>Sa maison est idéalement situé au coeur d'Amsterdam, très accessible par les transports en commun. Le logement est très agréable, et complètement autonome du reste de la maison. <br/>Merci Mirjam pour vos conseils très utile avant notre arrivée et pendant le séjour, de votre gentillesse et disponibilité.<br/><br/>Lors de notre prochain séjour, nous reviendrons chez vous avec le plus grand plaisir. Pour nous c'est une adresse à garder et à recommander.<br/><br/>A.V. de Paris <br/><br/>"
11935875,"Fomos muito bem recebidos pelo Mike. A casa correspondia à discrição e estava decorada de forma muito confortável e com bom gosto. O bairro era óptimo, com supermercado a menos de 5 minutos a pé e uma loja de aluguer barato de bicicletas recomendada pelo Mike, que nos permitiu ir a todo lado de forma prática e rápida. Bons acessos também aos transportes públicos. Boa ligação à internet. No geral, tudo perfeito. "
12014512,"Plus : <br/>- The loft was really lovely and cozy. <br/>- Every single interior details was very cute and well considered and designed. <br/>- A view from the loft was okay and you can glimpse a river right down side. <br/>- Kim & Daniel were very kind and welcoming, trying to give more information about Amsterdam.<br/>Minus : <br/>- A bit difficult to use public transportation, it takes around 40-50m to get to the center and you need 2-3 transfer (tram-ferry-bus.. but depending on where you go).<br/>- Check-out time was a bit early (11:00) and not very flexible.. Too hurry and rushing in the morning without the time to enjoy the holiday's morning... "
12019224,"A great apartment in a nice area near to the Centre with many options of restaurants, markets, etc around.  O lugar perfeito pra curtir Amsterdam.<br/>Perto do centro, confortavel e com tudo ao redor para uma ótima estádia."
12031684,"Vibeke was a wonderful hostess. Not only was she very friendly and had lots of advice on what I could do during my stay in Amsterdam, but she even discounted the price of my stay due to construction work being done on the house and making a bit of noise during my stay. I never would have expected such a kind gesture and I was so impressed by her hospitality. She was very open about me coming to her with questions and concerns during my stay and I really appreciated that. She offered me her bike to use to get around but I did not feel comfortable riding it just because it was a bit big for my small stature. I recommend to anyone who is able to use her bike or rent one because it would be much easier to get around that way. I walked most places which was not bad because the weather was beautiful, but it definitely did take a little while to get into town on foot. Vibeke's home was near public transportation, I was just making the choice to save money and get some exercise. Definitely a positive experience, and much cozier than a hostel, for a very decent price!"
12039575,"I, my wife and teenage son stayed in Mikko's apartment for 4 nights in May 2014 after Paris. The communication sent to us before the trip was accurate about the property and the locality. It is smack in the city centre, so shops, cafes and food are all around. Exploring the city was easy and mostly on foot, though one could use the metro and the Hop On Hop Off tourist bus. It is as advertised and listed. As Lorraine was staying on the floor above the apartment, getting any assistance was instantaneous. Lorraine and husband were very helpful; they even supplied us with a fan heater to help keep us warm during the rainy and cold Spring nights (can be cold for us from the hot climate and because the apartment is on the ground floor) if necessary. Though we have access to the garden, we didn't use it because the weather wasn't very kind to us as it rained almost every day.<br/><br/>We liked the place and would recommend for its central location and spacious for 3 adults."
12055331,"Monique was very helpful and quick to reply to emails. Kindly let us arrive a little earlier. Cozy, cute and clean apartment. Very comfortable. Good location, easy to access even with a car.  Short bus/tram ride to reach central Amsterdam. Apartment is next to Monique's, but you still had privacy and own entrance. Really enjoyed our stay here. "
12103798,"Very beautiful Dutch apartment with a Single canal view. Location is perfect, all what you need (Central station, restaurateurs, attractions) - 5-15 min walk distance from apart. Evert was a very very kind and friendly host! Highly recommend!!!!"
12105206,"Appartement très bien situé, à 5 min de la gare et à 1 min des commerces. Mais assez mal isolé.<br/>Nous avons eu un incident avec Ralf qui nous demandé de payer une caution de 500€ pour un jeu de clefs perdu... "
12141420,"Malou was an excellent host. she awaited our arrival even though we were a little bit late - walked us through everything the house had to offer including gifting us a bottle of wine :). the bed in this apt is like sleeping on a cloud and also has curtains to block out most of the sun. its a quick 10 minute walk to the tram stops & you can rent bicycles just a few blocks away. our stay was wonderful, would definitely come back! "
12171557,"The apartment was very confortable and great location. The host was exceptional being very accessible, helpful and friendly. Had a very enjoyable stay in Amsterdam."
12196355,"Heleen is a prompt communicator and while she couldn't be there to welcome us, she made sure to connect me with her friend and neighbor Birgitta who met us at the apartment with keys and a notebook with her personal suggestions on restaurants, neighborhoods and museums to visit. <br/><br/>We didn't think we'd love Amsterdam as much as we did and have to say that Heleen's flat had a lot to do with it. The description and photos are accurate but don't adequately convey what a lovely retreat it is. Located on a quiet residential street in the De Pijp yet within walking distance to great food (Albert Cuypmarket and surrounding eateries), cafes, shops (Gathershop is a lovely boutique of handcrafted clothing and accessories and just around the corner), parks, and the major museums. Do stop by Hartog's Volkoren, a bakery that specializes in whole grain breads, cakes, crackers and cookies (just an 8 minutes walk)! <br/><br/>We slept well with my husband and I in the master bedroom in the back, our teenage daughter in the bedroom facing the street and our preteen son on the sofa bed. <br/><br/>If we have a chance to visit Amsterdam again, we wouldn't hesitate to try and book Heleen's flat! <br/>"
12198628,"Our stay in B&B Vondelpark was perfect. The room is even better than the photos! Very nice, sunny and spacious. The bathroom inside the room was clean, with a blarge shower and toilet accesories. We didn't book the breakfast service, because there was a Lidl supermarket near the house and we bought some food to leave it in the fridge. <br/>The only bad point is that you can hear everything of the other room (if you have quiet neighbors it isn't a problem, but the first night they were talking loudly..). And the stairs to get to the house were very steep! :P<br/>It is only 20-30 mins from the airport by public transport, and in the same tram stop, you can take the tram directly to the city center in 10 mins. For us, it is a perfect ubication if you want calm and rest (we loved walking through Vondelpark!)<br/>Thanks for all Petra! You care to the last detail to give us a perfect stay in Amsterdam :)"
12209061,"Ingo has the most AMAZING apartment right in the center of the city. We where 6 guys and it fitted perfectly. <br/>Ingo left us a bunch of recommendations (and the ones that we checked was great!) and stuff to do, he was available at any time for our questions and was very helpful. Thanks for the wonderful experience!"
12212640,"Excellent position and one of the happening areas of Amsterdam. It was just what we were hoping for, comfortable clean and attention to detail with art, flowers, fruit and bedside candy jar. Wendie was very friendly and helpful and though we only met Hans briefly, they were both great hosts. Definitely a place to return to."
12213957,"Wat een mooie plek! Feels like home in Amsterdam!<br/>Beste Heleen, <br/>dank je wel voor twee fantastische weken in Amsterdam! Jullie zijn geweldige gastheren!<br/>Groetjes en het beste<br/>Katharina"
12214359,"First off I must tell you, this home is absolutely gorgeous and very well appointed.  It's always frustrating when you travel and you realize that you have forgotten something.  You won't have to worry about that here.  We were greeted right away by Ingio with a bottle of wine and a review of places we should go and see.  I can tell you that Ingio and Florien made sure we were comfortable!  The location is perfect and the views are beautiful.  We managed to eat locally every day, because there were so many great restaurants within minutes of the apartment. Shopping was a breeze too, with so many local shops, plus a big walking strip nearby.  Minutes from Dam Square and Rembrant square.  The atmosphere of the city here is nothing short of charming and safe.  The people are wonderful and our host Ingio, was so informative and helpful at every turn.  He even caught us a cab for our return to the airport.  If you are looking for a place that you can consider a home away from home, you'll have it here!"
12235119,"We rented kelli's & Henk's flat for one weekend. Contact via email was always friendly and everything worked out just fine. The flat is big enough for four people. And if you prefer a cosy warm and truly interesting aparment then absoluty right here.<br/>Supermarket and tramstation are just around the corner.<br/>We are defintily looking forward to our next stay in Amsterdam at kelli's and Henk's flat.<br/> We've been there twice now, which says it all really. Despite being horribly late, everything went well with the keys.   The communication was superb and instant. We don't have to say much more, except we love your place and would love to come back next year ☺ thx for everything Kelli & Henk. Many hugs Lucy & Seb"
12235265,Room as described. Corina is an awesome host. Definitely would recommend to stay at Corina's
12236450,"Great little apartment for a quick visit to Amsterdam. I was for work in Amsterdam myself but with the availability of two bikes, the central location of the apartment and Marcel's hospitality this place is great to  use for tourists.<br/><br/>Marcel gave a quick tour through the apartment, had a full map of information and things to do in Amsterdam and has as mentioned two nice bikes available to use. Definitely recommend. Great apartment and perfect location, have done everything by foot. We visited the place of Stefanie and Mathias with 4 friends for our Kingsday weekend. Everything was clean and in order, they even left us a few drinks and checked in with us after the first night. Def. Recommend."
12277553,"Lovely apartment situated in a good neighborhood with lots of amazing food spots. The place itself is super accurate and cozy, very bright at daytime. Check-in/check-out process went easy and smooth. We've enjoyed staying here! Gert's place is all comfortable and cozy with everything included. Located not so far from the city centre, like 45-50 minutes of enjoyable walking or 15-20 mins on tram or bus (prefer tram to bus, it uses green energy :) Very close to beautiful Rembrandpark and amazing Vondelpark in walking distance (be sure to visit both). Gert was very friendly to us and made our stay to all 5-stars. Recommended! "
12302330,You will feel being taken care of a big brother in a very good way. Suuuuuper clean room with insanely comfortable bed. Untouched bathroom is beyond five star hotel. Unbelievable center location. What else will stop you from booking Edwin's room? Maybe no sleepover policy. Hahah. 
12321980,"Florian's apartment was just perfect. Best location in Amsterdam, super clean and modern just like shown in the pictures. Fernando, who did the check in/out was incredibly helpful and sweet. Would definitely stay there again and recommend it to friends. "
12327155,"bed sheet were not clean but she gave us a new/clean set after we asked.<br/>"
12329385,"A great (and big!) apartment in a very interesting neighbourhood, mixed people, mixed ages,  mix of old and new architecture, lots of free space in parks and good transportation, severel good shops for the meals. And good restaurants. So perfect if you want to see more of A'dam than the city center. The 2 bicycles are very good to have just to cruise around, they took us out to corners we wouldn't have seen without!<br/>And not to forget: Elmar is a very welcomming host, who gives you a good start answering all your questions and giving introduction to his part of the city. "
12331753,"Femke's apartment is really nice and exactly as described. The living room + kitchen is really spacious and light.  We stayed there with 3 adults and 2 kids and had more than enough room. The apartment is also equipped with everything you need in case you want to cook yourself. <br/>It is just a 5 minute walk to the tram station a large supermarket and a small but cozy restaurant.<br/>If you have a car - finding a parking spot is not a problem but you have to pay for it from Monday to Saturday. <br/>When we arrived Jacko gave us a quick introduction and also showed us places to visit in Amsterdam.  <br/>After the second day it almost felt like being at home. Our son and Femke's rabbit became big friends and we had really a great time. <br/>So we can only recommend to go there too."
12333820,"Nabila was prompt in reply to texts and emails and arranged to pick us up at Schipol Airport in Amsterdam, a short ride for her home.  She provided a personal description of the area, transportation options to the center of town (20 min tram ride) and location of grocery store and restaurants within walking distance."
12340520,"Alles is prima bevallen. Erg gastvrij en de locatie is perfect; dichtbij cafeetjes en 20 min naar CS met tram. Wel 4 hoge trappen zonder lift. Ontbijt is prima; kost 10€ per 2 personen. Goede ervaring en geen reden tot klagen. De wc is op de gang en dus niet op de kamer! Kleine kamer. Ca 15min met bus vanaf station. Er was 's avonds niks gezegd over ontbijt dus ik moest 's morgens zelf op zoek gaan, waarbij ik onwetend in de privé keuken belandde en Casper in boxershort en blote buik polshoogte kwam nemen. Ontbijt was erg eenvoudig maar okay. Geen persoonlijk afscheid: bij vertrek lag er een briefje om de sleutel achter te laten."
12350480,"Staying with Rosie and Matt is a wonderful experience. They literally made me LOVE Amsterdam so much! The room is clean and neat with a lovely window. It is a great neighborhood where you are close to resturants and grocry stores within few minutes walk. Also there's a tram station one block away where you can take tram 5 & 24 to city center. <br/>I appreciate Rosie's hospitality and her great passion on accommendating guests. She just made my visit incredibly amazing by offering a warm breakfast and sharing her interesting collection at home. The odd is her husband Matt is originally from the same city where I'm living in US. We had a pleasant conversation during breakfast. <br/>Overall, great location, very awesome host. Highly recommend! "
12379106,"Our staying at Joke's place was our first experience with AIRBN, and we are glad we chose Joke. Our staying there was exactly and more than we had expected. It started with a very warm and genuine welcome, and continued with a lists of useful tips WHERE and HOW in Amsterdam. There was also a lovely welcoming note to our names on our beds! Since our primary occupation was participation at an international training we could not have done without Joke’s delicious, huge, healthy and well-arranged breakfasts. They were not only yummy & healthy but also catching food for our eyes.<br/>The place was exactly as it was presented on AIRBNB pages, and we can only describe our pleasant staying at Joke’s with the adjectives as: warm, clean, quiet, respectful, comfortable, bright, sunny, nice, good-hearted, helpful, inspiring, charming … Joke was a pleasant companion and thoughtful adviser and charismatic story-teller not only through Amsterdam, but also through the Dutch culture. Furthermore, it was much more pleasant to be learning listening to her heart-touching stories that leafing through a guidebook. She opened the door of her flat ant also her life to us. Joke is a charming, goodhearted Dutch lady with great inner beauty and many talents: not only can she prepare a delicious meal, she can also sew an original shopping bag just for you, out of umbrellas thrown into a dustbin. We therefore recommend staying at Joke’s place without any hesitation. If we ever return to Amsterdam, where to stay is not a question.<br/><br/>Anamarija Mulej & Karin Elena Sanchez from Slovenia<br/><br/>"
12399889,Fantastic!!  Could not ask for a better location or hosts. Was greeted warmly by Matthijs who helped carry luggage up the steps. Great advice from Matthijs about what to see and how to get there. Room was exactly as described. Shared bathroom was not issue. Everything was clean and comfortable. If you have time enjoy a relaxing massage while there. I had one from Francina and it was wonderful. If I ever travel back to Amsterdam I will be bath here for sure 
12434595,"Overall, 100% recommended!  Great location in a quite and posh neighbourhood of locals- about a 10 min walk to all the museums and a 30 min walk to the wilder parts of central.  If you get a chance, I would definitely recommend renting some bikes and taking a solid tour of the park.<br/><br/>The home is beautiful; be warned the steps are steep and in true netherlands style but the place, it's furnishings, and additionals (cookwear, wine glasses, etc.) were up there as one of the best I've had through AirBnB."
12450710,"Das Wochenende bei Marga und ihrer Familie war wirklich großartig. <br/>Marga ist eine tolle Gastgeberin, sympathisch, souverän, zuvorkommend und unaufdringlich. <br/>Wir hatten außerdem ein leckeres und üppiges Frühstück auf dem angrenzenden Hausboot der Familie. <br/>Das saubere Gästehaus liegt gemütlich und schön, weit genug vom Trubel entfernt, aber trotzdem noch nah genug, um schnell ins Zentrum gelangen zu können. <br/>Wir kommen auf jeden Fall wieder und empfehlen dich unbedingt weiter!!! "
12459038,"We had the greatest stay for one week in Fenno's beautiful flat! Everything was clean and perfect. It was close to the center and Fenno is a nice and lovely person. He helped us to find a perfect location to celebrate my birthday, he left us also a pack of heinekken, a great lad! The flat is a dream with a beautiful small garden, where you can sit at the evening and drink a beer! Unfortunately we've broken a bottle of Fenno, but he reacted very nice. For sure he will get a little present as sorry! A great week in Amsterdam, in a great flat and we are very happy to have met a person like Fenno! We keep in touch, cheers Stefan!"
12467648,"I had a great one night stay at Toetsie's. I met her in person and she's genuinely nice. The bedroom looked exactly like the picture. Good communication, easy checkin, quiet neighbor with short walks to two tram stops. Great location. The place was clean. She provided plenty of breakfast items that you can prepare yourself in the morning. Plenty of plates, cups, silverware in her tiny kitchenette. I did share a bathroom and toilet with the other 2 Air bnb renters, and  I had no problem with that. Overall I has a great first air bnb stay!"
12486875,"I was visiting Amsterdam during Easter weekend with my brother and his girlfriend, and decided to give airbnb a shot for the first time. I'm very glad I decided to do it, because we had an amazing experience with Ingo and his apartment. The apartment was huge, beautiful, and located right at the corner of two canals, which made for lovely views. It had every amenity we could have wanted, and more than enough room for three people. Ingo was a kind and gracious host, welcoming us with wine and cookies, and giving us all the information about the apartment and city that we needed. He was very flexible about arrival and departure times, and was always easy to get in touch with. I can't imagine having a better experience at a hotel, and would love to stay here again on future trips to Amsterdam."
12497683,"The best possible starting point for a family to explore this beautiful city: close to all the interesting sites (walking distance!) but in a quiet, urban neighbourhood that allows to savour true Amsterdam life as well. Go out during the day, enjoy the bustle of the city and relax in the stilish, uncluttered and spacious flat at night.<br/>Very friendly and forthcoming hosts, everything worked smoothly and well. <br/>We can only recommend Sanja&Adrijan as hosts and their flat as the perfect place in Amsterdam!<br/>"
12500470,"Olaf's colorful home was a great place to stay in Amsterdam! He was great about communicating with us both before and during our trip and even gave us recommendations on things to do. His neighborhood is just a 10-20 minute walk away from many attractions like Alfred Cuyp market, the Heineken Experience, and the Rijksmuseum. The rooms were clean and comfortable and the area felt very safe. There is even a rooftop terrace where we were able to eat and watch the sunset. We would highly recommend staying here to anyone who is visiting this amazing city. "
12501848,"Marga's gastvrijheid is bijzonder en uniek. Het maakte ons verblijf in haar tuinkamer helemaal af. We hebben erg genoten van de gezelligheid van de kamer, de kachel en al het groen erom heen. Het ontbijt was heerlijk en het was fijn om met de fietsen van Marga de stad in te gaan en weer 'thuis' te komen in een volledige groene omgeving. Kortom, een unieke plek zo dichtbij het centrum van Amsterdam. "
12505439,"Un mini appartement au cœur d’une maison charmante, très bien placé.<br/>La chambre était comme dans la description, néanmoins la salle de bain avait été nettoyée un peu vite et la poussière dans la chambre n’avait pas été faite.<br/>Les hôtes sont très sympas. <br/>Malgré le petit bémol je recommande ! <br/>"
12522183,Anoushka was a terrific host. The neighborhood was in a great location and offered plenty of options for dining and accessibility to other parts of Amsterdam. Anoushka has a very thorough knowledge of De Pijp as well as the rest of the city when it comes to recommendations. This was by far the best hospitality I have received from an air Bnb host and I would look to stay here again the next time I find myself in Amsterdam.
12539185,"Iris et Juul sont vraiment adorables, accueillants et disponibles.<br/>leur péniche est un havre de paix pas trop loin du centre ville, et le tram est à 5mn de marche.<br/>le voisinage du bateau est sympa et attachant.<br/>nos vélos ayant été volés a Bruxelles, Juul nous à gentiment prêté deux de leurs vélos...<br/>une très belle adresse, bien tenue par des hôtes vraiment charmants.<br/>"
12561763,"We had the best time staying at Vibekes place! She is a fantastic friendly person and she helped us with everything we wanted to know, it felt more like visiting a good friend. And the best part is not the big room, the nice furniture, the free bike or the cute cats - its THE garden. We enjoyed the sun till sunset. "
12571053,"Очень понравилось мое короткое пребывание в квартиры Matthijs & Francina. Matthijs очень гостеприимный хозяин, приятный собеседник, с юмором, перед моим приездом очень подробно объяснил, как найти квартиру, как проехать на транспорте, по приезду тоже все подробно объяснил - про завтрак, интернет и прочее. При входе в комнату была табличка, где фломастером было написано по-русски ""Добро пожаловать"" - было очень приятно!! В комнате был чайник, чай-кофе, что очень порадовало. Все было чисто, удобно,на окнах были шторы, что было важно,поскольку улица очень узкая, дома рядом. Для моего раннего отъезда Маттэс организовал завтрак (я получила его в кафе, куда все обычно ходят на завтрак, сразу, как приехала, и мы положили его в ящик-холодильник), и снес вечером мой чемодан по крутой лестнице вниз. С удовольствием еще раз остановлюсь у этих хозяев, когда снова буду в Амстердаме. Да, и здесь же хозяева держат массажный салон, релакс-массаж был просто супер."
12574822,"Me and my friend Bente stayed in Roels apartment over New Years. We truly love the area, the apartment and the Bob the cat. <br/>Roel is a very helpful and good host. He checked out places for us for New Years, stayed in contact both before, under and after our stay.<br/><br/>Amsterdam is a beautifull city!!  <br/><br/>Thanks so much for making our stay perfect, Roel:)  Another great stay in Roel's apartment! Great apartment, good location with a lot of cozy cafes and shops and Roel is a lovely guy:) We hope to revisit ! "
12613614,Beautiful clean and tidy appartment at a perfect location in the city 
12633032,"Robert's apartment was very dirty and messy when we arrived. After 5 hours driving, I had to clean the kitchen and the toilets - a dirty towel on the floor, the floor was fool of hairs. There were trash cans in the entrance.<br/>You said that your appartment is able to host 6 people but actually is not. There is actually only 2 double beds, 1 mattress on the floor. A leather sofa is not a bed, I am sorry. When we arrived we were hosted by your neighbour who treathened us whereas we were really quiet as you mentionned in your message. Honneslty, I loved Amsterdam and your apartment is well situed, but when you rent an apartment the least you can do is to arrange and clean it before people arrived in it. I hope you will be more careful for your next host."
12641061,"I stayed at Bronte's flat for two nights. The house is gorgeous, very very comfortable and I instantly felt at home there. Warm, cosy and spacious. It's close to public transport and located in a nice and safe area. Bronte sent me lots of information before my trip, and communication was quick and easy. I am in love with this home and would love to stay there again and recommend it to everyone!"
12651329,Me and my girlfriend are very satisfied and happy of the stay. It is very comfortable and it feels like home. Debby is very friendly!! She taught us the way to take the tram and how amsterdam map works. She also walked us to the tram station and let us know the good places nearby. She is very kind and helped us by taking our luggage. The place is too lovely and the toilet is so clean and neat. I must say this is the best place I've stayed so far travelling to few places. Highly recommended. A very romantic place for couples too !!
12656936,"We really enjoyed this bright, cozy space located so conveniently to tram and bus stops! In our case, we took the tram from the train station on arrival and took the bus to the airport on departure and it was very straightforward. Robert was a fine host and easy to communicate with and even gave us a gift of stroopwafels. We were here for Kings Day and this location is good for that because it's right on the edge of the craziness, so you can have your fun and then rest up. :) The only thing to note is that the place is at the very top of the building and the stairs could be a problem for someone with knee problems. Other than that, a wonderful experience!"
12663460,"Marion gave us the very best image of the Amsterdam people! She is so nice, friendly, considerate and provided us the warmest hospitality. <br/><br/>The room was just as its name: room with a heart. We felt safe and comfortable during our stay. The garden was nice. We had a private toilet and a private corridor. We could use the kitchen at our will.<br/><br/>Everything was well prepared by Marion. We did not need to rent bikes as she had them for us, for free! She had already thought of so many things at travels' view even she was so new to Airbnb by the time we visited. And I am sure that she will even take care of others in a better way from time to time. I bet everyone will have a very good experience in Amsterdam with Marion! <br/><br/>Marion人非常好！讓我們覺得阿姆斯特丹人都很NICE！她是兩個小孩的媽媽，給我們很親切的感覺，又很細心，房間的很多小東西都準備得很有心思。比如說我們拿到房間的時候桌上有準備小點心，床頭也放好了鮮花。<br/><br/>房間跟照片基本上沒有差別，環境很好很舒適。我們有房間專屬的洗手間跟走廊，落地窗打開就是小花園，空間跟陽光都很好。房間完全符合它的名字：Room with a heart.<br/><br/>Marion很細心的為訪客準備了很多東西，毛巾、雨衣、傘、旅遊資訊等，重點是還準備了自行車！阿姆斯特丹是個自行車城市，但不少住宿地方都不提供自行車，或是需要租用，但Marion為訪客免費準備了自行車，而且在我們到來的第二天，她發現了對於我們的女生來說她的自行車太高，還特地買了一台小一點的！<br/><br/>結論是，如此好的房東，肯定能讓你的阿姆斯特丹之旅安心又溫馨！"
12677717,We had an awesome stay with Toetsie! She was very kind and welcoming and the room was very comfortable. I would definitely recommend it! 
12686729,"Séjour chez Kate à Amsterdam qui s'est extrêmement bien déroulé. L'appartement est idéalement situé, beaucoup d'espace et très propre. Kate nous a bien accueilli et donnée de bons conseils sur la ville.<br/>Je recommande vivement ce logement."
12691042,"Had the best time staying with Joke. She's the perfect host: friendly, cheerful, caring and resourceful. Her apartment is very stylish, impeccably clean, and spacious while also being cosy. What can I say about the breakfast? Delicious! Having one of her wholesome smoothies at the loggia overlooking Mercatorplein is a great way to start the day. Joke is a very skilled cook, always trying something different. The best apple pie we had in Europe was hers. <br/><br/>She gave us a tour of the neighborhood, taking her time to explain everything about Amsterdam, from architecture to  local customs, as well as giving helpful tips of things to do and places to visit and eat. <br/><br/>The location is very good. Away from the crowded touristy areas but less than 20 minutes by tram from the Central Station. It's a very interesting part of Amsterdam that is often ignored by tourists, and for that very reason it is much more quiet and interesting, full of hidden treasures. Lots of bars, pretty shops, snacks, cafés, plus two supermarkets nearby.<br/><br/>The tram/bus stop is literally in front of her building. I've never been closer to public transport in any other trip and it has made all the difference. I would also suggest riding a bike around the neighborhood, then south through Rembrandtpark all the way to Vondelpark, then north through the historic center, then taking a ferry from Central Station across the river Ij then back again. For that there's a nice rent-a-bike shop just a few meters away from her place. <br/><br/>Our trip to Amsterdam was truly unforgettable and Joke played a big part in that. We hope to visit her again soon. Thanks, Joke! <br/>"
12696814,"This apartment (and the whole building!) is beautiful! It's definitely true to the pictures. We really loved the decor and comfortability. It was very spacious, very clean, and a great location. Would recommend this place to anyone!<br/><br/>As it was technically a ""private room"" it felt very separate to us and really felt like we had our own apartment. "
12714602,"Notre séjour à mes enfants et moi, fut une véritable réussite. Amsterdam est une jolie et agréable ville, où il fait bon vivre. L'ambiance y est conviviale et festive, tout en gardant de nombreux sites culturellement intéressants. Stéphanie nous a accueilli très chaleureusement dans son très beau et fonctionnel appartement, dans lequel nous avons séjourné 4 jours en étant comme à la maison. Même si nous avions choisi de réaliser tous les déplacements à pied (vive le sport !!!), les transports en communs sont à proximité. L'appartement est situé correctement à quasi égale distance des sites à visiter. Ce logement était même mieux que les photos !!!!<br/>Encore merci Stéphanie, de nous avoir permis de compléter avec bonheur notre album de souvenirs de vacances.<br/>Laurent"
12719861,"Lovely, characterful rooms in a traditional house. Toetsie is a warm and welcoming host. I very much appreciated the offers of wine and beer, though my stay was so short that I didn't have the opportunity to accept them, or to explore the bookshelves. The neighbourhood is peaceful, away from the centre, but in an interesting and culturally diverse area, with all sorts of cheap international dining options. And transport links are very easy. "
12728018,"Maaike was a great host. <br/>She was very friendly and when we need her help about to find something in amsterdam she was everytime available. Her Home was very nice just like the pictures. Even better than the Pictures:-). <br/><br/>When i come back to amsterdam, first of all i ask her to stay in her home. :-) Perfect 3 days:-) "
12740492,Vibeke was a wonderful host. The day I got there she gave me great information about what to see how to get around Amsterdam. She is easy to talk to and very nice. I felt very at home during my stay. The house is about a five minute walk to a tram station that goes to the center and it is very easy to figure out. <br/>The house has a nice set up<br/>With a nice backyard. The room had a lot of space and the bed is comfortable. If I ever go back to Amsterdam I will definitely stay here again. <br/>. 
12741829,When we first got there everything went for a smooth checkin she had a company called keybnb meet us at the apartment and let us in. The door is slightly not aligned so you must pull it toward you and then turn the key for the door to open. The apartment looks exactly like the pictures and even better! We felt just as if we were right at home. Location is a 10-15minutes away from the city and everything going on. There is the train/metro/tram right up the rode and if you continue up the rode there is a small supermarket to grab some food for the house. There is also another supermarket at the end of the other rode on the front side of the apartment. The only problem we ran into was trying to figure out the wifi as there were no paper or slip in the apartment with the wifi and password & the keybnb host had the wrong password but I contacted Nancy and we got that solved very quick! We already miss this apartment so much! Amazing place felt just like home 
12749547,"My first time with airbnb and a very good experience... <br/>The appartment was very easy to find, well located, 3 tram lines, buses, metro all walkable..<br/>We stayed in the 2 person room in the 2nd floor which was private and has a bathroom and toilet, there was no one in the 1 person room so the entire floor was ours and even when the other one was occupied, we didnt feel any difference, So you feel like having the entire floor just for you. From the entry to the appartment, there are no shared space so you dont need to cross any living room to get into your room. If you would like a bit of a privacy highly recomend this one. The breakfast was good enough with some breads to bake, eggs, cheese, jam and other topings.  Very flexible with the check in timings, was able to store our bagages on the last day.<br/><br/>About the hoste Toetsie, she is very open and very friendly on the first day, she came down to greet us small chit chat and gave some info about the appartment and the surroundings. The next we saw her was on the day we left. I had a small injury and she helped me with the medicines and bandaids, so nice of her to do it. <br/><br/>The next time if I go, I would stay here for sure."
12753064,"Hi,<br/>The apartment is great!<br/>Very spacious and fully equipped.<br/>Location is also a huge advantage, since the supermarket is minutes away by foot. <br/>Even walking to the city center is easy enough.<br/>Thanks for the great stay in Amsterdam."
12763414,"This was one of the most comfortable stays of my whole 3 week trip. Marijke was incredibly welcoming and flexible with our last minute traveling plans. She let us check-in early and check-out late, which was very helpful for us. The room is bright and sunny and just what we needed. The flat is centrally located in a very nice area, away from the busy part of Amsterdam but close enough to hop on a tram and get into the city easily. You can tell Marijke loves hosting traveller's and I really appreciated the hospitality. "
12788182,"We spent seven days at Richards apartment and it was amazing the apartment was just right for us as a place of eating and sleeping, the apartment was clean and very bright, we had everything we needed for our break and if we needed to contact Richard he would be easy to get a hold of, he was a great host and I would recommend anyone to stay at the apartment it has great location as it's close to rembrandtplein and walking distance to other great areas, highly recommend <br/>thank you very much <br/>Lucy, Sophie & Leona x"
12810868,A lovely room for a solo traveler or couple with a very friendly and accomodating host.
12843891,"Merci à Floris et à sa famille de nous avoir permis de séjourner dans leur bel appartement, très proche du centre ville à vélo, agréablement décoré et très confortable.<br/>Nous avons passé un merveilleux séjour, dans cette belle et douce ville d'Amsterdam, sur laquelle le soleil n'a cessé de briller ! Nous ne pouvons que recommander cette location. Et remercier Ana qui nous a si gentiment accueilli et facilité notre départ. "
12851227,"This was our first airbnb experience. My husband and I really enjoyed our stay in Edith's apartment for 3 nights. She gave clear instructions on how to get to her apartment from the airport. Edith was there to greet us upon our arrival. It was pouring rain when we arrived and Edith was kind enough to lend us an umbrella. She even made us coffee and provided us with a map (which was very helpful). The room was exactly as advertised. It was clean and cozy and the bed was extremely comfortable. We had an issue with the electrical outlets on our last night due to our travel adapter breaking inside the outlet. Edith was there to assist us right away after sending her a text. We highly recommend staying with Edith. Note that if you are travelling with a large luggage, beware of the steep, narrow stairs to the room which was on the top floor. We had backpacks and could not image how anyone could carry a large luggage up those stairs."
12855854,"Fenno was a great host. We met up for a chat when I was coming and leaving. He asked if I had any questions, answered them all, and then helped to get to a football by hunting down and buying the tickets for me. <br/>His apartment isn't too bad either. I loved the location. It felt a real neighbour where real people live but still close enough to walk to everywhere I wanted to go. <br/>However, the bus and tram stop aren't far away if you needed them. Supermarkets bakeries etc are all close enough too.<br/>Finally, there was comfortable, the shower hot and then Internet great. I was ready to move in and stay."
12861828,Wat een geweldige ontvangst na een dag hard werken! Simone je bent een gastvrouw in de ware zin van het woord! Ik kwam echt doodmoe bij je binnen maar met een glas wijn en samen even buiten in het zonnetje zitten maakte dat ik meteen een heel welkom gevoel kreeg! Jouw kleine hondenvriendjes waren gezellig rondom ons aan het snuffelen en ook zij hebben mij vriendelijk bejegend. Nogmaals dank voor je gastvrijheid en dat heerlijke bed kom ik in de toekomst zeker nog eens beslapen. Ik wens je veel succes met je gezellige 'typical dutch' plekje in mooi Amsterdam.
12879104,"Imóvel esplêndido! Muito bem localizado, limpo, amplo e confortável, exatamente como mostram as fotos. <br/>A localização é também excelente, permitindo que muitos os passeios sejam feitos a pé.<br/>O David é um ótimo anfitrião, muito simpático e atencioso, sempre deixando um ótimo café da manhã na porta do quarto todas as manhãs.<br/>Recomendo a todos que queiram ter uma ótima experiência em Amsterdã.<br/>---<br/>Splendid property!

12912905,"Marga is a really nice host. She picked me up at the airport early in the morning for a reasonable price. She also preheated my room so when I came, the room was really warm. The room is spacious and the everthing's great. Marga and the whole family is very helpful. Thanks for everything and taking care of my injured finger. "
12952547,"Very nice place and smashimg hospitality , Pretty and quiet wooden house well equipped and with all confort , trams and train nearby for a quick entrance incitycentrum or museums area. Thanks Gina arrivederci"
12954019,I went with my wife four nights and we spent a wonderful esperience! David is a very gentle and available person! The room is perfect! And the breakfast is very good and made with love! Beautiful location! Thanks David for everything! 
12955823,"My experience at Toetsie's was very positive! Her place is large, bright, and clean, and Toetsie herself is a friendly and attentive host who made my stay very comfortable. She helped orient me in her interesting neighbourhood and in the city at large. Unexpectedly, it actually felt better to be a little away from the centre of town, all of which is easily accessible by public transit. "
12956633,"Thank Vibeke for this enjoyable journey.<br/>Vibeke is very warmhearted and we immediatelly feel comfortable.<br/>She advise us some really interesting tours.<br/>Her home is full-equiped, she let us use everything we need.<br/>The neibourghood was consistent with the description and quiet.

Elle nous a conseillé quelques visites très intéressantes.<br/>L'appartement est très bien équipé et Vibeke nous laisse tout à disposition.<br/>Le quartier était conforme à la description et calme. Les commerces sont très proches."
12986962,"We loved this fantastic bright apartment with its large panarama windows in two directions. Wonderful to stay above the tree tops in this old canal house. The bus stop was just across the street and the tram around the corner, very convenient. The area around Lijnbaansgracht with all canals and beautiful houses is just wonderful. Jordaan is certainly the nicest part of Amsterdam with lots of small shops and cosy restaurants.<br/>Robert was very helpful and considerate. He provided lots of maps and guidebooks and gave us many useful tips about what to do and where to go. <br/>Thank you Robert for 5 perfect days in Amsterdam!<br/>Anita and Katarina"
12997319,"I stayed here with my partner for three nights in May. Daniella gave us clear instructions on how to get to her apartment from the airport, and it was very simple to do so (It took around 20 mins in total). The bus truly does stop right outside!<br/><br/>She greeted us on arrival and took us to the room which was great - clean, comfortable and with a very handy coffee machine. The shared bathroom and toilet are also very clean and well looked after. She advised us on how to get to the centre and gave us some useful information to read. The room is about a 15 minute tram journey to Dam square which was near most areas we wanted to explore (The Jordan District, Anne Frank Museum, Vondelpark etc). <br/><br/>All in all, a great base from which to explore Amsterdam."
13001767,Corina was an excellent host. She was very friendly and gave us great tips on places to go. The room was comfortable and the outdoor garden was gorgeous! 
13008729,"Anke and Roberts place was perfect. Great location, quiet neighborhood. The building the apartment is in is clean and quiet. <br/>Robert met us there and was super helpful. He pointed out plenty of things to do and places to eat.<br/>We would definitely stay there again next time we are in Amsterdam.  "
13031854,"It was very nice stay :) Vibeke is a very friendly person that makes you feel like home. The flat is cozy and the bed extremely comfortable. Thank you :D <br/>"
13049993,"Rutger is a great host, easy to communicate with him. The apartment is very nice, it's quite spacious and cozy. The neighborhood is great, very close to both Westerpark and Centraal Station, easy to reach by public transport. Westerpark is highly recommended (provided the weather is nice) - there's more to Amsterdam than just canals. Robert is a great host! He was very welcoming, and also flexible with check-in/out times. The apartment is very nice with a wonderful balcony! The neighborhood is great with lost of cafes/bars/supermarket near by and very easily accessible by tram. I would certainly like to stay at Robert's place again!"
13056080,"Malou is a delightful, friendly and unfussy host. She met us and showed us around the flat, texted us the next morning to make sure we were OK and was really lovely to deal with. The flat is fantastic and so comfortable to stay in. A fabulous kitchen with everything you could need, a lovely garden, really nice living/dining room area and the most comfortable bed you could possibly hope for! Great area of Amsterdam - peaceful and within really easy reach of the centre. Terrific place, lovely host - couldn't ask for more! Thank you. "
13149579,"Joris was great and the home was incredible!  Really beautiful and the location was absolutely perfect.  Close to all sorts of things, we couldn't have been happier.  "
13176217,the perfect host.she is do everything to feel comfortable and its done!If i come back to amsterdam i ll be stay at vibeke.
13265647,"It was my first airbnb experince and it was great! Joke wonderful women, she is very kind, responsive, open and helpful lady. She is good in cooking. And we always had tasty and healthy breakfasts! When we came to the Joke's house there were candles everywhere and played nice music. We felt very cosy and comfortable in Joke's house. One of my friend had birthday party so Joke prepared cake! It was so nice! Joke is good guide. She know everything about Amsterdam and she will tell you what and how. <br/>House is really cosy. It's near the train station. You can go to the centre by train - it's 10 minutes. But we went by foot - it's something about 25 minutes, but it also good. <br/>Thank you so much, Joke! Our stay in Amsterdam was perfect becouse of you! <br/>I duplicate this review in Russian.<br/><br/>Кто захочет остановиться в Амстердаме - не раздумывайте, останавливайтесь у Йоко! Она потрясающая хозяйка, очень гостеприимная, много нам помогала. Квартира очень милая и уютная, добраться до нее очень легко, тем более, что Йоко дает подробнейшие инструкции. Она настолько заботлива, что даже приготовила пирог в день рождения моей подруги, чем очень растрогала нас. Ко всему подходит с душой, когда приехали, по всему дому были расставлены свечи, играла музыка, было много цветов, накормила нас, напоила чаем, хотя это не было оговорено. Рассказала, куда сходить в Амстердаме, снабдила картами. В общем, все продумала до мелочей, больше чем она сделала, просто было сделать невозможно. Нам очень понравилось у нее, советую всем!"
13283182,I loved the location and the views of the apartment! Clean and beautifully decorated 
13284149,"Nice hosts, good location, nice apartment. Would definitely recommend it to others! Ester is a nice and friendly host who made us feel very welcome. The apartment is nice and cosy, clean, suited me and my boyfriend very well. A nice touch is the bathtub and fresh flowers/fruit/drinks. Would recommend it to others! We have stayed in quite a few airbnb homes over the years and what we really like about that (compared to a hotel) is the personal contact (and everything that comes with that) you usually get with the host.<br/>Jorrits place is run by a company called ""iambnb"" wich means that you are not in contact with the owner of the place at all. Also, the ""person"" you communicate with on airbnb, is not the same person who will check you in. <br/>We had some communication issues regarding our check-in. Also, before our arrival we asked specifically about hairdryer and iron and we were told there is neither, so we bought new ones at the airport. The first thing we see when we arrive at the apartment is an iron and a hairdryer...<br/>These things probably wouldnt happen if it was a private person, renting out their own home.<br/>The ""host"" kept going on about they have 400ppl checking in over the city, wich we coulndt care less about.<br/>The apartment is quite nice though. Cosy and nice view over the roof tops. Especially at sunset. Close to everything.<br/>However, the bathtub is full of off putting stains and the drain full of hair.<br/>The toilet is extremely noisy when flushed."
13290581,"We really enjoyed this apartment. The neighborhood is great as well. Tons of great bars, restaurants, and cafes, and very near the museums and park. This place had the most useful items I have found so far in an airbnb.. all kitchen items one would need, washer and dryer etc. Thank you for making us feel so at home here and for all the great tips! The apartment was great! The bed is very comfortable. There's A/C in the bedroom,  not super common. The location is great, lots of great food nearby and a fun atmosphere. I'd definitely recommend this spot. Additionally, when we had an overbooked flight and couldn't arrive until a day late (super frustrating) Annabel was very understanding and made sure someone could meet us to let us in, even though she was out of town."
13316167,"Maria was very warm and helpful on our trip to Amsterdam. Her place is very near a street full of quirky cool things (as well as lots of cafes!) and navigation wise it is also very easy to head to the train station as well as Dam Square. A sumptuous breakfast was provided for the mornings we were there and we were definitely impressed! Even on our last night, where we had to leave very early in the morning, she prepared a small tray of breakfast foods for us to have before we left. Very hospitable and charming, would highly recommend to anyone looking for a very worthwhile stay in Amsterdam."
13320112,This lovely space far exceeded my expectations. It was absolutely charming and in an amazingly charming area right on the canal. We could walk to most of the local sights. Margo's special touches such as the lovely wine and breakfast made this the most memorable stay. You will be quite fortunate if you can reserve this place! 
13335305,"Ingo has a fantastic flat and did everything he could to facilitate us having a wonderful weekend, which we did. We will return!"
13352049,"The place is perfect to say the least. Great location, great hosts made for a great experience. It's location is perfect short walking distance to downtown museums and some great food stops.  Our hosts were very helpful even picked us up at the airport and offered a boat ride through the canals, we could not ask for anything better.  The space is perfect plenty of room and very nice.  We cannot wait to  go back !! Thank you again for the wonderful experience.  "
13373658,Thanks a lot to Bronte for her very nice flat. We were very happy to spend two days here. The apartment is clean and comfortable. We apreciate  a lot the balcony with the view. Good place if you want to come in amsterdam.
13393963,"Vibeke was so nice and friendly. Her flat is tiny but full-equipped. There is a garden just outside the room, really green and bright.<br/>Vibeke was helpful to teach us all the things we need to know. And we enjoyed our stay in Amsterdam!"
13397939,"Pim was a friendly and helpful host, ready to assist with any upcoming difficulties upfront. We didn't meet Pim in person, but he made our check-in quite easy and provided us with a good place to stay. The apartment is well located near the city center and has a nice little garden.<br/><br/>For two people his apartment would be quite cosy, but since we we're traveling with four people it was a bit cramped. It is a two-room flat, so you should take that into consideration when planning your stay.<br/><br/>All in all we had a good time, although the price-performance ratio was a bit off."
13425635,"The apt has a great location, only few mins walk from central station. The room is cozy, clean and with all the facility we need, just like a five star hotel. And the best thing is David prepared big breakfast for us  which always make us a good start in a day in Amsterdam. "
13440832,"Overall, it was a wonderful experience to stay with Maria in Amsterdam. She immediately made us feel welcome into her home and provided us great advice on places to eat and things to do. The location was wonderful with restaurants close by and walking/biking distance from the major tourist attractions in Amsterdam. Maria provided breakfast every morning which was a great added bonus! Additionally, her apartment was very clean and spacious. One complaint is that she offers many add-ons for an extra fee. I stayed the weekend with one of my girlfriends. One of the reasons we wanted to stay at Maria’s is that we each could have our own room and bed. At the end of the stay Maria informed us that we owed an extra 15 euros for the extra bed set. Maria does list all of the extra fees on a sheet with the other rules of the apartment. However, the fee caught us off guard because there were two of us and we did not think that would count as an extra bed set. Other than the extra surprise fee at the end, it was a wonderful experience and I would highly recommend her apartment. "
13493506,"Gina's place was PERFECT. Honestly the best Airbnb I've stayed at yet.  Only a short 12 eruo Uber to the city core it was nice to have tons of space and an immaculate place to sleep. <br/><br/>She was the perfect host - greeting us as we arrived and provided coffee/tea, fruit and even a bottle of wine for our arrival. <br/><br/>I would HIGHLY recommend and will definitely stay here again if I ever find myself in Amsterdam again! "
13497541,"Nicole made us feel extremely welcome in her home, she left some prosecco and snacks along with her laptop speakers and spotify account which we were all very grateful for. She has a beautiful home with exquisite taste and we felt very at home there. The boat is exactly as described, if not better, it's hard to capture the uniqueness of the boat in pictures. The neighbourhood is lovely. We have always loved De Pjipe. We will definitely be requesting another trip next year. "
13498927,"Accueil très agréable et sympathique.<br/>Logement idéalement située, à 10 min de la gare, en plein centre d'Amsterdam et dans une petite ruelle.<br/>Chambre confortable, fonctionnelle et propre. Les serviettes et peignoirs à disposition, oreillers moelleux.<br/>Super petit déjeuner pris dans une boutique à 5 min à pied, dans une ambiance douce et calme.<br/>En résumé, un super week-end prolongé."
13524799,"Modern flat in a good area close to all the attractions. It's a quiet street with friendly locals. The only disappointing thing was the housekeeping. With an additional cleaning fee added to the rate, you expect a pristine flat but it wasn't up to the mark.  If they can sort that out it would be a great flat to stay in. "
13534189,"Such a fantastic stay. Location is brilliant, everyone make us feel very welcome and the place itself it a completely separate basement complete with it's own living area and bathroom. Still very light and airy. Breakfast was amazing too! "
13572508,"Francina and Matthijs were in prompt contact beforehand via email. Francina welcomed us warmly as per arranged time and was helpful with any questions posed. The room was simple but clean and comfortable. Bathroom shared but clean, spacious, great shower! Breakfast at cafe was superb!! Located on fairly quiet street in the centre of everything.  Noise mainly from airplanes and late evening partying in surrounding streets but we would not hesitate to stay again."
13573213,I can only agree on all the other positive feedbacks. The apartment was great - the neighborhood was great and the hosts were great. We really had a great time with our kids in Amsterdam
13575457,"The houseboat is large and very comfortable. We were much further from the city center than we thought. We had to walk 10-15 min to get to the tram and then 20 minutes by tram to the city. There were no restaurants or markets nearby. Again it would have been a 10-15 min walk to get food. We would have appreciated knowing this before we arrived, at night, with no supplies. The other issue was that the heat was impossible to figure out.It was cold and rainy while we were there. A list with directions on how to use the heat would have been helpful. And lastly, there is a door in the kitchen that opens directly to the water below. No deck. It was dark and we could have fallen in the canal! Not good if you have children. May we suggest a note on the door warning the guests not to go out that door! Once we figured out how to get in to town and how to warm the place up, we enjoyed our stay. The houseboat itself is very clean and attractive."
13585460,Christopher is very attentive and welcoming. He always made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed during our stay. His home is very clean and comfortable. The surrounding neighbourhood is also lovely. My partner and I enjoyed our stay very much.
13600514,"Super lovely flat in a fantastic location –– Within walking distance to everywhere in Amsterdam! Hein is a really lovely host, incredibly helpful, charming, and super accommodating to our early check in!<br/><br/>Would definitely recommend this flat to anybody who is looking for a convenient, unique and charming ""landing pad"" to exploring amsterdam!"
13603236,"Just like in the photos! Comfortable bed, great neighborhood! Bike rental just around the corner, a delicious chocolate shop and bakery cafe on the same block. Short walk from the park and several great restaurants! A nice, quite neighborhood! "
13631652,"Mirjam et Didi sont des gens vraiment charmants, qui nous ont accueilli avec beaucoup de gentillesse. Leurs conseils nous ont permis de nous retrouver facilement dans Amsterdam et d'avoir les bonnes adresses. L'appartement est vraiment agréable et à 10 minutes à pied du centre ville. Nous avons passé un agréable séjour et je conseil cet endroit sans hésiter. Merci encore à mirjam et didi."
13639426,"Rosie and her husband were wonderful hosts! They are very knowledgeable about Amsterdam and provided lots of helpful recommendations for sightseeing and dining. The room is spacious and quite comfortable with very easy access to tram lines. Also,a nice breakfast and enjoyable conversation were provided each morning. Thanks so much for helping make my visit to Amsterdam a great experience!"
13647416,"Beautiful quiet neighborhood, 30 min walk to the central station <br/>Vincent is super interesting, kind person<br/>The apartment is big, the room is decorated India/Balinese style, which is super cool,very comfortable bed<br/>"
13662169,"We were a group of 5 friends who had such a lovely time on the houseboat. The living space stood out in particular: it's very spacious, beautifully decorated and had everything that we needed.  It was a great feeling to be on the canal and, as we were very fortunate with the weather, we spent a lot of time on the waterside terrace. The area itself is nice and quiet, with plenty of amenities in the vicinity; and the hosts were always very helpful - from when I first booked the houseboat to departure. I would definitely consider staying at the houseboat again if visiting Amsterdam!<br/>"
13663473,"We stayed in Toetsie's place for 3 nights and it was unforgettable. Her house was so homey and cozy. We slept in her double room and the room was so tidy and clean. She also put some lavender under our pillows, which was thoughtful and sweet. Her kitchen was very practical and it had everything you needed for cooking. We basically cooked at least once a day during our stay. Furthermore, It only took 20 mins for us to get from the city centre to her house, this made our trip a lot handier. During our stay, we had a little accident and Toetsie did everything to help us and we really appreciated it. Thank you so much!<br/><br/>Most importantly Toetsie was such a welcoming and friendly host- you can talk to her about anything. We literally felt like we were going home everyday. With the accompany of Roky, it made our visit in Amsterdam to be our most memorable trip and we will definitely come back next time if we have a chance. Toesie, thank you for everything!"
13667468,"Andrea just started with her airb&b and she was a<br/>perfect host! She let us in with a big smile and we enjoyed eating  some dinner with her on the first evening. The room was big and beautiful too. We had a great time!"
13670256,"We had a fantastic time!  The flat is beautiful and was very comfortable for our family of 4.  The rooftop deck was a great place to relax in the evenings and we really enjoyed the short walk to the Westergasfabriek to watch World Cup football with enthusiastic Dutch fans.<br/>While we are regular visitors to The Netherlands, this house is a great location if you are visiting Amsterdam for the first time: there is an organic foods store a couple of doors away, 2 supermarkets within 5 minutes walk and several places to grab a quick bite.  And all the bus lines to tourist attractions are one block or less away."
13673682,"You wont  regret a single euro spent in this incredible house! Worth it! Great location, near everything in Amsterdam. The host is just as great as the apartment. Helpful and very kind. Will definetly come back. Thanks!!!"
13679493,"The host, David, was very friendly and helpful. We checked in earlier than expected but he allowed us to place our luggage in the room and return after housekeeping. He called us a cab to the airport at the end of our stay. And checked in to make sure everything was OK throughout our visit. The room was as described...great canal view. Private bathroom. Very clean with all the necessary amenities. Breakfast each morning delivered to door."
13688374,Loved our stay at Wendy's place. It's exactly how she describes it to be and we got to meet sweet Ginger the day before we left! Wendy is very warm and gracious host. Would book her place again the next time we visit Amsterdam
13692479,"Our stay in Amsterdam was unforgettable. The room is nice and clean with a lot of charm! It only takes 10 minutes by bike to be in the middle of the center! You also can walk or take the metro. Rob, Fang and the kids are great hosts and are more than willing to help you out with anything to make your trip most enjoyable! We highly recommend them and are happy to come back sometime!"
13707570,"This is really a cosy flat in Amsterdam and the pictures match the reality! My friends and I enjoyed the rooms and their positive energy a lot. In the one bedroom, there is really pretty light especially in the mornings, which gave the room a good feel together with the high-grown plants, which you can also see on the pictures. <br/>The hammock in the livingroom was another favourite! Location-wise the flat is situated in a well-connected neighbourhood, a little bit outside the centre, but still easily reachable with the tram and through the Vondelpark, if you hire a bike, as we did. <br/>The contact with Jordis worked very well, although I did not meet her myself, everything worked out very fine and we found a lovely welcome-note, when we arrived. So, thank you very much for the nice stay, Jordis!"
13713319,"Great place in a great location. Perfect for families though not for people with mobility issues as the stairs are very steep. The house was very clean, had big windows, and a fully functional kitchen. We would want to stay there again if we return. "
13726028,very nice place hope to come back soon 
13742521,"Location, location, location!  This room was fantastic!  It is in a most excellent location and has a fabulous host.  I stayed for three nights.  A full wall of windows overlooks a busy canal scene from the second floor.  The view point allows you to see the busy goings on in constructive anonymity.   The room is super clean and very well cared for.    The linens were exceptional and the shower was hot.  Everything you will need has been provided - from a hair dryer, to an electric tea kettle to electric converters.  David was very kind and available when you need him.  All one needs to do is email him - and you will quickly receive a response.  The walk from the train station is easy (David provides excellent directions).  The trains are super efficient at low cost.  I traveled to and from the airport and Rotterdam.  I enjoyed walking Amsterdam - thanks to the directions offered by my IPhone.  Breakfasts in Amsterdam are incredible.  My two favorite spots (Omelegg and Pancakes) are on your walk in from the central train station.  Thank you David for an excellent holiday!"
13751489,"Daniel & Viola’s apartment is modern cosy and has everything you need to enjoy an authentic stay in Amsterdam. It is a spacious, clean and well decorated flat with fantastic views of the canals which are situated at their doorstep. <br/><br/>The apartment is located opposite the number 3 tram line which makes travelling around extremely easy. It is also a short walk (5-10 mins) from the Haarlemmerplein station which gives even more access to the city and a night bus service stops at this station. There is also a supermarket close by as well as a fantastic bakery (Bakkerij Mediterranean) located at the top of Haarlemmerdijk Street where we picked up some wonderful croissants. This street is filled with boutique shops, restaurants and café’s and before you know it you will be lost in Amsterdam’s winding streets and canals.<br/><br/>The Neighbourhood is quiet and tranquil and during our 5 nights stay we has zero problems. We only wish we could have stayed longer!<br/><br/>If you’re going to visit Amsterdam we would highly recommend staying in Daniel and Viola’s flat. They were brilliant hosts that made us feel welcome and looked after.<br/><br/>Gráinne & Ronan"
13753654,"We had a wonderful experience with Marcel's apartment and airbnb.  Marcel picked us up from the airport and welcomed us to his quaint little apartment with large roof top Terrace.  He had the fridge stocked with wine, beer and coke.  After a long journey we were able to put our feet up and sit on the terrace and have a drink.  The bed was very comfortable and the bikes were the best!   Had three glorious days biking Amsterdam!   Thank you Marcel.  You were a gracious host.  We would highly recommend your place!!!!  "
13756994,"Had a nice stay at Diewerts place. The houseboat is close to Jordaan and an easy 10 minute bus ride into the city centre. Didn't meet Diewert himself but his wife took care of us when we arrived. Room was clean but  very small and felt more like a standard hotel room compared to the unique houseboat experience we were expecting. The houseboat is situated on a small canal facing a huge brick wall, was a real let down for the price we paid. <br/>A tick off the list but not what we were expecting <br/>"
13770301,"wow!! she was perfect!!<br/>and the room was cozy~<br/>at night..it was little bit cold but she gave us enough blankets so..it wasn't  problem at all..<br/>She told me a lot of information which helps me to go to hot spots easily~<br/>Oh! there is cute dog, Rosa~~!^^<br/>and THE BREAKFAST  WAS AWESOME!!<br/>Even my sister woke up early in the morning coz of breakfast..(she never wakes up in the morning because she loves to sleep..)<br/>Thanks Luchiena!!"
13816567,"Jeroen' s home is as described on airbnb catalogue and is provided with what you need to prepare breakfast. Not far from city center, just a 15mn ride by bus which runs night & day.<br/>Jeroen is a real ambassador of Amsterdam-Noord, gives you a lot of advice about what to do and where to go.<br/>We recommend his flat and for sure, if we 're back in Amsterdam we'll drop there. <br/>As he says it's ""the place to be"""
13860058,"This flat is lovely ! I spent 4 days there with two fiends. The flat is 10 minutes away buy bus. We didn't meet the owners but we met the neighbors, really nice people :) I recommend this flat !"
13862160,"Great experience. I came here for work, most of my colleagues stayed in cheap hotels nearby, and my experience was far better.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>+ The hosts (Rosie and Mathew) are very friendly and helpful.<br/>+ The room is small but nice and clean. Good bed - firm mattress.<br/>+ Breakfast is good.<br/>+ Tea/Coffee is always available, sometimes wine too.<br/>+ Fast internet - youtube was working without a problem.<br/>+ Price is very reasonable - can't beat it in Amsterdam<br/>+ Very quiet neighborhood, 2 minutes walk to the tram stop.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Not the most central location. You either need to walk 20 minutes or take a tram to get to the center.<br/>- Bathroom is shared with the other room.<br/><br/> "
13880478,"Great central location, spacious modern room and essential air-conditioning to deal with the unexpected heat of Amsterdam. Wont hesitate to use this room again.<br/><br/><br/>"
13920888,"We stayed Simona more than a week. We are very pleased with the hospitaliti. Every morning she cooked breakfast, it was very pleasant. It should be noted that the house is very clean and tidy. From the center of Amsterdam you can get home by metro. Thank you again, Simona"
13921418,"Superbe petit studio avec tout le nécessaire !<br/>L'appartement est bien situé et j'y retournerai avec plaisir.<br/>Merci !"
13923972,"The boat itself is huge and the actual living area is very spacious. 3 single beds and one double. massive front room, top deck area. Very warm inside (we were worried about it being cold situated on the river), clean and tidy, only a 15 min taxi ride to the city centre, 20 min to airport, shops walking distance, beautiful views of Amstel River, working amenities. The boat is old and you could feel the history of it inside! <br/><br/>The only thing I would say is the toilet is a bit hard to use! Involves a lot of pumping and releasing the lever at the right time for it to flush! Other than that, everything was great!<br/><br/>Would recommend to any small groups of friends or couples. "
13945263,"We had a wonderful 5 nights in this house! Highly recommended for 2 couples or a family, very nice people and a warm welcome. Tamara and Kees make sure we'll know everything about Amsterdam, they left us their bikes and the map of the city with all the information we need. The house is just a few minutes from the park and some good restaurants. One of the best things in the house is the garden, it's perfect for relaxing after spending time at the city. Thank you Tamara, Kees and the girls. Hope to see you again.<br/>"
13947149,"Wir haben die Gastfreundschaft von Joke Jaspers vier Tage lang genossen. Die Unterkunft liegt 15 Minuten vom Zentrum entfernt, eine Haltestelle für Bus und Tram ist direkt vor der Tür.Das Zimmer ist sehr ruhig . Alles war gepfelgt und sauber. Wir wuden jeden Morgen mit einem wunderbaren Frühstück verwöhnt. Joke ist eine zuvorkommende Gastbeberin, die sich Zeit nimmt zum Klönen und gute Sightseeingtipps gibt.wir kommen gerne wieder."
13947528,We enjoyed our stay in Jeroen's apartment. The room was spacious enough for the two of us. We especially enjoyed playing the Indiana Jones pinball machine that was in the room. Jeroen gave us advice about things to do nearby. He also gave us dishes when we requested them for some food that we had brought with us. There is a shopping mall close to his house where you can buy Dutch cheese and Belgian beer for good prices. We recommend this apartment to other travelers. 
13949664,"The apartment is gorgeous, and as you see in the photos. Clean and very well decorated. The terrace is a highlight! Frank's communication was prompt, and very helpful. Frank was also very accommodating in allowing us to drop off our bags early and then pick them up later at check out to get the most out of the city. <br/><br/>The location is even more perfect than we could have expected. Jordaan is only a short walk from Central Amsterdam, but much quieter, with a great mix of canal restaurants and bars. Very easy to live like a local here and experience the best Amsterdam has to offer! Frank's detailed tips on what's around also helped. <br/><br/>We will be coming back to Amsterdam, and will make a point of staying here again if it's available! Highly recommended! <br/><br/>"
13953202,"Vibeke was really a welcoming host. Her appartement was clean and really quiet wich is nice after a whole day in the old and very touristique Amsterdam. She was really kind and helpful. Thank you very much Vibeke for our nice stay at your place and also for inviting us to that super flea market with you and your brother in law! what an experience to share with you. We felt very confortable and cosy with you. It was really easy to reach Downtown Amsterdam with the bus or the tram in 10 mn and also to go out of Amsterdam to visit the waterland or other beautiful town like Haarlem or Delft.<br/>Marie-Laure"
13961474,"Stayed here with my boyfriend for three nights, the room was just as tidy and clean as the photos, if not better! Great location right on the brim of De Wallen (red light district), Amsterdam Centraal just a 5-10 minute walk away. Breakfast was served every morning in a wooden box. Will definitely come back here!!"
13989727,Todo genial. Toetsie es muy amable. Su casa es muy copada. Nos facilitó mucho nuestra estadía. También nos prestó unas bicis para recorrer la ciudad. Lo recomiendo!
14006889,"Nathalie's flat is beautiful, well located and, from the notes left by Nathalie we found it easy to orientate. The roof top garden overlooking the Joordan is a great place to relax and to eat, if you can balance your food up the ladder! The Beds are comfortable - the smaller room's bed somewhere between a single and a double but slept the two of us ok. I can see why some people might not deal with the steep steps but it is part of the character of the house. The Kitchen and living room are also spacious and comfortable to hang out on during thunder storm days. We didn't see Nathalie but she was always quick to correspond with us and made the handing over of keys very easy too. "
14041199,"Our experience in this app was not so nice, mildly put.<br/>Hans the owner was very nice, however we had quite unpleasant communications with his wife Nanette, which did not make us feel welcome already before coming.<br/><br/>In summary our experiences:<br/>1) The app in not on the ground floor as advertised but is a sous-sol, half underground<br/>2) The pictures on the website do NOT reflect the real experience: it is dark as there is almost no natural daylight, even with all lamps on it is permanently dusk, very depressing<br/>3) The sous -sol app is very humid, blankets and mattress are moist and smell of fungus<br/>4) No fresh air can come in as even if you open the windows so there is no air circulation<br/>5) Although the mattress is of an OK quality, the beds are tiny and a bit inclined due to the floor<br/>6) The second morning the bathtub was filled with 20cm of urine due to a problem with the sewage system<br/>7) All supplies left in the app were minimal, literally, so the last 3 mm of washing liquid, 1 cube of detergent, 4 cups of coffee and no soaps at all.<br/>So you could start your stay buy buying everything yourself in a already expensive app.<br/><br/>We decided to leave and booked a hotel instead, which has plenty of natural daylight, in a peaceful neighborhood and with free breakfast, which is even cheaper than this app, which was rather expensive.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"
14058222,"We stayed 3days in Ingo's flat.<br/>The flat was fantastic space, the location was super.<br/>If you are looking for a space to stay in Amsterdam. This is the right place."
14085058,It was a great place to stay! We love this area in amsterdam with all the cafe and bars and we definitely will come back again! Also the appartement with two floors was perfect for two couples. Everything was very well organized from tatjana - thanks to her! 
14104336,Lovely apartment and lovely host Frits.  Great QUIET and walkable neighborhood with a bike rental shop on the main street. Perfect place to have as a home base to explore all of Amsterdam. Eat at Sonnenveld! Bed is super comfortable.  We'll be back!
14115188,"Jasper and Susan's flat is the perfect space for adults, especially those who like to hangout  but who have younger children.  They've decorated the place with tons of interesting and inspiring art. The location is easy walking distance to the Jordaan area, and central city. But you don't have to deal with the annoying crowds of the city center. <br/>They have a gorgeous open plan kitchen and funky dining table with chairs for kids too. <br/>They were incredibly welcoming to us and our toddler, allowing us to use their baby gear like toys (tons of toys!) high chairs, plates and cutlery.  Having all of that equipment there was a huge help. <br/>The space is definitely decorated for adults but they've taken precautions to keep crawling or walking kids safe.  <br/>They were very accommodating and patient with us. This space is worth the price, for sure. "
14133837,"Toetsie was a wonderful host!  Very communicative before and during  and after the stay, letting me know what was the best way to get there, providing suggestions of local places to visit, and mailing me the things that I accidentally left there...  Extra perks: juice, coffee, bread, and spreads for breakfast, plus she left a bottle of wine for me to enjoy during my stay!  I consumed part of that bottle on the roof hanging out with Toetsie and Roky.  :)<br/><br/>The space is a little tighter than I had thought, but it was great nevertheless.  It was close enough to every place I wanted to visit (especially on a bike) and felt very safe.  I recommend Toetsie's place wholeheartedly!"
14135296,"It was an absolute pleasure to stay at Edwin's home. The house itself was the perfect space for the six of us staying. Big, spacious open plan kitchen living space with a large dining table perfect for dinner in the evening. The terrace on to the canal is also a highlight, great for relaxing in the evening. The bedrooms also offer comfortable beds and a great amount of space. The apartment was impeccably clean and we were well looking  after with beer, wine and snacks to welcome us. It was easy to communicate with Edwin who's also super helpful. Location-wise the apartment is very close to local transport and easy to get into the center. Overall, highly recommend!"
14150722,"It was fantastic, we loved our stay in this beautiful house in a quiet place. Femke was very helpful and flexible. We spent a very nice time there and I recommend this place 100%! Everything was perfect and we felt like at home. "
14182885,"Thanks for the great time in your beautiful B&B. Clean, calm and great breakfast-basket in front of the door every morning. We'll be back one day."
14191644,Fantastic apartment and fantastic host. Fully recommended. 
14213171,"Toetsie has a wonderful, quiet apartment where you really have the feeling of being at home. Comfortable bed, quiet neighborhood and a nice breakfast. This place is a real treasure, it just cannot be explained, you have to experience it for yourself! <br/>Toetsie is a very welcoming, friendly host that cares for you and really wants you to have the best possible stay. My best AirBnB experience so far! Will for sure stay there next time I'm in Amsterdam, and I highly recommend this place for others."
14216718,"Loved the neighborhood the special house and the private room. Everything went smooth and easy. Thanks so much! We had a great stay at Rosie's. Her place is really cozy, full of of art work from around the world. She was really helpful and easy to talk to. Thanks again for the great stay! "
14220208,"The apartment was perfect for our needs - great location on a beautiful residential street, just footsteps from a main tramline (2), and only a few minutes' walk from a lively bar and restaurant area. <br/>The apartment itself met all our needs. It was clean, quiet and relaxing, with a beautiful little balcony. We only met Jan and his family briefly but they were friendly, informative and made it clear that they were contactable should we need them (which we didn't as everything was very straightforward). Funny quirks like having the shower in the bedroom (!) only added charm to the place and I cannot recommend this apartment enough!"
14221396,Was nice to stay there in Amsterdam with support of Vibeke. :o) She is communicative and ready to help you whenever you need. We felt free and friendly. Thank you Vibeke!
14221549,"We spent 3 nights in this super cozy apartment with nice little garden. It's on a great location, some 15 mins walk to the city center and Mirjam and Didi were very helpful and great hosts. "
14241259,"Beautiful and clean room, close to the main railway station and located directly in the city centre. All major sightseeing spots are in walking distance. We really enjoyed our stay at this place."
14295396,"Very difficult walk up, extremely small space... Rat noises running around the roof"
14336469,"Mijef and Henk were extremely hospitable and welcoming, they made us feel at home as soon as we came to the apartment. The area of the apartment is great very close and central to the different areas of Amsterdam. The apartment was very tidy and clean, and was great to accommodate me and my five friends. Staying there has been a great pleasure for me and the rest of my company. "
14366204,"I really enjoyed my stay at Rosie's place. The room is cosy and nice, everything is clean and comfortable. Rosie and Matt are great hosts and very open and friendly people, really helpful and always willing to give good advice on where to go and what to see. I loved our talks over brekfast, they always made my day. The neighborhood is very peaceful and calm, so you can easily sleep with the window open and walk back home late at night by yourself without feeling uncomfortable. The city centre and all the sights are in walking distance, but you can also get around by publilc transport. I will definitely come back to Amsterdam and stay at Rosie's again! "
14370566,"The welcome: I felt wonderfully welcomed by Toetsie, with her terrific smile and warm, super-friendly personality.   I arrived mid-afternoon and she was working in her soap-making studio near her apartment , so I went there to meet her and get the key. Since she had the time, she accompanied me the two blocks to the apartment.<br/>The room/apartment: I was in the single room, which has a big window and, at the other end of the room, double French glass doors which open into the shared sitting area.  You can close the doors and curtains for complete privacy, and open them for light.  There's a kitchen alcove well stocked and Toetsie provides bread and cheese,  juice for breakfast. Although you share the space and the bathroom with 1-2 other guests, I never felt crowded or had trouble getting use of the bathroom, and I was never bothered or awakened by other guests coming and going.Best of all, you get to enjoy the rooftop terrace/garden which Toetsie joyfully shares with her guests! <br/>The neighborhood: a real neighborhood, with lots of different types of small  Restaurants just a block away, and a GReAT shop for cheese, wine, etc (erik's) and an organic market. The people in the neighborhood were all very friendly, and it was an easy walk to the tram and to many sites, and the tram goes directly to Centraal Station.<br/>Summary: a wonderful, artsy, welcoming, comfortable, charming place made oh, so special by the inimitable, incomparable Toetsie, who I now consider a special friend after just a 3-day stay.  I miss you, Toetsie!"
14402193,"We had a fantastic stay in Egija's houseboat. It is located on a quiet canal, minutes away from the city center. It is close to a busy road, but we barely heard the traffic noise from the boat. The house is clean and in perfect conditions,  and Egija's organization for check-in/out was perfect. Staying on a canal definitively gave a ""cachet"" to our stay. I would recommend this houseboat to anyone."
14408507,We've enjoyed our staying a lot at Stephanie & Sebastian's house. Sebastian welcomed us very warmly and gave all useful information to get used to the area.<br/>Studio was exactly the same as described. House location is very good since it's just in front of tram stop and can be reached easily by tram and bus both on day and night.<br/>I highly recommend Stephanie & Sebastian's cosy studio to everyone who looks for a great Amsterdam experience.
14409305,"Viola nous a très bien accueilli bien que bien loin de Amsterdam elle s’est débrouillé pour que nous puissions récupérer les clefs de son charmant appartement au café du coin. L'appartement est situé à 20min à pied de la garde centrale dans un quartier très calme et jolie. Il est d'ailleurs exactement comme sur les photos du site. Merci Viola !<br/><br/>Even thought Viola wasn't in Amsterdam when we arrive, she let appartment' keys in a café for us. His appartment is well place in a calm and beautiful quarter at 20min from the station. He is  exactly like pictures. Thanks a lot Viola.<br/>"
14414165,"Me and my sister stayed a few days with Joke. She is a very friendly and helpful host. The house was clean and the room was very comfortable. Joke made us delicious breakfasts, whith a variety of both healthy and tasty food. We spoke with Joke in english and in portuguese, which she dominates completely. Besides, she gave us some helpfull tips about the city and transports. Overall, it was a perfect stay with all the comfort and familiarity that you could ask for! If you're looking for a familiar and cozy place to stay, I would recommend Joke without a doubt. "
14445941,"My stay was peaceful. The best way to get there is by Tram, if you arrive at the central station. The house is easy to find. It's in a good area to explore the city, because the guest house is very central and easily accessible. Edwin received me well, and was always available to help. Room was perfect, comfortable and clean. Surely I will come back to use this guest house again! I recommend!<br/><br/>- I found that there closely, there are direct buses to Schiphol airport. The stop is about 10 minutes walk from the guest house. Follow towards the Leidseplein, the stop is in front of the American Hotel. Start at 5am, from 15 to 15 minutes - € 5"
14450673,I Loved Nabila's studio! It's secluded.. Super zen has a backyard patio and the canal is literally in your backyard. The accommodations were so clean so modern I had everything I needed (including Heineken) to have a great stay! Nabila herself is an excelled gracious kind and warm<br/>Hearted host. She made me feel like I was at home in her home. This place is perfect for couples or a single traveller like myself. THANK YOU NABILA!!! 
14494741,"Very good place in amsterdam, we really enjoy our trip in this studio. <br/>Very nice area and Frits give us many good advices. <br/>"
14519760,"Stephanie and Sebastian were great hosts for our 3-day trip to Amsterdam. They were very welcoming, made us discover great spots in the area and communicated with us within minutes when required. The place is small, but just enough for 1 or 2 guests and is in the perfect location (close to town, away from tourists, green, with many local places to go to)."
14541337,"Rosie is a delightful and thoughtful host. She genuinely wants her guests to have a good stay and does her best to make sure of that. The apartment is very conveniently located, easy to reach from the airport and easy to access major attractions. It is also clean and comfortable. "
14542223,A cosy apartment which is not noisy at night! Bronte kindly left a map and instructions in the apartment for our reference. She was very efficient in responding to messages and was great as a host. 
14551003,Such a lovely home! Nestled in a beautiful part of Amsterdam (conveniently around the corner from my cousin). Décor was sweet and homey. Very glad I stayed here!
14553776,"our time in Marieke's appartment was perfect ! really great location, spacious and quiet.<br/>we were riding the city by bike ´ so lovely to rest in your place after a good riding day along the canals ´ thanx ´"
14628437,"Rosie and Matthew were excellent hosts - both very interesting, welcoming and friendly. The room was comfortable and very clean and accurate to the listing. <br/><br/>The neighbourhood was lovely - it is just off Beethovenstraat with good transport links to the centre of town (about ten minutes by tram and about 20 minutes walking to the Museum quarter) and about a 15 minute walk to Beatrix Park and the RAI. There are lots of cafes and restaurants nearby. <br/>"
14638508,David was available by phone and in person.  He let us keep our luggage at the room until it was cleaned and ready.
14650953,"We arrived late in Amsterdam due to flat tire, thus was not able to personally meet Egija. But the times I called and emailed her with questions, she was always helpful and prompt. Check in was easy, (black box), thus no late check in fees. We were lucky to find a parking spot right in front of the house- expensive, but we were using the small, spare tire and it was a Sat. evening, no open tire shops. The house boat was simply amazing, clean, big, nicely decorated and with several live orchids in bloom! It has washer and dryer and bath tub. And walking distance to sights, shops and restaurants. Or you can just stay in and gaze at the canal, the ducks and at the nice canal houses. Very relaxing. Safe neighborhood. Will be back in a heartbeat. Thank you Egija for sharing your place."
14653187,Hein was away but josse was waiting for us and it was easy to communicate with her. The place was very small but clean and close to the center. It was very basic but it has what is most needed.
14657424,"This home of Nathalie's is a real gem. Spacious, light and stylish - as per the photos - and in a perfect location. Our family of four, felt entirely comfortable there and we all had some space in which to escape, which was a joy. We entertained friends we have in Amsterdam on the roof terrace and it was wonderful. Our boys enjoyed watering the plants.<br/>Nathalie was responsive and sought to meet our requirement to stay longer. The stairs are a genuine Amsterdam experience, best not to haul a lot of luggage up them - but once you are in, it is worth the effort. We highly recommend this as a great place to stay, to enjoy Amsterdam. Thanks Nathalie, your home made our return trip to Amsterdam, a place we once called home, a fantastic occasion. Four stars."
14667769,I love this b and b this is my second time staying here and it won't be my last It's in a great location aswell..the best it waking up to the view it makes ur time in Amsterdam more special and the room is great big spacious and very clean i would give this place 11 if I could thanks for having us untill we visit again
14693848,"Lovely, quiet room with everything I needed. All good."
14705558,"Although Edith was away when we stayed, we were made very welcome by a neighbour and Edith provided us with a bottle of wine to compensate for some minimal building works outside the flat. We did not know the room was self-contained until we arrived or that is was up 66 stairs (not a problem for us, but definitely not for the infirm or those with very young children). The area was really quiet but central. "
14715919,David was a wonderful host and the room is perfect.  It was clean and the location was central with convenience of necessities around the area.  We had a wonderful stay at David's place and we highly recommend it for your trips to Amsterdam.
14716821,"Very friendly host and a nice room. Stayed two nights, abd would do it again. Its not far from the Center and close to a park."
14732075,Had a very nice stay at Toetsie´s Place. We surprisingly even had 2 rooms for us. Loved the rooftop terrace! and Rokky the cat.
14744271,"Incredible apartment in the perfect location. <br/>Would definitely recommend to anyone!<br/>"
14749483,"Brenda was a great host. She quickly accepted the request, confirmed the reservation, and set up the exchange of keys and information in a timely and reassuring way. She let us leave our luggage before check in, having arranged apartment cleaning for arrival. The location and apartment were great, especially for kids. Vondelpark and easy access to transit, and reasonable walk to the museums and canals. Nice to have wifi/computer access. Great neighbourhood. Great time."
14768723,"David welcomed us on arrival and made a phone call for us.  Fresh fruit was provided for our enjoyment every day.  Our room was very clean and in a perfect location for walking almost everywhere or catching public transportation.  We absolutely loved our room that overlooked  a canal and the many people passing by.  This is a busy, vibrant area and we highly recommend it if you like being in the middle of the action."
14786901,"Excellent place to stay in Amsterdam. It was the perfect location for our first time in Amsterdam and provided everything we needed for a relaxing stay. David gave excellent directions from airport. The room is nice and clean, double bed on the bedroom was really comfortable. Could not have been better! We would definitely stay here again!"
14791749,"Grande et confortable maison, dans une rue très calme dans le joli quartier des canaux sud (classé UNESCO), à deux pas du Prinsengracht.<br/>Bien aménagée, décoration soignée, parfait pour une famille. Terrasse et jardin plein sud.<br/>Supermarchés, restaurants, tramways à 5 minutes.<br/>Rijk, Van Gogh et Stedelijk museums, Leidesplein et Leidestraat, à 10 minutes à pied.<br/>Hotes aux petits soins.<br/>A refaire !<br/>"
14810861,"Vibeke was a great host, she was warm, friendly, and very helpful. Unfortunately, our schedules did not overlap, so my friends and I did not get to interact with her as much as we would have liked. She did give us tips on where to shop and eat, which were very helpful.<br/>The room was bright, comfortable and perfect for a short stay (3 nights). We only used the kitchen for breakfast but it was always available to us. The apartment is about 3 km away from the center of the city, but the walk into town is quite pleasant/there is a bus stop just down the street from the apartment."
14827406,"The boat was nice as well as Olaf. I organised a surprise birthday we for my boyfriend and Olaf and his wife helped us! A bit far from the city center but that's the price to pay when you are a big group. It was warm enough, and the bedding was ok. We had some trouble with the beer tap, there was no gas anymore, which could have been noticed earlier. That was the only annoying thing, anything else was fine. And we made some noise during the evening/night without any trouble. I would recommend Olaf's boat if you are a big group !"
14829217,"Vibeke was a great host, giving us great tips for our trip in Amsterdam and was so friendly! Thank you very much for having us. "
14847906,"Die Unterkunft ist super zentral gelegen. Francina und Matthijs sind hervorragende Gastgeber. Das Zimmer und das Bad waren beide sauber, modern und gut eingerichtet. Auch von der Größe her sind beide Räume ideal. Das Frühstück in der Bäckerei ist ebenfalls ein Plus. Nach dem Besuch (mit einem leckeren Frühstück!!!), werdet ihr wissen warum ihr Fotos gemacht habt und allen davon erzählen werdet.<br/>Wir können die Unterkunft wirklich weiterempfehlen und würden bei einem nächsten Besuch auch dort wieder buchen!<br/>Bedankt Francina en Matthijs, wij willen graag terug komen :-))"
14862341,"My girlfriend and I had an opportunity to stay at Jan's apartment a few weeks ago whilst in Amsterdam and could not have been happier with our stay. The apartment is located on a beautiful, quaint street directly outside of Vondelpark which is always packed with people soaking up the beautiful sun and cheerful vibes of Amsterdam. The area which the apartment is situated is absolutely spot on as it is, as mentioned, right outside one of Amsterdam's most beautiful parks and within walking distance of high end fashion shops, loads of bars and restaurants and Amsterdam's Van Gogh museum and the museum of modern art. Jan was extremely helpful and kind throughout our stay and made our experience all the more pleasant. I would 100% stay here again the next time I travel to Amsterdam. Highly recommended all those considering this flat for their time in Amsterdam!"
14866018,"Laura and her husband are extremely supportive, warmhearted, creative and inspiring hosts with lots of ideas and help. We absolutely recommend the stay."
14867578,"the surrounding area is great, really close to RAI which was a great advantage to us. Olaf was kind and made us feel welcome right away, plenty of space for us to work in the flat too. "
14884803,"Excellent apartment - well equipped, bright and practical. We were very comfortable and made to feel at home. <br/><br/>The location was equally great, lovely architecture, lots of bars and restaurants within a few minutes walk - also walkable to the Van Gogh and Rijksmuseum and short walk to the tram stop for Centrum. <br/><br/>Esther and the team were great hosts, very thoughtful and we were well looked after. <br/><br/>Would love to return, highly recommended!"
14897843,"Edith was a great host and the room is exactly as it shows in the pictures – stylishly decorated and cosy.<br/>The location is just perfect – a little noisy at night but if you want to stay right in the heart of Amsterdam this is ideal.<br/>Edith is a very warm and gracious host and she was great at communicating up to and during our stay.  My fiancée and I were visiting the city for a friend’s wedding so we were out most of the time but when I mentioned to Edith we were keen to head to a festival the next day she very kindly printed out great directions for us on how to get to get there via public transport.<br/>Would highly recommend staying here if you are looking for a comfortable room to rest your head.<br/>"
14943384,I really enjoyed my short stay. Toetsie is and excellent host and her apartment is perfect for great nights rest close to the centre of town. Highly recommended.
14978984,"Viola and Daniel's place was amazing! I stayed at their apartment for two weeks with a friend of mine. This was my first Airbnb experience and my standards are now held high! <br/>First you must know - The apartment itself is much nicer than the photos let on! It is spacious, energetic, comforting and a great location in the city! The apartment overlooks a canal with massive windows - eating breakfast or dinner watching the boats go by is definitely NOT a terrible experience ! Grocery store, cafes, eateries and vintage shopping is all just a few blocks down the road (2-3 minute bike ride) and central Amsterdam is only a 10 minute bike ride away for night life/places to eat ! About 5 minutes away (by bike) there is a larger body of water where you can sit on a pier and watch the sunset or have a picnic. There are bike racks right downstairs if you are looking to rent a bike during your stay. <br/>Viola and Daniel had everything we needed to feel at home for our two week stay - washer, dryer, extra sheets, towels, amazing kitchen, books, wifi - the works ! <br/>The hosts themselves were wonderful and easily accessible. Whenever we had a question they were always quick to send us a message or give us a call.<br/>We met Daniel upon our arrival where he took us to the location and explained the details of the apartment. They had set up some Brochures and booklets for suggestions on places to go including a city map and a general info booklet about the city of Amsterdam ! <br/>I would recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in Amsterdam - it is a great location and a wonderful apartment! If I return to Amsterdam again in the future -  I will be looking to see if this place is available ! <br/>"
14994310,"Laura and Arjan were so nice!!!! They did everything to make our stay as pleasant as possible! They helped with airport transfer, directions and advice, and even made dinner reservations for us at an Indonesian restaurant, which was delicious! Arjan took us on a boat ride which was magical. Using the bikes was very helpful too, it allowed us the bike everywhere. The apartment itself is historic and beautiful. Very clean and comfortable. This place is special! Highly recommended!!!! We hope to stay there again one day :) "
15002636,"Enith was a very accomodating and nice host, who gave us lots of help and nice, strong coffee, even though see was in a hurry! Snacks. Soft bed and a nice, calm area 15 minutes by tram from The station. A warm recommendation!"
15002645,"The place is exactly as shown and described on the website: a small but cosy room with kitchen essentials (great coffee!), bathroom and sitting area, all shared with another guest. The house and flat are very authentic and typical for the city. I really liked the neighbour hood close to a great park, shops, bars and restaurants all nearby. <br/><br/>Toetsie was a fabulous host, welcoming, open and very uncomplicated. She provided lovely organic breakfast basics which we could then prep for ourselves. <br/><br/>I would definitely come back! "
15004139,"Sally is a perfect host! The communication before our arrival was very good and we knew what we could expect. Sally showed us everything and also prepared a manual with descriptions for the usage of e.g. the TV and the coffee machine, which was very useful. The apartment is located very close to Vondelpark and public transporation. A super market and a lot of cafes and restaurants are just around the corner. Everything was clean, tidy and cozy in the apartment! We felt home right away and enjoyed cooking and drinking wine in the kitchen. We had an amazing weekend in Amsterdam and can just recommend Sally`s place:)"
15021999,"La habitación es grande y muy acogedora.El desayuno cada mañana en la puerta fue una sorpresa que no esperábamos y nos encantó!La ubicación genial,muy céntrico, se puede ir andando a todos los puntos de interés. David muy amable!Repetiría sin ninguna duda."
15036780,Our stay at Femke's apt was perfect. The apt is very bright and have a big living area where my friends and I enjoyed to spend time and relax a bit after a full day of sightseeing. The connection to the city center is very convenient and Femke gave us useful tips to find new places and provided us with maps and leaflets of the main attractions.<br/>We really recommend it!
15045723,"siamo stati solo una notte , ma e facile da raggiungere con mezzi publici ..secondo me un po' caro x il tipo di stanza e ospitalita'.."
15059491,"Joke is a wonderful person and staying at her home was a perfect experience!the house is very beautiful, with a wonderful and big room, very clean.she made for us something especial for breakfast (everything organic and really delicious!).It's also in a good position, near from everything!!!I'm just thinking when to come back again!!!"

15083523,"Everything was more than perfect. The flat was clean, fully equipped, really comfortable and very very nice! It is also very close to the city center and in a very nice area (about 10min by tramway n.17). The kitchen was equipment with everything that we needed, bread, milk, eggs, tea, coffee, fruits and beer! <br/>The Apartment has 2 comfortable bed rooms, a nice bathroom and a huge living room with an open kitchen in it. At our disposal there were lots of towels, washing machine and dryer. The welcome was great and I absolutely recommend rick's apartment."
15085784,Quel plaisir de séjourner chez Maike et Caspar! L endroit est très calme avec beaucoup de charme. La pièce est joliment décorée. Le petit déjeuner est frais et copieux. Je recommande vivement !
15089860,"What a great place, sunny and bright, short walk to the buses to central Amsterdam. Or do what I did and rent a bike and truly experience Amsterdam. After only a couple days at this apartment i was dreaming of staying there long term, it was so comfortable. My favourite Airbnb experience thus far! <br/>"
15094713,"Ingo & Marlies were perfect hosts, reactive and accommodative. The location of the flat is really great right in the center of Amsterdam, with all facilities needed and very close to transportation, shops and attractions. You really feel at home thanks to the great list of recommandations they left us. The accommodation is bright, spacious and exactly as described in the photos. Would highly recommend staying here to discover Amsterdam and enjoy the real experience of the Venice of the North."
15098051,Kind and welcoming hosts.  A very clean and tidy apartment in a nice area.  With easy access for exploring the city.  Would return here without hesitation!  
15101083,"Josien was a wonderful host in all possible aspects. <br/>Everything was so clean and well organized, and she was really caring about all my concerns and went beyond my expectations. I had a great experience, and definitely recommend it. The metro station is really close to the place where you can easily reach anywhere in the city. =)"
15103794,"Vivi dias muito bons hospedada aí! O apartamento fica num bairro lindo e muito próximo do centro. É possível fazer tudo a pé ou de bicicleta. A Rosie e o Matthew, além de oferecem um bom café da manhã, são realmente muito gentis e me ajudaram com diversas dicas sobre a cidade, que é encantadora."
15113566,"Andreas place is very beautiful, nice style, clean and big. She is an amazing host, very friendly and helpful and interested in that her guests are well. I certainly can recomend her place to everybody."
15204109,"Everything was just perfect. David was very nice although we arrived very late in the evening, the room was very clean and looked just like in the pictures. Thank you. We had a very nice stay here (11 days in October 2014)"
15212907,"Me and my friend had a wonderful time at Edwins place. The house is right in the heart of Amsterdam. Everything's reachable within walking distance.<br/>The room was nice and cosy as the rest. Edwin is a great host and such a kind person. And we just loved his cat Pookie.   Staying at Edwin`s place was the best experience. Lovely place right in the heart of Amsterdam. Edwin is an excellent host and a kind person. Will definitely stay there again. It was my third stay at Edwins place. Everything was just perfect. Thank you Edwin for making my stay fabulous! Nice and cosy place close to Centraal Station. Very good location in a nice neighborhood. Jan was a great host. Would highly recommend if you are looking to stay in Amsterdam. We had a great stay at Nienke`s house. She was very helpful and a kind host. We were welcomed with lost of food and drinks. The place was clean and cosy just a few minutes by bus from Amsterdam Centraal station. Nice restaurants and cafes around. Thanks for everything!"
15218379,"I had a very lovely time at the gardenhouse of Marga and her family. There is peace and quiet. I was there on a work trip and everything was great, even though I did not spend a lot of time there as I was mostly away. This is great place to stay if you want to visit Amsterdam but don't feel like staying in the midst of a busy city. If you take a bike everything is easy to reach. The gardenhouse is quite spacious, especially when you are travelling alone. I will definitely come back here next time I need to visit Amsterdam for a couple of days!"
15220642,"Charlie was really good at informing us before and during the stay even though she was busy with her store so we did not met her. We felt welcome and the description matched the reality. The neighbourhood was nice and calm with a lot of small stores and we felt very safe during our stay. We had some problems with the cat in the beginning but ind the end we became close friends ! (most of the time :) ) unfortunately we dont have the same cleaning standard, and we are only used to have the cat and its hair outside of our house. we would not recommend it to people who dont have any experiences with cats, but despite that we had a lovely stay in the apartment."
15226780,"I can't reccomend this place enough. From the moment we got there, Matthijs was amazing. The room was about a 20 min walk from the train station station and perfectly located. Once we got there, Matthijs gave us a a great overview of the house and the city. <br/><br/>Throughout the trip, he was available for questions and kept the room perfectly clean. I would highly reccomend this place for anyone in Amsterdam. "
15232281,"Fantastic host, fantastic place! Super close to the centre of the city. Would most definitely stay here again!!! "
15233284,"I had an excellent short stay with Marga and her family. The setting is beautiful and is a tram ride from the centre of Amsterdam, approx 20 minutes. Marga was kind enough to offer me 2 car rides during my overnight stay. No criticisms, thank you!<br/><br/>Je passais un séjour court excellent avec Marga et sa famille. La maison est belle et est approximativement 20 minutes de centre d'Amsterdam par tram. Marga a eu la gentillesse de me conduire 2 fois pendant ma nuitée. Aucune problèmes, merci!"
15245375,"Marieke is the best host ever! She's so caring and kind. Friendly introduced us a lot of awesome places in amsterdam when we arrived. She also prepared a welcome gift for us, which is super sweet. The studio is awesome itself, very spacious, you got everything you need there. Unfortunately I'm too short to get on the bike or it would be a fun time cycle around since everyone does that :P Anyways, we thank Marieke again for letting us had such great memories in amsterdam."
15256538,"Albertine is a very friendly and welcoming host! She gave us many tips and told us all the coolest places to hang out in Amsterdam! She is definitely a GREAT host.<br/>The apartment itself is very cosy and decorated with taste. It is also very well located, close to everything but out of the crazy tourist area... We really liked the neighboorhood! <br/>If you plan to visit the real Amsterdam, you should definitely book this place!!!"
15266121,"Met mijn man heb ik 4 dagen doorgebracht in dit mooie studio, heel comfortabel en compleet. Het voelde net als thuis. Bijna alles was aanwezig voor gebruik. Het enige wat wij mistten is een flatscreen tv met usb aansluiting zodat wij via de laptop films konden kijken. Nabila was wel heel aardig en heeft goed voor ons gezorgd.. wij konden ook met alle vragen bij haar terecht. Hele fijne buurt en met een tram ben je zo in centraal. Al met al zijn wij zeer tevreden wij komen zeker nog een keer. "
15301727,"Laura und Christian, haben uns sehr nett in Empfang genommen, wir haben uns sehr wohl in dem Haus gefühlt. Die Katzen sind super süß und sehr zutraulich. Der Kontakt zu den beiden war auch sehr angenehm, wir würden nochmal diese Wohnung buchen! Sehr zu empfehlen. "
15306690,"Overall we had a great stay at Henry's house. The location was amazing and could walk to everything we wanted to do. We only saw Henry briefly over the three days but he was very helpful and gave us all the information that we needed and at the same time let us have our own space. The apartment was perfect size for what we needed, a bedroom, a living room and a bathroom which were exactly as the photos had shown us. The only slight downside of the stay was the cleanliness of the apartment - on the whole it was very clean but the hot tub when we arrived was dirty which meant we had to clean it for about 15 minutes before we could use it and also we woke up every morning with lots of bites over us which could have been mosquitos but looked a lot smaller and much more like bed bugs. Despite this, we would thoroughly recommend staying here as the positives massively outweigh the slight negatives so do not hesitate to book with Henry!"
15307939,"Ongelofelijk gezellig appartement in een heel leuke buurt in Amsterdam. We kozen voor een ontspannend, relax weekend en daar was dit appartement ideaal geschikt voor. De zeer luxueuze keuken was een plezier om in te koken. Een aanrader voor iedereen die van mooie dingen houdt!"
15313048,"Magnifique appartement, spacieux et chaleureux dans un quartier très calme et à 100 metres de la ligne de Tram.<br/>Idéal pour un séjour de plusieurs jours pour visiter la ville.<br/>Amsterdam est une très belle ville, ses habitants sont très agréables.<br/>C'était un super séjour quoi que un peu trop court à notre gout.<br/>Nous y retournerons volontiers dans le même appartement."
15316890,"The apartment is very well located in Amsterdam. It is perfect for 4 adults, very spacy and confortible. If i come back to Amsterdam it will be my first choice."
15337436,"Our host was waiting for us outside when we arrived with a very warm welcome. We loved the B&B right away and were very comfortable our two days. She surprised us with snacks and even a small bottle of yummy wine. We had everything we needed.<br/>I loved the modern clean space.<br/>The location is awesome. Close to bus, tram and shopping.<br/>Truus left us a map with all kinds of very helpful information."
15370955,Laura e la sua famiglia si sono dimostrati subito molto disponibili e presenti. L appartamento in buona posizione rispetto al centro ha risposto alle nostre aspettative. La colazione servita da Laura ogni mattina è stata abbondante e varia. Possibilita' di ubicate la propria auto in garage privato a pagamento su richiesta a breve distanza dall' appartamento.
15375699,"Noor is the Perfect host by excellence ! The apartment was perfect, very clean, modern and spacious (exactly the same on the photo). Thank you Noor for waiting us for the late check in and for the late check out !<br/>We really enjoy Amsterdam :) <br/>I really recommend it ! <br/>"
15377237,Had a lovely stay at Wilma's. Very sweet host and the room was lovely. Highly recommended.
15393481,"Our stay in Amsterdam was all that we had hoped it would be. Very convenient for the centre, provided you are happy to hop on a bike or bus. We made good use of the bikes on both the days that we were touring the city and these were a huge help. Car parking was not a problem - this had been one of my biggest concerns - and the house was an ideal place to stay with young children. Clean and tastefully decorated etc. we didn't meet our host as he was on holiday while we were there but email communications were great."
15407925,"Great apartment & great location! The apartment was clean, homely and spacious. It was fantastically located within 20 minutes to anywhere in Amsterdam. Nathalie was very communicative and had no problems. Would  definitely use again!"
15418290,"Great accommodation offered by a lovely couple! Location was fab, outside the busy touristy centre but still a stroll away, or an easy bus ride to get to and from the central station."
15418323,"The room is perfectly located in the heart of Amsterdam. Although it is a very busy area, the room was very calm.  My sister and I really enjoyed our days at Davids'... I can only recommend you to stay there!  We had a lovely weekend at Moja’s place. The Location is just awesome, all the places we visited were in walking distance. Communication with Moja was easy and he also gave us valuable local advice :) can highly recommend to stay here!"
15425720,"We had an excellent stay in the lovely houseboat! Juul and Iris were very accommodating and welcoming - great hosts. The houseboat itself is spacious and very comfortable. Having the living space with the TV was a real bonus as we found it was great to come back to in the evenings after a full day of being in the city to chill out. It was also great to be able to cook on the days that we didn't want to eat out. The location is very accessible from the city either by bike or tram, and the area itself is quite nice. Would definitely stay here again if ever back in Amsterdam!"
15434423,"Chris was a fantastic host, who made us feel welcome and at home within moments of arriving. He looked after us throughout our stay and greatly improved our experience of Amsterdam with helpful tips and recommendations of places to go. <br/>The room we had was ideal and had plenty of room. The whole place was tidy and clean and it was really comfortable to be in the main living space when Chris was around. <br/>I would 100% recommend this listing and cannot commend Chris highly enough for how he hosted us. Even down to small details like providing us with towels and flannels, which were minor but added up to make such a difference. <br/>He was our host, now he's our friend. We will definitely be back! <br/>""Lekker, lekker, lekker."""
15452820,Excellent place to stay with a great host.
15467596,"Look no further! You've found your future airbnb! ^^ <br/><br/>The location and neighborhood is perfect. With a 20 minute metro you are already at Central station. It is a 5 minute walk to the 'World of Food' if some Surinamese or Thai food strikes your fancy. <br/><br/>After spending the day in hectic Amsterdam coming home to sit on the balcony and relax surrounded by greenery was wonderful. The room has all the amenities and most importantly a comfortable bed, heavy curtains, and some mood lighting.  <br/><br/>Simone is in all respects an ideal and knowledgeable host.  She was easy to communicate and interact with from the start. I recommend her  cozy well-organized apartment without reservation. "
15470328,"S was very very hospitable, when we arrived we found her at home, the room was clean and she gave us clean towels.<br/>She gave us some advice where we could have dinner and something to see.<br/>She was clean and respectful, it's a pleasure share the home with her.<br/><br/>v."
15482077,"La habitacion es amplia y comoda, Se encuentra en un barrio residencial a unos 15-20 en metro o transvia del centro tiempo que debe ser considerado si pretendes ir por solo 2 nochea, el host ha sido muy amable y simpatico. Lamentablemente hemos llegado muy temprano a la habitacion y nos hemos topado que la limpieza no fue muy prolija al encontrar pelos de otras personas en las sabanas, sin embargo el lugar fue comodo."
15520255,"Sehr guter Gastgeber, gutes Ambiente, sauber und ungewöhnlich. Haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt."
15527175,"Clean, kind and helpful. Super easy! Everyone should rent Sabine's apartment. "

15577896,"Amazing, amazing, amazing.  Just go.  You won't regret it! x Thomas was helpful upon arrival asking us if we needed anything and if we had any questions but as we have been to Amsterdam many times we were OK by ourselves.  He let us know just to text if we needed anythingbwhich was fab! Fantastic apartment in a fab central location. Easily walkable from station. Cool and lively yet quite and comfortable for the nights sleep. Second time we've been and won't be the last. Love it!"
15586863,"Nicolet answers my emails efficiently and always with helpful information. (eg: how to pick up the key and leave baggage at the locker in the train station…)<br/>The apartment is actually more spatial than showed in the pictures, and the location is just perfect!!! So convenient to everything. <br/>We only had 3 days in Amsterdam, tried hard to go as many places as we could, it’s a pity we didn’t have time to chill out in the cozy apartment more. If we are visiting Amsterdam again, we will definitely choose to stay here again.<br/>公寓地點超便利，空間寬敞，屋主聯繫有效率。"

15615008,"Eventhough Nima was not present as he was on holidays himself,  he was always available via mail and helped us with everything we needed. The location is nice as it's not in the busy city center but still close enough to go via ferry back and forth. We went to a festival which is at the ndsm ,not far away from the house.Thanks for the stay nima! "
15657081,"It was so awesome that we got to meet Kelli and Henk upon our arrival. They gave us loads of information like where to dine, and several places of interest to visit. On top of that, they were really fun loving and humorous. <br/>The apartment is situated in a pretty convenient location, with several eateries and small stores just around the corner. It is perhaps one of the most interesting Airbnb apartment we have stayed in (super artsy and incredibly cosy).<br/>Overall, I would recommend this place!"
15661566,"I'm sorry but unfortunately this stay was not as I expected. I knew that there would be renovations during my stay, but I would not be in the middle of a construction site. The entrance of the house was constantly encumbered by the instruments of the workers who made it uncomfortable passage. Also every night you could hear a constant and annoying hum coming from the courtyard, probably a machine powered on 24 hours a 24. In short, for the amount paid, I think frankly excessive. I wish the hosts to find the right solutions for a comfortable stay of their guests."
15710491,"Joke is a very nice host. A lot of advices, beautiful room near the tramway and very close to the center. She prepares every morning a very good breakfast with ham, cheese, fresh bread, orange juice, yogurt... All were here to begin the day in the bests conditions. Thank you very much Joke for these 4 days in your house."
15770355," Vibeke is a very friendly host and a really great person! She helped us for everything we needed, providing good advices for the trip. <br/>The apartment is cozy and clean, with a lot of privacy and very silent and  is in a convenient neighborhood too (10 min to the center by tram, every 10 min). <br/>So we think it is a perfect accomodation, highly recommended. <br/>Thank you Vibeke, we had great time :)<br/><br/>Lina & Naveh"
15821929,"La chambre comme la salle de bains sont décorés avec un goût exquis. Le lieu est calme, romantique à souhait. Les petits-déjeuners sont délicieux. Petra est très accueillante et se montre d'une très grande discrétion. La proximité au Vondelpark est un vrai bonheur. A recommander absolument !"
15857284,"Siamo stati benissimo. Matthijs è stato fantastico. Francina non c'era e non l'abbiamo conosciuta. I consigli di Matt sono stati sempre ottimi e giusti. Veramente come avere una guida personale. Il posto dove si fa colazione è bellissimo, molto particolare e la colazione è buonissima a 150 metri circa. La stanza non era grande ma a noi è andata bene ed è stata funzionale alle nostre esigenze. il bagno in comune con l'altra stanza molto spazioso e la doccia ottima. La stanza era molto silenziosa, non ha vista panoramica ma non è stato un problema. c'è tutto phon, accappatoi, asciugamani, sapone, bollitore per fare the caffè o cappuccino con i filtri del the o le bustine monodose incluse da sciogliere in acqua. Vicinissimo a piazza dam cosicchè noi potevamo tornare per riposarci un pò e riuscire, senza alcun problema. e poi ripeto Matthijs è stato un plus anzi superplus. gran bella persona. Mi ha anche fatto un bel regalo inaspettato per il mio compleanno. Ci torneremo sicuramente.<br/>grandioso il letto in legno in stile olandese con il tetto di nuvole."
15887486,"Marieke gave me a very warm welcome. I loved the open and friendly atmosphere. Marieke is a very communicative  and sensitive host. The apartment is delightful, situated in a very nice neighborhood close to the park, to the museums, nice streets and shops around easy to be reached by tram. I enjoyed it and I love to come back."
15923632,"Nous avons passé un excellent séjour Amsterdam grâce aux conseils et au très chaleureux accueil de Vibeke. Elle a été disponible à tous moments, nous a indiqué les bons plans pour la location de vélo et les restos, les endroits à découvrir, ceux qu'elle affectionne tout particulièrement…Vraiment, un très grand plaisir de l'avoir rencontrée.<br/>La chambre est sobre, spacieuse, lumineuse et donne sur un petit jardin. Le quartier est très calme et le tram à 2 min à pied. Mais pour ceux qui aiment, le vélo c'est vraiment l'idéal . Ne pas hésiter à longer la côte et aller en vélo vers les anciens villages. Nous avons alterné baignade et vélo sous le soleil, c'était génial. Merci encore à Vibeke"
15939206,"AMAZING!!! Perfect location, close to all the main places. The apartment is excellent, with a great hot tub and a nice balcony. Very much recommended!"
15944619,"Olaf's home is confortable, colorful and fun, just like him :) He was a great host, made us feel at home, giving us privacy and at the same time was available for any questions. The location is great, not in the middle of the city center but with easy access by foot or public transports :)"
15952203,"I stayed at Toetsie's for two weeks. Within only 20 minutes bike ride from the Central Station Everything was nice, from the check-in to the check out. The room was spotless and decent size. I was able to use the kitchenette to make some food. The bathrooms were very comfortable for showers and the rest. Overall, I had a great stay and I would not hesitate to recommend the room to anyone interested in visiting Amsterdam. Toetsie was very nice and helpful throughout my staying, she provided towels and food for the first few days, together with a nice bottle of... wine! :) Happy days!"
15956473,"Our first time using airB&B so we weren't sure what to expect...Overall the apartment was fine for our stay with it being close to everything, cooking facilities,space and the host left plenty of information for us! The only negatives that we found were that it was a bit dirty (we had to wash the plates/cups/pots/pans before we used them) and there was a mouse problem...after we left bread sticks out completely sealed unopened, they were eaten through each night! Once that is sorted for the money we paid we believe its about on par with what to expect."
15958767,"Casa spettacolare , molto più bella di quel che risulta dalle foto , il proprietario è gentilissimo e molto disponibile, wifi, tv nuova, sistema sonos, grande ed illuminato bagno con terrazzino all'ultimo piano dove c'è l camera da letto, cucina completa con vista sul salone , posizionato in una zona lussuosa e tranquilla seppur a 10 min a piedi dal centro pieno di amsterdam . Assolutamente consigliata !"
15969292,"Corina was the perfect host who offered us very useful advice on travel / getting around as well as provided us with more than the basic necessities that made our stay extremely easy and memorable. <br/>The room itself is great. It feels like a separate home since it is on the first floor and Corina lives on floor above. The private bathroom and garden makes it a complete steal for the price! The location is terrific with a ton of great restaurents nearby and all the famous spots are within walking distance or as the locals would say - ""...XY canals away...""<br/>We will definitely be staying here again. "
15970034,"Nous avons été très bien accueilli par Jordis, qui nous a indiqué quelques bonnes adresses et un bon plan pour stationner pas cher à deux pas de chez elle.<br/>Son appartement lumineux est très agréable et bien situé dans une rue tranquille et dans un quartier vivant et commerçant, desservi par le tram. Après avoir traversé le superbe Vondelpark on est aussitôt dans le centre d'Amsterdam. Bref, c'est une excellente adresse!"
16028818,"Jesse is a nice guest and the appartment is very well located.<br/>He made us feel at home, everything was ready for our arrival (clean towels, clean sheets, clean appartment).<br/>The bathroom is a bit small and would need some rework but the global atmosphere is really great !<br/>Felt like home and was not that expensive ! Thanks Jesse"
16031793,"Een appartement in de Vrolikstraat, dat beloofde! en ik werd inderdaad al verliefd op de straat: haast aan ieder raam bloemen en planten, geurige rozen gewonnen op het voetpad. Hartelijke gastvrouw Toetsie dan toonde mijn stek voor de nacht: een kunstenaarsplekje! ik voelde me er helemaal thuis! Supergezellig en om het plaatje compleet te maken, Rockie de rode kat des huizes liet zich mooi aanhalen Een plaats om asap naar terug te keren: Amsterdam in Casa Vrolik!! "
16042497,"Tranquila zona en un barrio del norte de Amsterdam, muy bien comunicado mediante autobús (nº 34) todo y que es aconsejable tomar siempre la bicicleta para moverse por la ciudad (es el encanto!). <br/>La habitación es tal como se ve, ni más ni menos, para mi gusto todo correcto menos el echo de tener que abrir y cerrar con llaves 3 puertas cada vez que se quiera salir o entrar. <br/>Baño pequeño compartido con otros inquilinos, no problema en este aspecto aunque podría mejorar. Lo recomiendo para una pareja de aventureros como nosotros! <br/>Jeroen muy amable en todo, un 10 para él. Nos recomendo barrios y lugares con encanto lejos de la multitud turística para encontrar la esencia de la ciudad, impresionante.<br/>"
16079417,"The nieghtbougd is very nice and quiet, walking distance from the city center! The room is very clean and with enough space for two, the bedding is great! Too bad, we can't use the kitchen at least to put some water in the freezer! <br/>Klaartje is a great host, very available and helfull! Thank you!"
16105319,"Staying at Evert's place was wonderful! It is a perfect location--walking distance to Central Station (even with suitcases) and to everything else in the city, yet still quiet at night. The room looked exactly as advertised and had everything you could need for a night or a week-long stay in Amsterdam. Evert was very helpful with letting us leave our bags in the home prior to check-in and after check-out. Restaurant recommendations, guide books and other helpful information is in the room and available for use. Coffee, tea, chocolate and stroopwafels were also waiting for us upon arrival. We could not recommend this place more! Thank you Evert!"
16126493,"Our stay at Nicole's apartment was absolutely marvelous. First of all, her apartment is full of good vibes and light with a fantastic view on the canal. Then, the decoration is full of character and charisma. And finally, she is delightful and welcoming.<br/>We were even sad to leave her apartment after more than a month there and definitely have it in our hearts. Marielle was lovely and kind. Her apartment is very cute and is a sweet place to stay few days in Amsterdam. Recommended, especially for those who are not afraid to climb ""Dutch stairs"". :)"
16130226,"Everything was just amazing in our trip! We were there for St. Valentines and it was absolutely a great place! Toetsie was pendent of us all the time, she was very kind and helpful. He had some bread juice eggs etc to prepare small dinner n breakfast and also a bottle of wine! ;) the facilities of the house were good.<br/>The neighbourhood was ok, just some minutes to city centre by metro.<br/>I would repeat if I go back to Amsterdam! "
16145164,"The. Best.  The listing description was accurate and the apartment is even more beautiful in person than the photos!  Wonderful hosts who welcome you like old friends and are very responsive, whether by airbnb email or phone.  Great location, lots of local restaurant and shopping recommendations from the hosts.  Overall this was like unlocking an Airbnb VIP experience!  Spotlessly clean, fully stocked fridge at our disposal - WOW!  Thank you so much Constanze and Boris, if we ever come back to Amsterdam we know exactly where we'd like to stay :-)."
16165683,"Das typische Dutsch Haus von Jasinka erfüllt alle Erwartungen, es ist sehr gemütlich, schön eingerichtet und sauber. Es befindet sich in einem ruhigen Wohnquartier, ist jedoch Zentrumsnah gelegen ca. 15min mit Metro (Metrostation ca. 10min Fussweg)."
16166877,"Nice place, very good situation in a quiet neighborhood, near from the center. Vibeke is very available and gave us a lot of information.  "
16173131,Perfect location while we were at an exhibition at the rai. Nice spacious apartment and easy to get to central tourist area as well.
16173185,"Daniella was able to turn a two-day reservation into a three-day reservation at the last minute, which helped with my trip.  Even though she was gone on holiday, her friend was very helpful in getting me keys and giving good tips for my first visit to town.<br/><br/>The apartment indeed is well-situated for utilizing Amsterdam's great public-transit system.  I got around all over with very few problems.<br/><br/>While the apartment's WiFi signal is strong in the main room, I was not able to maintain the signal in the room I was staying in down the hall, which was frustrating at times.  However, it sounds like this has been an ongoing issue Daniella has been trying to resolve with her provider, a problem that people from all over can relate to, I'm sure."
16176681,"Nous étions 2 adultes et 2 adolescents, le logement était parfaitement adapté. Quartier très agréable avec canal juste en face et parc, le tout très typique. Femke était absente, c'est sa mère qui nous a très gentillement accueillis. Environ 20'de tram direct du centre, et 25' à pied à travers un parc des musées. Parking facile mais cher comme partout à Amsterdam. Bonne adresse."
16179312,Really nice and small apartment at perfect location in Joordan.  
16186317,No surprises staying with Simone.....friendly and adapts well to our schedule and needs.A short walk to the Metro station and then a 15 min ride directly into the Centraal Station and Amstersam.The dogs are friendly and very quite.The beds/matresses are in great shape which helps after a long day visiting the delightful city of Amsterdam and getting a good night sleep !
16255056,"Really nice flat in great area, the perfect place to stay and explore Amsterdam. It is located in a lovely district and is very close to public transport stations, shops, bars and restaurants. The apartment is very well-equipped, we had everything we needed there. It is even better than in the pictures - spacious, clean, cozy. We felt at home from the moment we entered the apartment and lived for some days like locals. It is perfect for two couples, the two rooms are on the same floor but you can have your privacy if you want because they are separated by a small corridor and each room has its own set of keys. Esther and team were great hosts and she was so kind to arrange a place for us to leave our luggage when we arrived before the check-in. We had perfect communication before and during our stay, Esther was always so friendly and helpful.<br/>I would definitely stay there again if I come back to Amsterdam and I highly recommend this cozy studios apartment."
16256995,"If you want to live like a local, this is the spot for you. A 25 min bike ride to city center. It gives you time to burn off all of the amazing food. Margo and Rico are gracious hosts and I would definitely stay with them again. Thank you so much for being wonderful hosts for my birthday adventure. "
16271930,"David has created a very welcome haven for visitors.  The room is large, very tastefully decorated, large ensuite, our room had a wonderful view of the canal and is centrally located.  David knows just what a traveller needs and he has included the title things to make life easier e.g wine corkscrew and a safe.  This is a terrific place to stay and David is an excellent host.  Would highly recommend a stay with David."
16278782,"We loved Mieke's place. The room is not So big but sufficient for two persons. It has a great view and delicately decorated. She has been very helpful about giving us information and suggestions. For sure for our next trip we would like to stay again there. Just a small note, it is not very close to historical centre however you have very good transportation option. It is a perfect option who  prefers quite and calm location."
16283568,"La habitación esta en muy buena ubicación, la anfitriona nos mando indicaciones por sms en el ultimo momento para asegurarse de que llegáramos bien y se mostró muy dispuesta en ayudarnos a cualquier cosa que necesitáramos.<br/>La habitación esta muy cuidada y limpia, con espacio suficiente para las maletas y para dejar la ropa en la cómoda. El baño es amplio y limpio, con secador, jabones y albornoces."
16290534,Location is great. Mike was a great host. Replies to any question immediately. Definitely stay here again next time we visit Amsterdam. Highly recommend the place.
16338309,"The studio was perfect. Great location near the Centraal Station, next to the river. Also, the studio is very clean and fonctional. The beds was extremely comfortable, we slept like three baby in this studio. Raul leave us some foods/drinks for the breakfast too. <br/><br/>Raul is very nice and kind. I recommend this studio ;)"
16400329,"This was truly a lovely place to stay- we so enjoyed how quiet it was- we kept sleeping in! Very peaceful! A short and pretty bike ride into town- breakfast was wonderful with many options! Family was very welcoming, very special place to stay ~ highly recommend!"
16428710,"The location did not disappoint, it was delightful with lovely views from the balcony of the river. The ferry ride and walk to the apartment were great.<br/>I felt that the photographs did not quite accurately represent the apartment. It was a bit dull whereas the photos made it look light, airy and spacious. Having said that we had everything we needed and had a lovely weekend. I think a little more attention should be paid to detail, getting rid of half dead plants and supplying guests with new soap rather than used dirty soap on a rope!<br/>The thing that most confused and disappointed me was the hike in prices from an advertised £66 per night to a whopping  £134. We paid a total of £524 for a 3 night stay and it simply wasn't  worth this but we were running out of options and had no choice but to pay. <br/>So in conclusion probably worth £66 but not £134."
16451658,Zeer goede ontvangst met een flesje prosecco. 2 slaapkamers en een keuken met basisuitrusting. Geen aparte lounge. 1 slaapkamer zonder vensters en harde matras. Zeer rustig gelegen met zicht op het water. Dianne en Roel zijn heel vriendelijk en helpen je graag verder.
16453001,Great place to stay and an absolute bargain. Jeroen is a really nice guy and super helpful. Highly recommend staying at his apartment. 
16474094,"My fiancé and I had such a lovely stay at Daniel and Viola's apartment. They did everything they could to help us out from the very beginning and their kindness was very appreciated! We felt completely at home in their big, sunny apartment and were very sad to leave! Thanks again :)"
16494682,"We had a wonderful time staying with Vibeke. The apartment is very cosy, yet she still offered us lots of privacy. Also, the apartment is in a great location- very easy to get into the city centre.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this property! :) <br/>"
16528408,Great location near the centre. Didn't meet the hosts as they were away but they had arranged for a neighbour to meet us with keys & show us round - that went smoothly. House lovely as photographed. No problems with stay. Would recommend as a good base to easily reach centre & trams for travelling further afield. 
16534211,"Fenno was very welcoming and helpful, pointing us in the direction of lots of things to do that were off the beaten track. The apartment was lovely and in great condition, and the area was really nice and easy to get to the centre of Amsterdam from. We had a wonderful time! "
16538956,"Awesome apartment! <br/>Just 1 minus: there were mice in the livingroom during night. But they are taking care of it with poison. "
16548170,My stay in Amsterdam was amazing! Even though she was not in the country she still let us stay in her place instead of cancelling on us like most other hosts would have. <br/>
16566044,"Lora's place is ideal for someone on a trip that doesn't want to spend too much time in the apartment but wants to be close to everything nice in Amsterdam. She's a lovely host, very polite and helpful. Definitely recommended. "
16574905,"Super séjour chez Joke. Elle nous a super bien accueilli, son appartement est très bien situé et au calme car coté cours. L appartement est sympa mais un peu petit pour 4personnes. "
16578793,It was fine staying in the room. There was some noise from the streets and Marijke took a bath at 2 am which made a lot of noise as the room is very close to the bathroom. Marijke was a friendly host though and quite flexible with regards to check in.
16579084,"Die Gastgeberin war sehr freundlich und ihre Auskünfte auch sehr genau und hilfreich. Die Wohnung entsprach allerdings nicht den Bildern in ihrem Profil. Die Pauschale für die Reinigung sollte nicht ""umsonst"" sein, wenn man das Bad, die Küche und den Wohnraum teilt sollte ein gewisses Maß an Ordnung herrschen"
16604463,"Отличное место для проживания. Можно сказать не комната, а отдельная квартира, так как у вас имеется свой санузел и миникухня (чайник, тостер, кофемашина, холодильник. Прекрасный вид из окна на канал. Особо хочу отметить район -- уютный, рядом есть множество магазинов, до центра не далеко.<br/>Хозяйка все объяснила, показала и рассказала. Приятно было познакомится. Итог -- одно из самых лучших мест нашего проживания."
16611937,"Hannekke has been an amaizing guest. We just stay there 1 night because it had not a Wi Fi, but We would like stay all our time in Amsterdam there.<br/><br/>I reccomend 100% this houseboat.<br/><br/>Thanks for everything Hanneke.<br/><br/><br/>---------------<br/><br/>Hanneke fue una excelente anfitriona. Estuvimos alli solo una noche porque no teniamos Wi Fi, pero nos hubiese encantado quedarnos toda nuetsra estadia alli.<br/><br/>Recominedo 100% esta casa flotante.<br/><br/>Gracias por todo Hanneke!"
16634463,"Jeroen was a great host although he was busy for the weekend Nonetheless we felt welcomed all the time. He gave good recommendations to spend an awesome time in Amsterdam. Separate big room with very comfy bed but no possibility to prepare a proper meal. Would recommend it warmly, anyway."
16655056,"Bop & Mulder were very welcoming, easy going and informative.<br/><br/>We really enjoyed staying on their lovely floating home.<br/><br/>Great facilities, clean and functional. The bed was too comfy!!<br/><br/>Handy location for trams and buses to explore beautiful Amsterdam.<br/><br/>Thanks<br/>Sion & Lizzie xyz"
16673343,L’accueil de Joke a été très chaleureux. Elle nous a donné beaucoup d'informations intéressantes sur les concerts ou activités du moment à Amsterdam. Le petit déjeuner était excellent  et particulièrement  copieux. Son appartement est extrêmement  agréable et bien desservi par les transports publics. Une très bonne adresse.
16675517,Alles wie beschrieben. Sehr nette Gastgeberin und eine klasse Unterkunft für schöne Tage in Amsterdam. Immer wieder gerne ;-)
16677166,"We had a wonderful, wonderful time staying at Laura and Arjan's bed and breakfast in Amsterdam! The location is fantastic for seeing, enjoying, and walking to everything that Amsterdam has to offer while having a charming and quiet residential area to retreat to. The rental is in the lower level of Laura and Arjan's home, a beautiful house, facing the waterfront, which was constructed in 1654 and has been lovingly maintained  and renovated. The apartment itself is so cute and has everything you need and is comfortable besides. A breakfast is delivered at the time of your choosing and consists of fruit, yoghurt, croissants, cheese, jams, bread, and fresh squeezed orange juice and coffee. But best of all are the hosts themselves. Both Laura and Arjan are simply wonderful people. They genuinely want their guests to enjoy their beautiful city, and they go out of their way to ensure that everything is perfect for their guests. So many times they went above and beyond for us, we can't say enough good things about them. Simply put,  we feel as if we have made new friends! Staying with Laura and Arjan made our visit to Amsterdam very special indeed!"
16678673,"Perfect and amazing experience in esther's flat. All perfect. <br/>I recomend to everybody.<br/>Una experiencia fantástica en el apartamento de Esther. Se la recomiendo a todo el mundo. El piso es muy moderno y todo muy limpio.<br/>He quedado encantado con esta experiencia, cuando vuelva a Amsterdam repetiré sin duda.<br/>Calificación: 10/10"
16702638,My mom & I had a great time in Amsterdam. David's place is very nice and easy to find. The room is very comfortable. The view from the room is very lovely. 
16731472,"Alloggio davvero grazioso, composto da una stanza indipendente al piano terra con il bagno (doccia e lavandino) . La camera è  pulita e poi che dire Mike & Caspar sono stati davvero gentili e disponibili. <br/>Al mattino ci ha preparato una deliziosa colazione.<br/>La cosa che mi è piaciuta di più a me e la mia ragazza è la splendida vista sul mare che al mattino offre un piacevole buongiorno. Peccato solo, aver trascorso solo una notte ma in futuro sarei felice di tornarci. Zona tranquilla in 15 minuti circa si arriva alla stazione centrale"
16733236,"This is the best place to stay in Amsterdam - a quite corner but close to the centre. Very pretty, comfortable, very clean and good value for money. Anneka is a delight - she has thought of everything. I borrowed a bike so could cycle around which makes the trip so enjoyable. A lovely place for lunch right by the boat. Her baking is fantastic - go with a sweet tooth!"
16740254,"Dear hosts, thank you for meeting us and accommodating is at your lovely place. Me and my friends absolutely loved the place, the location, the conditions, the pricing and your hospitality. Although Dutch staircases seem to be very challenging we had great time and experience. We would definitely recommend you as hosts and your place.<br/>Thank you very much!"
16751145,"The apartment is very very central.<br/>Cornelie is extremely helpful with the tips re best restaurants, bars, grocery etc.<br/>Huge panoramic windows make it really bright, and multiple light sources can make it very romantic at night.<br/>Bear in mind that the sleeping area is abt. 1.5 m. high and must be reached climbing up the ladder. Mice can appear if you leave food unattended but they never did.<br/>The toilet is very tiny albeit interestingly decorated. Mind the absence of the shower curtain and don't forget to bring your own shampoo.<br/>The sofa is not leather as one may think from the pictures.<br/>Cornelie allowed to use her coffee maker which was a huge bonus."
16797203,"One of the best experiences I've had with Airbnb. Rob and Fang were very kind, and helped me out with any questions that I had. Best of all, they had a bike that I used to explore Amsterdam. Highly, highly recommended!!"
16846094,nice quite location. Super nice small Place.  I think is good to go with 3 Persons or a family with 1 child!
16856333,"lovely room in a nice apartment - it was most definitely was not, room consisted of a bed (unmade when we arrived) a chest of drawers that were not empty, no where to put your belongings apart from the floor which was of a limited space as there was a very large flat screen TV on top of the chest of drawers. The only use for the TV was to drape our damp towell's over it to dry!! You can have better facilities in a Hostel. The whole apartment was cluttered, untidy and not very clean."
16856490,"L'esperienza in casa di Fenno è stata perfetta, l'appartamento è molto bello in termini di confort, arredamento e servizi (finanche netflix) ed ha una posizione ottimale.<br/>Il mio voto è 10+"
16895210,"Perfect location in Amsterdam! Away from the hustle and bustle of Centraal but close to everything - great bars, restaurants and shopping lanes in a hip area. Corina's place was exactly as described, very comfortable and well appointed, especially that shower! Corina was a gracious host with great communication and gave us an excellent dining recommendation. "
16918097,"Très belle expérience chez Marga, hôte souriante, accueillante et généreuse. La petite maison de jardin était telle qu'elle était décrite et très chaleureuse. Marga est toujours disponible pour nous donner des conseils et nous aider à passer un bon séjour dans son pays.<br/>Nous avons beaucoup aimé le petit déjeuner partagé avec Marga, dans sa jolie houseboat, ce fut un moment convivial.<br/>Nous reviendrons avec plaisir, au printemps ou en été, pour quelques jours de plus !"
16939474,"Beautiful tranquil peaceful abode offering the perfect escapism and sanctuary. Stylishly decorated and completely private. Mike has went out of his way to ensure you have everything you could possibly need during your stay. From the fresh flower in the room to the fluffy towels, coffee machine and comfortable bed. Perfect location right on the park and in easy walking distance to everything. Close to tram stops taking you in various directions. Mike held our bags for us after check out which was really helpful. We loved it. "
16953310,"Edwin was a great host! I felt very welcome in his home. The room was nice and the bed was comfortable. The neighborhood was nice as well. There were a lot of restaurants and shops, and it was walking distance from everywhere I could think to go. "
17025785,"Андреа очень приветливая хозяйка, предоставляет сервис на уровне гостиничного. Большое количество полотенец, халаты и тапочки были очень приятным сюрпризом. Комната просторная, дом расположен очень близко к метро, удобно добираться до центра."
17059152,Kate's apartment is in a great location! Close to everything! We didn't even use the tram system we were able to walk everywhere. Very quiet at night. Although the stairs are very steep and there are a lot of them (4th floor) I would recommend. Not a good idea to bring big luggage. We used backpacks and they were perfect. Thanks Kate!
17084530,me and my wife stood in amsterdam for just 3 days and we picked the right place to stay. Laura and Arjan are amazing people and great family. They treated us like if we were family and if we needed anything or info all we had to do was ask. The apartment is in a fabolous location and close to everything we wanted to check out. They gave us wonderful breakfast every morning with great coffee. They even gave us a tour on a boat around the canal rings which was fantastic. We didnt know what to expect from Amsterdam but we fell in love with it and will plan a future visit again to this awsome city. I highly recomend this place to anyone visiting this great city and all it has to offer. I will deff be telling friends and family to stay here if ever coming. Hope to see you great people again. Thanks for everything
17101658,"The location is the best. We loved indische buurt, 20 min walking distance to the city center. Richard was a nice host even though we didn't saw him that much. The room itself is very small. We were three persons for 5 days, and there where no place to out your luggage. Also got very hot since you couldnt open the Windows. The bathroom was renovated and reaaaally great. No access to the kitchen was a disappointment. I would recomend it for a shorter stay and maximum 2 persons! Cheers"
17109145,Our stay at Corina's place was very nice. Its the only room on the downstairs portion of the house. The entry hall is shared and then there is a private room with bathroom attached. It was well appointed and got lots of natural light from the windows to the garden. Corina was very helpful and gave us good advice of things to see in Amsterdam.
17112336,"Unser Aufenthalt in Amsterdam war super. <br/>Sjoukje ist eine sehr freundliche und offene Person, sie hatte viele tolle Tipps und Informationen für uns. <br/>Wir würden jederzeit wieder bei ihr nächtigen :)"
17144728,"Wow, what a stay we had with Matthijs and Francina! Our two nights were magnificent, thanks most to our wonderful hosts! Matthijs greeted us as warmly as you could ask for and spend - no exaggeration - probably 20 minutes talking to us about the city and activities we might be interested in. In fact we never would have found our favorite place (Wynand Focking, a local distillery of Dutch spirits) had he not specifically pointed us there!<br/><br/>The location is ideal as can be; we walked everywhere but there is a bike rental place not more than a two minute walk from Rust. The room is lovely, overlooking a small side street in an entertaining, busy area. We had no problems with noise, however, because the large windows are quite effective. The bathroom is luxurious, similar to a very nice hotel, though toiletries were not provided (no problem for us but it would truly feel like a spa if it had one or two tiny amenities upgrades!). Moreover, that might allow these folks to finally start charging a reasonable rate - this room/place/staff is hands-down the biggest bargain in the city!<br/><br/>Cannot recommend this place - and people - highly enough! We won’t stay anywhere else in the city the next time we visit.<br/>"
17145369,"We all enjoyed 5 lovely days in your nice apartment.<br/>The apartment fully matched the description; both when it comes to the apartment as well as the location. Taking care of your two lovely cats was just a bonus on top of the holiday experience and made the stay even more personal.<br/>The location and neighborhood was PERFECT. Quite and nice surroundings. 25 meters to Café Forno (and though no noise), 50 meters to the baker, 50 meters to the Tram, 100 meters to Albert Hejn and last but definately not least: only 150 meters to Vondel Park.<br/>Thanks for your trust, letting us into your personal home - and some perfect days in Amsterdam :o)"
17152954,Delightful host who was so helpful when we had a problem. Fantastic position being quiet yet in the centre. Delicious breakfasts. Very comfortable room which was immaculately clean. Prompt correspondence from David with the clearest directions we have ever received to get to anywhere. In short - excellent - we can't think of anything to improve David's b&b or our experience. We hope to return.   
17162814,"Cecile offered a wonderful flat, which had some really great features. Upon arrival, she showed and explained everything about the flat, giving a homely feel. She also helped in giving maps and useful information.<br/>The flat was easily commuted by tram or bus, with local shops a short walk away.<br/>Staying in a flat like this really contributed to feel of Amsterdam, and would highly recommend to all!"
17164655,"We had a wonderful vacation at Corina's and we felt like home. The house is located on a perfet location, Just next to the nine streets area. Corina is extreemly kind and helpful. We also liked the very closed by Restaurant het stuivertje (sounds like staiferche) and Brasserie Blaze."
17229063,We had a great time staying in Nabila's studio. It was very clean and had everything we needed. We had a wonderful time in Amsterdam and were only a 3 minute drive to the train station. The studio has a great space and garden. We really appreciated how attentive Nabila was with us (thank you for the honey! And my son loved meeting your son!) and the advice she gave of places to visit in Amsterdam. She is very sweet and we would stay here again.
17235845,"Was in town on business and was able to book this place on short notice.   I had an absolutely wonderful stay.   The room was quite large and the location is immaculately clean.   laura and her husband we the best of host,  checking in multiple times to make sure everything was OK and even bringing down lovely breakfast basked in the morning. I can't recommend this place enough.  Would give it 6 stars if I could. "
17237650,The flat is really lovely. Lidia and Jean-Paul gave me a warm welcome when I arrived. Everything was nice and clean. The flat is located in a great area. Very central and also very close to a nice park. The hosts provided us with clean towels and there was even tea and coffees available. I would definitely stay here again!
17246875,"Lovely house and cute little garden. The neighbourhood is nicely located, easy access. We had a great time there.<br/>"
17284215,"Great location, the house was very cozy, big and very nice! Dewi and his husband were very kind and helpful! The best choice we could have done"
17290320,"We absolutely loved the home and it exceeded our expectations. Perfect for families with children. Just a wonderful place to stay in Amsterdam, the location could not be better. Walking distance to everything, but quite area in an amazing neighborhood. Would book again next time we are in town."
17294088,"Malgré notre arrivée tardive, tout était organisée pour nous faciliter l'accès à la chambre dans les meilleures conditions. Impossible de ne pas trouver facilement avec ses très bonnes explications! David est très accueillant et aidant. La chambre est telle que décrite, spacieuse, lumineuse et spacieuse. Très bon séjour!"
17308234,"The host was great and very helpful. There is a free ferry that goes to the City Centre which is very helpful. The ferries run every 15 minutes or so. However they stop at midnight and don't start until 7am. So if you have an early flight, make sure to organize a way to the airport. The room was great. Definitely recommend this accommodation if you don't want to be in the busy city centre. Enjoy your trip! "
17339973,"Situé dans un quartier calme aux portes du centre d’Amsterdam, cet appartement est très propre et idéal pour découvrir  le coin. Nous n'avons pas eu la chance de passer beaucoup de temps avec nos hôtes qui ont tout de même l'air très sympa mais un peu radins (deux capsules de déca et c'est tout). <br/>Deux gros bémols pendant notre séjour: <br/>-Il est indiqué dans l'annonce qu'il y un sauna mais pas que ce dernier engendre un coût de 50€ par utilisation<br/>-Sur l'annonce le lit apparaît comme un lit double agréable et spacieux, en tant que jeunes mariés nous avons été plus que déçu de découvrir qu'en réalité le logement est équipé de deux matelas simples et deux couettes simple encore.<br/><br/>Merci à Rene et Ellen pour avoir confirmé notre réservation de dernière minutes, notre avis global sur ce logement est moyen vis à vis du prix et nous ne réitérerons pas l’expérience."
17347441,"Hosts were very accessible and helpful before the visit, and Robert met us at the apartment when we arrived in Amsterdam to give us the keys and an overview of the apartment/neighborhood. Very gracious hosts who checked up on us during our stay. Apartment was comfortable, well located, and well maintained. We would stay again. "
17375310,"Hey Emma, our stay in your unique and stylish apartment was great! Everything went well.....a BIG Thank to Maaike for letting me in!"
17381360,"David was a super host! First off, the location was great--- right in the center of the Red Light District and truly a 5 minute walk to Amsterdam Centraal.  We had heavy suitcases and had no problem walking to David's. We also were able to easily walk around Amsterdam from his location.  The accommodations were great as well- David runs his location as a Bed and breakfast and we were afforded with a great balance of privacy and helpfulness. It was nice having a private bathroom right in our room. Shampoo/soap/towels/ and a hairdryer were all available. David delivered a breakfast basket every morning that kept us full until lunch time.  He even had a hot pot to boil water to make instant coffee (He provided the instant coffee as well).  The location is clean and well-kept. We would stay here again in a heartbeat."
17393102,"Séjour très décevant: <br/>-chambre spartiate et en mauvais état; <br/>-petit déjeuner non servi le premier jour et très limité les autres jours (pain de mie encore surgelé, œufs durs et barquette de charcuterie encore sous cellophane) ; <br/>-accueil froid et aucun échange et pas d'au revoir le jour du départ. <br/>Nous ne sommes peut-être pas venus au bon moment, dommage.<br/>"
17393605,Hein's apartment is exactly as described and very cosy. Hein is very passionate about his wonderful city and he very kindly gave us some great advice on where to go in the city. I would definitely recommend staying with Hein. Thanks Hein!
17402039,"Sally was such a wonderful host! The flat was immaculate and in a great part of town, far away from the noise yet very close to everything. Everything you need is within a 5 minute walk and Sally had some great recommendations."
17410927,"We've had a great time in Amsterdam staying at Sjoukje's place - she's welcoming, helpful and fun to talk to. The apartment is just as described - nice and clean, and you can get pretty much anywhere within 15-20 minutes on foot. Naz the cat is adorable, too! All in all, a great listing. "
17414962,Juul is very friendly. He answered every question in advanced and was very helpful. <br/>The houseboat is lovely and nice decorated. It's close to the city center but not in the middle of the city trouble. You have everything you need. We had a great time in Amsterdam and enjoyed our evenings on the terrace. Thank you!
17418749,"Great flat, great location. Host was very friendly and invited me to share living space with her and her friends. Also gave me advice on places to go and events on in the city while I was there, even helped me to book train tickets over the phone!"
17443916,"Hi, super sejour, on etait 4 personnes, beaucoup d'espace, bel appartement, a 25 min du centre a pied ou en bus (3 arrets..!), ou meme le taxi ( partant de central station -> 23€)..! <br/>Tres bon accueil, et facilite pour ce garer. Adresse a tenir dans son carnet d'adresse.! Merci beaucoup"
17449539,Sjoukje was a very nice and funny host. After our arrival in her flat she told us restaurants where we could eat dinner and told us which tram we should take to get there. We had a nice talk and a glass of wine with Sjoukje and her friend. The two ladies had many ideas what we could do during our stay in Amsterdam. 
17468641,"Thank you for being an excellent host and very welcoming. The room was lovely, within a traditional tall building with great views. Thank you for your very helpful advice before and during our stay. We really enjoyed it! The location is great with local breakfast cafes and bars around the corner, plus it take no time at all to get in the centre by tram."
17496083,"Anna and Marnix's apartment was amazing! Simply amazing!  The move in/out was super easy.  The apartment is even bigger than the pictures show.  Our group of 6 had plenty of space to sleep and hang out.  The grocery store right down the street combined with the kitchen resulted in some cheap and delicious meals.  The free fairy made traveling across the river to central Amsterdam very easy and quick.  If I ever come back to Amsterdam with a group, I will definitely stay here again!"
17519971,"Room was clean and bright (no balcony though). Location was not exactly central, but it is no more than a 20min tram or 20€ taxi trip away. Daniella was friendly and even sent me back some books I forgot at hey place. THX!! And did I speak about the bathroom: awesome!"
17526948,"Great location, and host Bart accommodating. But very small space, and the bed is not a king but two twins."
17528969,Amsterdam was awesome!! Everything was exactly as advertised in the description and pictures. It is located near the trolley so getting sound as no problem but go by bike if you have time. Over all we had s great time and would 100% stay with her again.
17532171,Thanks for Mr. David's warm hospitality. We enjoyed our stay here. The room is clean and tidy. It is the perfect location to stay in Amsterdam. We felt here as if at home. I highly recommend this B&B to all.
17562945,Hetty è un'ospite gentile e disponibile. Il quartiere è tranquillo e la posizione è comoda per raggiungere il centro sia a piedi che con i mezzi.
17571596,"The listing description was bang on accurate and we felt very comfortable walking around the neighbourhood both during the day and evening.  We loved the location as it allowed us to walk everywhere.  <br/>Maria was a fantastic host.  She was very friendly and made us feel welcome.  She even printed off maps of Amsterdam for us.<br/>Breakfast was more than we expected with a great assortment of items.<br/>We would definitely stay with Maria again."
17575801,"We really enjoyed our stay at Michas place! It's a spacious apartment in a nice & quiet area of Amsterdam and offers everything you need. You can reach the city center easily by metro. Micha is a really nice host, i can just recommend you to stay at his place when you are in Amsterdam! "
17585058,"Excellent place to stay: central, quiet and very cozy --"
17606670,"Mirjam is a very nice, friendly and helpful host. Whenever I needed to ask anything, she was eager to help me out.<br/><br/>The room was very cosy and even more quiet than I would expect, since it's so central! It is very close to Nieuwmarkt which has some good bars and cafés. I really needed a quiet environment to do some work on the road and I had 4-5 hours of complete focus in the mornings and got a lot of work done in that time! So for me this was perfect!"
17606710,"Clean and neatly designed room in a very peaceful neighbourhood. Tram stop is right outside the building and it takes a 15 minutes tram ride to arrive at Central Station, you can also try walking or renting bikes. Our hosts were very helpful, hinting us about some lesser known locations. Lovely international couple, best way to experience Amsterdam!"
17608927,"Matthijs welcomed me with a great smile and took time to explain everything and answer my questions. He also recommended a great Thai food place. Follow his advise, you won't be disappointed! The place is cozy and right in the heart of the Red Light District."
17609942,"We had the most wonderful stay in Emma's apartment! The apartment itself was so beautiful, and though I had made an error with some phone number, a friend of hers was really nice and met us right away. Emma provided us with lots of great tips, which made our Amsterdam experience even better. I really do not have anything else to say than that we had the most perfect stay."
17610508,"Before we left on our trip we were told that a friend was going to be at the apartment to let us in, but when we arrived nobody was there.  I had to go to a local coffee shop to use the wifi to find out where the key was left for us to let ourselves in, so that was a bit of a pain after travelling for 11 hours.  The place was pretty much as advertised.  The kitchen was not clean at all and the bathroom didn't have working lights so we were using tiny push lights to be able to see in the bathroom.  Our host was up quite late at night with friends over and talking on the phone the first night we were there which wasn't very easy for us to sleep.  We understand she had been away and had just returned, but would have expected that the place would have been cleaned at least and it was quite inconvenient to have no bathroom lights for two days.  The location is convenient however.  "
17631101," Rosie was a very friendly host whose apartment was bright and clean and in a great location. Rosie not only assisted us with information,but also shared her local knowledge about Amsterdam. Rosie took the time to make us feel very welcome and we really enjoyed our stay at her apartment."
17633074,"The room is exactly as listed and very comfortable - a real bonus in Amsterdam to have no stairs and a lovely garden space. It is ensuite so it really feels like your own little apartment. Although right in the centre of all the Jordaan action, it is quiet and peaceful, just the place for relaxation with easy access to the many attractions of Amsterdam.<br/>I really felt 'at home' here. Corina was welcoming and helpful and made me feel just like a 'friend' guest while allowing me space and privacy to enjoy my time - no stress, no problems.<br/>Just a wonderful break!"
17640712,"We really enjoyed our stay at Fenno's house. Very welcoming, comfortable and hassle-free. Just what we wanted for a relaxing weekend in Amsterdam. Fenno was very helpful in terms of tips for local attractions, lonely planet guides etc and we enjoyed the local area very much with nice cafes and a weekend market. Great!"
17666852,Andrea was a very nice host. She is always looking for your wellbeing and helps you with all your questions you have. The room was very comfortable and has everything you need. All in all a very good airbnb experience. Would recommend it for everyone who wants to visit Amsterdam! 
17672836,"We rent Karen's apartment  to extend your stay in Amsterdam.<br/>The apartment is located in a very safe district at distance of the ""commercial bad side"" of Amsterdam- it is very  clean and as pictured.<br/>you find very close all commodities you need included tramway number  5 and 16. We have a great communication with Karen she really cares about how feel her guests. I will recommend this apartment without any reserve just take care of the steep stairs;"
17702030,"We were a group of 5 adults and stayed on Merlijn's houseboat for three nights. It was a great experience and we enjoyed it very much. We stayed there in December when it was pretty cold, and we were slightly worried that the cold river might cool the boat quite significantly. However, the heating was totally great and we did not have to freeze at all.<br/>The bathroom was fairly basic and probably not for the posh or spoilt types, but is was ok for us. It just takes a bit of organisation to get / keep everything dry after a shower.<br/>The only criticism would be that the guest room bed was really not suitable for an adult, because the distance between the walls was really to narrow so one would be lying in bed with the feet ""standing"" on the wall. Also, the floor on which the mattress lied was not flat, so we really couldn't sleep deeply in that bed, and we resorted to moving the mattress to the living room to find a flat stretch of floor. Ultimately, the guest room should not be advertised as an adult room after all, I guess.<br/>Overall it was a great experience, the boat was located at a convenient spot and Merlijn was a great host, who was very very friendly with all of his communications. It was a real pleasure to have stayed on his boat and I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind be a little bit less comfort than a typical hotel room."
17704523,"Very convenient location – very easy to get to the city center by tram or even just walking. The room itself was very cozy and clean. I suggest renting a bike, it is really convenient way of exploring Amsterdam. In general – I recommend staying at Rosie's place, she is very helpful and interesting person."
17723124,"We were with Barbara for 4 days at the end of the July. She was an incredibly accommodating host with an absolutely beautiful apartment.<br/><br/>Tucked away in a gorgeous part of the city, bars, clubs, restaurants and sights were all easily accessible on foot. It was the perfect size for the 3 of us but would easily accomodate 4, with a charming little garden a perfect setting for an en evening meal.<br/><br/>The apartment is light, tidy and spacious. It meant that when the weather was less nice, we were more than entertained and happy to stay indoors. We also could cook and eat comfortably making it the perfect place for us to stay.<br/><br/>Most importantly though, Barbara was just a fantastic host. If there are 2-4 of you, this is where you should stay."
17769016,"Wilbert is a very friendly and courteous person, he answered all of our questions we have had before our trip and took some of his time to introduce us to everything that was necessary during our stay.<br/>We were allowed to deposit our luggage before we could check into our room and before we left a'dam we have claimed that opportunity for depositing all of our stuff again - so it is really uncomplicated to organize if your flight lands/takes off earlier/later whereas you can check in/check out of the accommodation. <br/>The lodging by the way was tidy, well heated, spacious and very light.<br/>The shower and toilet have got a well chosen, modern design. <br/>Especially with the shower we fell in love because it offers such a wonderful opportunity to calm you down after a busy day or energizes you for a day in this colorful city. <br/>We would definitely book Wilbert's guest room a second time!! :) <br/>Check it out yourself and enjoy a wonderful, unique time in Holland's capital city - cheers! <br/>Mike & Julie"
17771052,Edwin was a great host. He was very helpful giving directions on how to get to the apartment and when I got there made me feel completely at home. He also gave me great recommendations on food and different sight seeing and tourist attractions. The location of the apartment is great too. Can be a little noisy at night but I had no problem falling asleep. I would definitely stay here again.
17798231,"This is a nice place to stay, very homelike. The room is exactly as shown in the photos, and the shared bath is new, neat, and spotlessly clean. The apartment is located in a nice bit of Amsterdam, very convenient to downtown, attractions such as the museum complex, and especially to the bit RAI conference centre.<br/><br/>I had to leave early each morning during my stay, so I didn't breakfast with the hosts, but the family were all friendly and welcoming. Nice place, nice people."
17829797,"Me and my partner have just come back from the Vondel Guest House in Amsterdam and we can safely say we have had a lovely stay with Wilbert & Shayna. Both were very friendly and helpful. The guest room was clean and just what we needed - the bathroom and shower room were also lovely and beautifully designed. Bruce the cat was also very friendly! The Vondel House was well placed been only a 10 minute walk from the ""Leidseplein"". Me and Mike were both very impressed with how helpful Wilbert was - he printed our boarding passes for our flight home & also emailed us links for what was going on in Amsterdam during our stay. Really went out his way to make our stay easy and relaxing. Fully recommend The Vondel House and Wilbert for anyone wishing to explore Amsterdam, such a beautiful city which you can get lost in, friendly and relaxing! "
17846406,"Ton was very responsive and helpful to me in finding his place and making suggestions of where to go. His home is in a decent area, but need to take the train to get to restaurants/cafes, etc. His dog is adorable and the breakfast was lovely. "
17872408,"We stayed for 4 nights. The place is located on a beautiful alley with all kind of shops and a couple of great restaurants. 20 minutes by foot to most of the attractions. We fell in love with the place and it was very hard to leave)<br/>Corina was a wonderful host! Very kind. Quickly responded to all our questions and helped us to make the best of our stay. <br/>Thank you, Corina! "
17877141,"Our stay at Nathalie's was perfect! The place is lovely, clean and fully furnished. The location is also very good. The neighborbood is quiet comparing to some other touristic areas where all other hotels are."
17887125,"The apartment was lovely, clean and quiet. We had back bedroom and the main room (shown in the primary picture) pretty much to ourselves. S was very helpful and friendly, which was great because our train was delayed and we arrive after 10pm. Place is close to the center of town, just 2 blocks from train line. Bed was REALLY comfortable. This place was charming and lovely. Here are a couple of details I think people should know:<br/>1. The stairs are very very steep, though I think this is common in most houses in Amsterdam. They would certainly present a challenge for some people. <br/>2. The layout of the house is this: there are 2 bedrooms upstairs, as well as a very large bathroom with a tub, and separate small water closet. All of these rooms connect to a hallway which is open to the downstairs where Sem lives. It didn't feel private, even though I knew Sem was perfectly respectful. Some people like to walk around their house naked. Sue me.<br/>3. The location is GREAT. A very short walk from so many great sites to see.<br/>4. There were some noises from both above and below at times, and sometimes past midnight.<br/>5. Sem was a good communicator at first, but didn't reply to several of my messages during my stay. Others have listed him as a great communicator, so perhaps it was just a busy week for him.<br/>6. The shower lacks a shower curtain, and thus water spreads everywhere. This makes it challenging for multiple to use the bathroom after someone takes a shower.<br/>7. If you are visiting in the warm months, only one of the two rooms has an air conditioner, and it's a portable unit, right next to the bed, with no dedicated vent to the outside. <br/>Though this might all sound critical, we really had a lovely stay and very much appreciated the charm of this place. If you need a two bedroom place in AMS, I would highly recommend it."
17888832,"Great apartment! Vibeke is a very kind host and a really nice person. She tells us what to see and where to go... she helped us for everything! <br/><br/>Very cozy apartment and a convenient neighborhood too. Very simple to reach from the Central Station and connected with many trams and buses. One day we reached the city centre walking (with a bike would be perfect!)<br/><br/>We loved her cats too... so we think it is a perfect accomodation.<br/><br/>Francesco & Veronica "
17903992,"The home was large, comforatbela dn very neat and clean. It was a children's paradise with a nice backyard, some toys and of course the bedding arrangements fed their imaginations!<br/><br/>The kitchen is amazingly large, and fully equipped which was wonderful however I didn't get much time to cook.<br/><br/>The bedding was clean and comfortable.<br/><br/>Joris was a very kind host and always responded to queries. It was an organised drop off key system which made it easy having 3 kids to manage. <br/><br/>Location: Amazing location and being a one way street meant less traffic. We had brilliant bakeries around us which was quite nice and not to mention everything else that we did. We hired bikes and rode around town and found the house to be central to almost everything. <br/><br/>You can;t go wrong booking this place. Thanks Joris and family for a wonderful stay.<br/><br/>Maysaa & fam."
17908735,"Staying with Rosie and Matt was like being with a family away from home. They were wonderful hosts with good knowledge of things to see and do, in the city or the countryside. It was good sharing breakfast and many stories about their lives in The Netherlands. <br/><br/>Would certainly recommend them as awesome hosts and their apartment is in a lovely quiet neighbourhood with easy access to the city and train to the airport. <br/><br/>Thanks for a wonderful stay!!!"
17918743,"Marijke was e really nice host! alltough she wasn't home the first 2 days, everything was perfectly prepared and clean. We met her the last day when she came home fromher holidays. She's a absolutly agreable person, would book again!"
17935924,Our stay at David's was great! The place looks like in the pictures and it's very clean and tidy. The place is near the station and easily reachable from the city. I recommend this place if you are going to Amsterdam!
17949441,"We were made very welcome in this lovely apartment, perfectly situated for the city and easy travel to other places. Roel is the perfect host, giving excellent information and making us feel immediately at home. As a result we had a great time and had the best possible base to explore the city and the country."
17977584,"A beautiful home in the best area of Amsterdam. Using AIRBNB for our first time I stayed here with my wife baby and dog and was very happy with the house of Godelieve and her host Barbara. Thank you for a great week, w'll be back!"
18010751,"La ubicacion esta bien, es un barrio tranquilo y bien comunicado con tiendas y restaurantes. La casa es moderna y muy agradable y la anfitriona acogedora.<br/>La habitacion tiene nevera y calentador de agua, vasos y tazas. Pero el acceso a la cocina es restingido."
18017639,"It was a great experience staying at Harry and Anna´s  houseboat. All pictures were really close to reality, and they make all very easy to stay at their place. Only issue we had was that they notify us really close to our arrival that they would be away for the time we were at their house. We had to perform international calls to their mother (responsible to the house during this time and who did not respond promptly) to fix the internet, which was only working properly again after 3rd day. Also there is only one bathroom in the house, which is in the middle of both rooms separated by thin walls, so when someone is using the shower it is very noisy in the other room. If you have to wake up too long before the other room, this may be a problem, as you wake up everyone."
18022344,Your place is perfect. My nieces couldn't stop talking about how cute it is. Thank you so much for hosting. You are a delight and thank you for the recommendations. 
18038819,"Accueil et contact plutôt sympathiques appartement confortable pas très loin du centre.<br/>Toutefois le frigidaire, four et micro onde étaient sales, et beaucoup de cheveux disséminés un peu partout, notamment dans les serviettes et les couverts.<br/>Il est demandé de laisser l'appartement propre donc nous avons fait le ménage et de jeter le sac poubelle,  dans le même temps 30 euros de frais de ménage sont facturés donc il y a une incohérence.<br/>Plutôt correct dans l'ensemble."
18054574,"Good environment, not far away from city central, and most importantly, Jo is very very friendly!"
18074117,Karlijn was a wonderful hostess and we really enjoyed our stay! We could not have asked for a better reception and communication - Karlijn was so helpful and kind.  And the apartment was beautiful- spacious and very clean with a comfortable bed. And the location was perfect. Karlijn left us some snacks which were delicious. Thank you for a lovely stay!
18093705,Excelente anfitrión!!!! El departamento muy cómodo y estetico!! Heinz no dudó ni un segundo en hacernos sentir de la mejor manera! Muchísimas gracias!!
18099986,"Joke was great!! I had a really great experience all around with this Airbnb. Joke is a natural hostess and was very welcoming and accommodating. The breakfast was super yummy - something different every morning! And she had a lot of good tips about getting around.<br/><br/>The room is nice - just as pictured. I stayed in that neighborhood because I had friends staying nearby for a conference. It's really easy to get downtown, and there is a cheap bike rental place in the square right by her place. I definitely recommend this place! "
18143320,"Fué muy amable, me vino a buscar a la estación y todo estaba muy preparado"
18167438,"Like the other reviewers have said, great apartment, fabulous location, fully equipped, strong wifi, wonderful shower and bed. But best of all, a caring and thoughtful host in Nicolet. Love that she left lots of information about the apartment and the neighborhood. And to top it all off, after we left we realized that we had left a valuable item behind and she is arranging to ship it home to us. This was our first Airbnb experience and we could not be more pleased.<br/>BTW, we were slightly apprehensive about the ceilings being low from other reviews. My husband and are are both 5'10"" and it was never an issue, didn't even notice it."
18259544,"Simone is a fabulous host! She's so lovely, cheerful, and easy to get along with!! I enjoyed every moment with her. I had a wonderful time in Amsterdam not only because the city itself is beautiful, but also because of the superb experience to stay in Simone's house. Her lovely house is a 10-15 minutes walk from the metro station. Walking through the neighbourhood and the park is a relaxing time i'll never forget. Getting to the central station is as simple as eating a pie. I love everything about Simone and her house, also her two lovely and beautiful dogs. I just hope i could have more time spending with her. She's the kind of person who you'll love once you start a conversation with her. And i'm so impressed that she's taking pictures for all her airbnb guests. It's no doubt one of my best experiences in airbnb. I love you Simone! Hope to see you again in future!!"
18270744,"Excelente apartamento, acogedor, limpio y recogido. La amfitriona no estaba en casa esos días y nos dejo instrucciones, consejos y observaciones muy detalladas de como estar en su casa. Muy atenta en asegurarse que todo iba bien y que conocíamos el funcionamiento de todo.<br/>Tiene un gato encantador que nos ha enamorado! Es muy dócil y cariñoso.<br/>Bastante bien situado! En unos 20 min. andando estábamos en el centro.<br/>Muy recomendable"
18279632,Die Lage des Hausbootes ist super. Nur eine Station vom Museumsplein entfernt und zum Hauptbahnhof sind es auch nur 15 min. Michele ist sehr unkompliziert. Man muss einfach mal auf einem Hausboot übernachtet haben. Tolle Erfahrung. Vielen Dank dafür. Würde es jeder Zeit wieder buchen. Das einzige was uns gefehlt hat war ein Spiegel. Sonst alles top. 
18285366,"A very nice trip ! Toetsie was perfect, the place was very comfortable and I feeled like home, Casa Vrolik miss me.. It was really great, not far from Amsterdam Centraal and near a great Coffeeshop, absolutely perfect for me, Toetsie, keep the good work !"
18294609,It was amazing!
18331569,nice place for me : easy to go to Rai exhibition and easy when arriving with Thalys! Absolument parfait. Couple sympathique avec qui nous avons eu des discussions amicales. Le petit déjeuner et la chambre sont préparés avec plus de soins que dans un hôtel de luxe et c'était excellent. Le lieu prés d'un canal sans touriste est aussi un endroit plus qu'appréciable.
18341771,"The apartment was great with direct access to the garden. Vibeke was a very kind host and really nice. She helped us with everything and gave us tips where to go! <br/>We had a great time there - thank you very much!"
18387409,"The apartment was greart! Just like it was described by Marijke in the Air BNB website. The apartment location was extremely central and easy to find. Marijke did her best to make us feel comfortable! Beside a lovely apartment, we got to meet an amazingly talented, loving and interesting woman!!! "
18471649,"WARNING: The review below contains nothing but glowing praise for Heleen's apartment.<br/><br/>Our family of four had the pleasure of staying at Heleen's apartment on our recent trip to Amsterdam. Prior to our arrival, Heleen was very responsive and helpful.<br/><br/>Heleen was waiting for us at the apartment when we arrived and we enjoyed chatting with her as she showed us around the apartment and made some recommendations about the city. She had some delicious welcome treats for us and even dropped off a fresh box of hagelslag for our children to enjoy on their breakfast toast :) She encouraged us to make ourselves at home and to use whatever we wanted in the kitchen.<br/><br/>Heleen's apartment is located on a calm and quiet street, but is around the corner from great restaurants, markets and shops, as well as a quarter-block from the Amstel River. The apartment looks just as it does in the photos and is so beautiful! The apartment is flooded with natural light with charming art and decorative details throughout (I loved the lighting in the separate toilet and the coat rack in the entry). If I were to live in Amsterdam, I would love to have an apartment like Heleen's.<br/><br/>The apartment is very comfortable and well-equipped with a great bathroom, kitchen, washer/dryer, and fast WiFi. It was very easy for us to get to the apartment on the tram.<br/><br/>Overall, Heleen is a wonderful host and her apartment is a wonderful place to stay -- I hope to have the opportunity to stay again!<br/>"
18478996,"Schon vor Beginn der Reise, war die Kommunikation mit den Gastgebern sehr unkompliziert und freundlich. Inger hat sich ganz nach unseren An-und Abreisewünschen gerichtet und uns sehr nett empfangen. Das Haus entsprach genau den Bildern und war mit frischen Blumen dekoriert. Alles in allem hatten wir in diesem Objekt einen wunderschönen Aufenthalt und können es absolut weiterempfehlen. Unser nächster Trip nach Amsterdam wird auf jeden Fall wieder in diesem schönen Haus sein. "
18484780,"Nous avons passer un bon moment à Amsterdam et pour notre soirée supplémentaire, nous avons pu être répondu rapidement par Ruud ! Notre hôte nous as bien accueilli et nous avons réussi à bien nous arranger ensemble !<br/>The place was great but it's not a big place, we were 5 boys and it was just ok. I would suggest this place for a party of 2-3 or max 4 but for 5 person, the place is definitely too small. It was clean and the patio was very nice, it made our stay much better.<br/>Good place, good price and nice location in Amsterdam ! I recommend this place ! "
18489486,"David was a perfect host.  We very much appreciated his flexibility with our arrival time and request for early breakfast on the day we departed.  The room was spacious, bright, and exactly as depicted.  The location was great, and we enjoyed spending an afternoon just relaxing in our room with local treats, watching all the street life through the wonderful large windows.  The bathroom was clean, modern, and we were provided with plenty of fresh towels.  And the bed was super comfortable, too!  David had lots of brochures available so we could plan what we wanted to see and do.  This was our first AirBnB stay--we could not imagine having had a better experience.  Thanks, David!"
18508157,"The place was nice. Even though I couldn't see Jordis because of her journey, I didn't have any problem communication with her. I had a rental car and there was no free space for parking but I think it's the same condition almost everywhere in Amsterdam. Jordis left a warm greeting letter & some pictures for me. Her place is pretty close to Schiphol airport & Downtown."
18513776,"Very good communication with Christen, her friend greeted us well and explained us everything in the apartment. Everything was functional and easy access to the city center. A lot of space in the apartment. I recommend this apartment. "
18524720,The room was nice and clean it is in the center very close to all main attractions and to the Central station so it is very comfortable. David was very nice and welcome. Great place to stay!
18534984,"Zeer vriendelijke verhuurder. Huis is goed gelegen, dichtbij tram en supermarkt. De auto parkeren kan voor ongeveer 14 euro per dag op een nabijgelegen parking."
18550576,"That was a great stay and Jeroen is really awesome host. He recommended us much places around and we really enjoyed the journey. His place is very nice and I loved that huge window!<br/>I would totally recommend this place and I hope to get back there one day!"
18566681,"Nice flat  clean and well  decorated , very good location in Amsterdam in the heart of Jordaan .<br/>We were very happy  , except for  the Noisy Neighbors  who had a party Friday  night till 4AM !<br/> "
18569401,"Sehr nette und herzliche Gastgeber. Schlüsselübergabe ist reibungslos abgelaufen. Tolles Apartment, genau wie auf den Fotos! Insgesamt super zufrieden!!!"
18581016,"Fijn appartement van alle gemakken voorzien. Micha is heel vriendelijk en gastvrij. De locatie is perfect, vlakbij de Arena. In een rustige buurt, vlakbij een metrostation, vanuit daar ben je snel in het centrum van Amsterdam. Wij komen graag terug."
18617866,"Très bel apart, super emplacement suffisament proche du centre pour y accéder à pied en passant par le Vondelpark, et entouré de plusieurs bons restaurants et cafés pour connaitre l'ambiance locale d'Amsterdam un peu plus loin des coins à touristes. Les hôtes sont très sympa et  accueillants."
18629998,"In 1 woord fantastisch! Schoon, leuk en stijlvol modern ingericht. Hele leuke buurt; veilig en gezellig voor kinderen maar ook ben je heel makkelijk en snel in het centrum. Erg gezellige en goeie eettentjes op loopafstand. Bijzondere architectuur en waterrijke omgeving zorgen voor 'historisch maar mondain' gevoel. En last but not least, super lieve gastvrouw die echt in alles de puntjes op de i zet!"
18645385,"Top location, very nice host, taking care of requests immediately, def a place worth going"
18669002,"The announcement about the house and the lovley room is prefect...no surprise. The host Sjoukje was accommodating and kind, even before arriving, becouse i asked many thing about Amsterdam and new year's eve party and all times she responded quickly.<br/>The apartament is very easy to reach from the airport and the district is very quiet. To arrive at Dam's square from the house is not so far by walk 25/30 min but it's better to take tram, the stop it's only 100m far form the flat.<br/>We didn't spend much time at home or with Sjoukje because we were leaving in the morning and came back in the evening.<br/>Last but not the least...there is a king in the house...the cat!!! He is very lovley and looking for pampering."
18692885,"Robert and Anke are the kindest and most gracious hosts and the apartment was fantastic - clean, adorable, safe, bright, and close to all of the major sights in Amsterdam.  As hosts, they made themselves available for questions and recommendations about museums, restaurants, etc.  I had a fantastic trip in Amsterdam and look forward to returning for another visit. I would gladly stay in this apartment again. A real gem!"
18694616,"Very nice room, good location. Recommend it!"
18705762,We have just come back from a lovely few days stay at David's apartment. It was stunning here. The room was exactly how it was in all the pictures and it was right in the middle of everything in Amsterdam but that little bit away so you didn't get the noise from the street. We had a lovely stay and defiantly want to go back soon. I didn't get to meet david but his friend was very helpful showing us where things were. We had a lovely stay. Thank you for having us david :)  We stayed here 2 years ago after we got engaged and then came back for a mini moon. It's still as good as we remember perfect spot in Amsterdam and will come back soon. 
18706199,We were told it was a 5pm check-in but were very kindly told 4pm would be ok for us as we were arriving early.  Everything we needed was provided for. Property and all the towels and linen were very clean. The owner (only met Monique) was extremely welcoming and friendly and she let us have our privacy  even though the property is locationed as a studio flat to their home. Great location with a short (10 min) bus journey to central station. Would recommend. Thank you very much!!
18740163,"Toetsie was a wonderful host. Already from my initial contact with her here on the Airbnb website she was open, friendly and very helpful. We had fun conversations during my stay at Casa Vrolik and she helped me with directions etc. during my first days in Amsterdam. I stayed in the one person bedroom. The place is exactly as it is described (if not nicer!), clean, cosy, functional and ever so homely. Look out for the fabulous chandelier in the bathroom. :) It was great to have access to the little kitchenette and the cat Rokie is a gem, added bonus for cat lovers. All in all it was a wonderful stay. I truely believe I could not have had a better, more pleasant landing in Amsterdam than with my stay at Casa Vrolik! Thank you Toetsie!"
18749040,"How do I begin?? With one word ... Perfection! Wendy was the perfect host from start to finish! Unfortunately we did not get to meet you but the presecco and presents were unbelievable and what a gorgeous start to our weekend .. Anouk Wendy's friend meet us in her beautiful appartment , she was extremely helpful giving us tips of places to see, even booking our taxi for us to the airport on the last night xx  , Wendy had also left numerous books and information leaflets for us , highlighting all the best places !!!! Amazing !!! The apartment is in a great location in the de pijp area this area on it's own is full of fun shops bars and restaurants . The tram is a 1 min walk and takes your right to the city centre in ten mins .. All I can say is this apartment host and stay were flawless from start to finish and I will definAtely be coming back here as soon as possible . Fallen in love with Amsterdam x thanks Wendy and anouk . P.s the waffles were amazing too x love Tara and Noah "
18749259,"A very nice stay in Toetsie flat with a great welcome from the host. <br/>Everything is like pictures so no surprise ! <br/>Flat outside the city center in a very quiet area with all commodities around. <br/><br/>Toetsie will give you all the information you need to improve your Amsterdam experience. <br/>I recommend Toetsie for your trip :). "
18752347,It couldn't be better. Excellent localisation and Davis is the perfect host. Room is very clean and spacious. 
18758159,"Marieke was incredibly helpful and forthcoming with information that would help make our stay and journey a good one. A very attentive host who despite being abroad did everything within her power to help us; she provided a friendly contact who was welcomed us warmly. <br/><br/>The apartment itself was quaint and cosy with creative interior design which added to the magic of a wonderful visit. I strongly suggest to all those considering to book this beautiful apartment - you will not regret it! Also having two bikes to explore with was perfect. Thank you again Marieke, it truly was a pleasure x"
18792572,"The room was really nicely laid out with an interesting old desk and wardrobe. It wasn't that big of a room, but there was space for the two of us. I liked having the small fridge and Nespresso machine as well. The best part of it was the location - right next to a canal, and in the Oud west part of Amsterdam, so far enough away from the tourist center of town to be quieter but still close enough to get to all the tourist attractions. There was a really nice cafe/bar right next to the room with seating along the canal to sit outside and have drinks or food in the sunshine. The Vondelpark as well is a short walk away."
18813853,"Anne-Marie's flat is absolutely wonderful! The roof top terrace is cozy and private with a great view. The flat is very clean and stylish. Has everything u need. 2 blocks from the tram, 1 block to the supermarket. Just outside the city so it's nice n quiet but not too far if u want a crazy night in town. Patrick and Anne were very helpful hosts with tons of info on what to do and where to go. Prob one of my favorite places so far on air bnb. If u get the chance u must book this flat!! Or else hidden gems will slip between your fingers!! "
18817387,"The location was very beautiful, I would have loved to stayed longer. I stayed in Amsterdam just one night after a long conference in Belgium, my cousin flew down from Belfast to visit me and he too really enjoyed the houseboat. Anneke is a wonderful host, I just wish we had more time! <br/>Thanks Anneke, hope to see you again.  I wish there were 6 stars!! This was my third time staying with Anneke, it’s my first choice in Amsterdam. Very quiet location but still close to the action of Amsterdam Central. At night if you listen close you can hear the animals from the zoo across the canal. <br/>The home is very clean and Anneke is very hospitable. <br/>Thanks again Anneke, see you again."
18849507,"Hein is a nice and funny person (with the nicest bike in the world jejeje). He gave us a nice welcoming with a coffee and a map. He told us places to visit , the ones only a person who lives there knows.  The little studio was perfect for 2 people, quiet, close to the center, next to a good bakery and a supermarket. We will definately come back. Thank you Hein"
18851549,"I would not hesitate to recommend a stay a Marga's cosy place.  Her and her family are great people, very welcoming and friendly, and put themselves out to make sure you have an enjoyable stay.  They are genuinely interested to help you, and frankly cannot do too much to ensure you feel at home.  <br/>Do not worry about cold and wet weather outside if you stay at cold times - the house is extremely warm, and the family were kind enough to light the burner every evening before I arrived back at night.  The bathroom on the boat is spotlessly clean with plenty of hot water.  <br/>The general 'vibe' of the place is very calm and relaxing - I have not had such a good sleep at nights for years!<br/>I have been to Amsterdam a couple of times before, and was very pleased to have chosen this quieter location away from the city centre to stay in.  There is, incidentally, a large supermarket very close by on the way to the tram stop, which is extremely useful.  <br/>Overall, I would definitely stay again - provided she is not totally booked up!"
18874264,"Très bon accueil et très belle péniche. A faire ! The house is beautiful, really spacious, and Anita is very helpful."
18875024,"I had a very short, but great stay at Marga's and Rico's place. The guest house is super cozy and has a nice quirky feel to it. It's really quiet during the night and the house boat offers a delightful view on the water, it's like a little quiet oasis. Marga and Rico immediately makes you feel welcome so would definitely like to come back! "
18919201,"Ellen and her husband were excellent hosts, both helpful in providing information on things to do and to see. The picture of the room depicted is exactly like the real thing and getting there from Amsterdam Railway station was easy and regular."
18963316,"It was great in all aspects. Very good location , very nice little apartments with seprate entry and their own garden. There was quietly like in the village.<br/>And , of course,  we very liked hostess - Jo is very hospitable and charming.<br/>So, we do recommend this place for future visitors.<br/><br/><br/>"
18976513,"Marga was very warm and welcoming. She hosted me in her lovely guest house by her incredible house boat that she lives in. Breakfast was very nice as well. It was a shame we didn't get to talk more, as my schedule was very busy and she was a great guest."
18992291,"Very nice appartment in a nice and quiet area. Easy access to the city by metro or tram as well.<br/><br/>Host was always helpfull with tips up front and check-in. We had no issues during our stay that needed the attention of the host. "
19053728,Nada was lovely! She was very responsive and was even accommodating to letting us leave our bags at her apt early before check-in. She communicated with us even though she was traveling for work. The apartment was in a great area and was very clean. The rooftop was a pleasant touch! We had a fantastic stay in Amsterdam! 
19062092,"Nos 4 jours à Amsterdam ont été parfaits !! Et ce grâce au super accueil de Kasia. Notre hôte a été très flexible pour nos horaires d'arrivée et de départ. Quand nous sommes arrivées, Kasia nous a accordé du temps pour nous donner ses bonnes adresses et ses conseils. L'appartement est très sympa, propre et correspond bien à ce que l'on voit sur les photos. L'appartement se trouve un peu en recul du centre-ville mais c'est plutôt sympa de se trouver au calme, et le centre se rejoint en à peine 10 minutes de vélo et tramway (station juste à côté !).<br/>++ Un loueur de vélo très pratique à l'angle de la rue ! <br/>"
19068224,"Edwin was a great host. The house is very well located, the room is great and everything is clean. I advise everyone to stay at Edwin's house. I hope to return one day. Thank you so much."
19081144,"My mom was visiting Amsterdam, yet I didn't have enough space to host her in my place. So I booked Christopher's room for her. She was very happy in Christopher's place. She liked the nice and perfectly clean apartment, the very comfortable bed and Christopher's openness and hospitality. I also met Christopher and found him to be a really nice and welcoming host, friendly and easy to talk to, providing a lot of help and ideas what to see and do in the neighbourhood. Thanks, Christopher, for the good experience!"
19111341,Der Aufenthalt bei Ed war ganz wundervoll! Die Umgebung ist perfekt und sehr zentral...wir kommen bestimmt wieder! 
19149463,"Wilbert was a very nice and friendly host,we really enjoyed his acommodation-the room,the location and especially the bed!Definitely will come back to this great and special city & cozy acommodation.It's really close to the Schiphol."
19153154,"Daniella always responded to my questions though I never met her. The cleaning lady gave me the keys and waited extra for me as I arrived extra early. <br/>The room and bathroom is as advertised. 2 other groups were staying there too but it was enough space for all of us. Although there was a tv in the room it did not work as now channels could be received. This was a little downturn after a long congress day. <br/>The neighborhood is ok with trams and busses in front of the door. Bike rental is on the opposite of the street though you can not return the bikes on saturday evening or sundays. So renting bikes on weekend trips is not recommended. <br/>A nice bagel cafe (beans and bagels) is 100 m away which serves really great hummus bagels. I recommend that for breakfast to everyone. "
19175728,"Fenno was an awesome host! He had guide books and a map ready for us, marked out with his top picks for places to visit, restaurants, and general places to hang out. He even sent over a list of events going on when we told him we were thinking of going out clubbing. His apartment is beautiful, very clean, and easily accessible from the city center (about 15 minutes walking). We had a great stay, and would definitely recommend staying here if you're visiting Amsterdam. "
19225150,"Host was really welcoming, provided towels and free dutch biscuits. Room was really clean in a nice area. Is really close to the city centre, about 15 minutes walk and there are lots of really nice cafes to eat in close by. Really close to the anne frank house etc. Would definitely recommend staying here :)"
19233328,"Hans is very polite and wellcoming. The guesthouse is very tidy and has everything you need, including a fridge with drinks at good prices. The wifi is a bit complicated, since we could only connect one device at a time, but it worked fine. Great breakfast included. Small rooms, beds are ok. Thanks"
19246733,"Sehr gemütliches und ruhiges Zimmer. Jeroen haben wir leider nicht kennengelernt. Er hat sich aber sehr gut per E-Mail und SMS um uns gekümmert ;)<br/>Es gab die Möglichkeit 2 Fahrräder für 5 Euro pro Tag von ihm zu mieten. <br/>Amsterdam Nord ist wirklich super und mit der kostenlosen Fähre ist man auch schnell in der City.  "
19288616,"Nicht so toll. Michèle war nur so lange zuverlässig, bis wir nicht mehr stornieren konnten - das ist leider unser Eindruck. Erst dann teilte sie uns mit, dass sie am tag unserer Ankunft erst aus Ibiza zurückkommen würde. Ihr Flug hatte Verspätung und das Hausboot musste noch gereinigt werden. Um 18h konnten wir noch immer nicht rein. Es hieß es gibt freies Wlan, doch das funktionierte nicht. Auf meine sms bekam ich keine Rückmeldung, eine kurze Entschuldigung wäre nett gewesen. Die Unterkunft ist unseres Erachtens zu teuer. Es fehlt an Kleinigkeiten, wie einem Spiegel, Badvorleger oder einer kleinen Ablage für Duschgel. Wir werden sicher nicht nochmal wieder kommen."
19301181,"I stayed with Gina and Frans as part of a group of 4 visiting Amsterdam for the annual Amsterdam Marathon.  From the outset Gina was forthcoming and thoroughly helpful in assisting with our planning for the weekend.  She provided all the information that was asked for very quickly and provided some useful advice that helped us throughout our visit.  The accommodation was easy to find and readily accessible by either tram, train or taxi (16 euros from the town centre).<br/>The accommodation itself was just what was required as a base for exploring the city.  Simple, functional and comfortable.  The shower was particularly good and the wifi connection was excellent.  The provision of a few beers, some fruit and additional groceries was very much appreciated.  I would have no reservations with recommending this BnB to friends or family. The house and hosts are both great and I wish Gina and Frans all the best.<br/>Matt<br/>"
19374260,The flat is located in a really nice part of Amsterdam and is lovely! Pim was a really nice host and quite helpfull! And the wine and beer on arrival was really nice!
19375676,"Ik en mijn vriend hebben hier slechts enkele uurtjes doorgebracht, omdat we naar een ADE feestje gingen in Noord. Spontaan boden Marion en Jang hun fietsen aan, omdat we 's nachts anders een flink eind terug moesten lopen. Deze mensen hebben een hart van goud, wat niet alleen duidelijk wordt door hun gastvrijheid maar ook hun oprechte interesse. Daarnaast is er een heel mooie tuin en een luie en een ADHD-kat (de ADHD-kat was te moe van zijn eigen gedrag, dus hij zal je rust niet verstoren, haha). Het bed ligt heerlijk en de omgeving, Amsterdam-Noord, is een aantrekkelijke mix van industrieel gebied en dorpse gezelligheid. Ik vermoed dat dit deel van Amsterdam de komende jaren een grote ontwikkeling zal doormaken, dus daarom alleen al is het de moeite waard om hier te verblijven. Marion & Jang, nogmaals van harte bedankt. We komen graag eens terug!"
19427425,"We really enjoyed our staying in Fenno's place. It 's a lovely and well decorated . Fenno showed us all the places where to go and as well tasty good restaurant. The flat is very well located, close to down town '( 10 mn walk ) and shops. Fenno is a very kind host. The kitchen is very well furnished and you can easily cook every things."
19429538,"Mirjam is a perfect example of an ideal Airbnb host: very welcoming, very clear communication from the beginning, attention to all manner of detail in terms of finding her place, how to gain access, etc, which is extremely important given the location being in the heart of Amsterdam. There was zero confusion and I arrived smoothly because of her wonderful conscientiousness. Her flat is every bit as charming as the photo, but even more with the charming view from the windows. Also, the flat is surprisingly quiet and restful with a wonderfully comfortable bed! It is a perfect location to find and to explore the city on foot! I absolutely loved it! "
19434811,"We would like to thank Anneke for a wonderful welcome in her gorgeous houseboat. Everything was perfect and made our stay so enjoyable!The location is perfect too, close to the centre and very quiet at the same time. We would highly recommend to stay with Anneke, she is the perfect host!<br/>Albertine&Fred"
19436805,"Fenno est un hôte sérieux,très sympathique et arrangeant. Très bon accueil. Il nous a fait un petit guide avec ses endroits préférés dans la ville (restaurants, bar,...). Appartement propre, coloré et bien confortable.  Nous avons passé un très bon weekend. Merci à toi Fenno pour ce séjour."
19453555,"As a perfect host Bronte gave us in advance so many usefull information we didn't have to check on Internet to get to the Apartment and to all the famous Sightseeing. The Apartment is small but really cosy - it was very nice! <br/><br/>"
19459987,"Greeted by Wendy with coffee and waffles- when in Amsterdam...<br/>Wendy could not have been more accommodating when it came to check in and check out- we had an evening flight so left mid afternoon.<br/>The apartment itself could not have been better for getting a feeling of living like an Amsterdammer . Loved the area , only a short walk to the Albert Cuyp market, plenty of shops and good eating places all close by. Would highly recommend a stay."
19463968,"We really enjoyed our stay at Corina's airbnb! <br/><br/>We arrived by bus (197) from the airport (~30 Minutes plus a 5 minutes walk). As the house is located close to all the interesting spots, we could walk everywhere (e.g. 15 minutes to Rijk-Museum or city center, fantastic)!<br/><br/>thanks, Corina for sharing your very nice space!<br/><br/><br/> "
19471954,"Maria was warm and welcoming and gave us wonderful tips about the city. Her home is in a lovely and central area. If we are ever back in Amsterdam, we would be happy to stay with her again!"
19488431,"Appartement propre, très calme, à quelques pas de Dam.<br/>Mirjam est très accueillante.<br/>Excellent petit déjeuner ! Excellent accueil. Marga et Rico sont des hôtes très sympas.<br/>Le gite est calme, et idéalement situé pour ceux qui recherchent la proximité avec le RAI ( convention center ) : 20 minutes à pieds. Il est également possible de louer un vélo ..."
19495088,"Von meinem kurzen Besuch in der Unterkunft von Marga und Rico war ich sehr begeistert!<br/>Das Zimmer war sehr gemütlich und das Hausboot auf der Amstel, auf dem Marga und Rico direkt nebenan mit ihren Kindern wohnen  ist wirklich ganz besonders schön. <br/>Marga und Rico sind sehr nett und hilfsbereit, ich habe mich sehr willkommen und wohl gefühlt!<br/>Gerne komme ich wieder in diese besonders schöne Unterkunft! <br/><br/>"
19496543,"'The' spot to be. It's the most centrally located house with bars & coffee shops just below. In very close walking distance of all the hot spots like Rembrandt Square, Leidse Square and 5 minutes by tram to Central station, Dam Square & Jordaan. Can't get better in terms of location. On top of that, Edwin is an ever smiling & extremely sweet and warm host who made me feel very comfortable during my stay. "
19502375,Vera was there to welcome us when we were there. The neighbourhood is lovely and the room is cosy. There is a small mini fridge just behind the table and Vera gave us a new set of towels on our third day there. There is a tram which goes to Leidseplein and Amsterdam Central so its very convenient. There is a  supermarket nearby for us to buy snacks and water and since it was a Saturday Vera did shared with us there was a small market nearby.  That was nice of her. Hoping to come back to ams in near future... :)
19511874,"Rosie's place was excellent. It is in a great location convenient to some nice shopping and cafes. The room was clean, with a balcony and bathroom was very nice. Rosie is a great personality, fun to talk and share stories with. She accommodated me on short notice and was very communicative. I would definitely stay with Rosie again!"
19512096,"Toetsie was a lovely host who provided everything you could need for a weekend trip to Amsterdam! We would definitely recommend it...much nicer than a nondescript hotel room, in a beautiful part of town and really good value! "
19528135,"The room is perfect, plus it is exactly as shown in the pictures. The location is great, just a few stops from the center on the tram and also in walking distance from a huge bike rental store. Wilma is very kind and was very helpful! Bonnie the cat is also amazing! I would definitely choose to stay there the next time I will be in Amsterdam! "
19560533,"Our week end in Amsterdam was awesome. The appartment is really Nice, cosy and there is everything you could need for a couple of days.<br/>The neighborhood is great, calm and beautiful. You can rent bikes down the street, there is the bus, the tram, a supermarket...<br/>Albertine is a great host, very friendly and welcoming. She told us all the Nice places to hang out, restaurant, bars...<br/>We spent a really good week end in Albertine's appartment!!! :)"
19570766,"Wir hatten wunderschöne Tage in Amsterdam - nicht zuletzt wegen der schönen Unterkunft. Das Zimmer ist super-schön, modern und prakmatisch eingerichtet. Die Gastgeber sind sehr nett und äußerst hilfsbereit. <br/>Auf jeden Fall: ***** (Fünf-Sterne) <br/>"
19588548,"Tout simplement parfait ! Suffisamment éloigné des pièges a touristes du centre, et très bien desservi par le tram (7, 17, 13, 14...). Nous étions deux adultes avec trois enfants, et Lucas avait gentiment prévu un petit lit pour notre petit dernier (qui a un an). La maison sur l'eau a fait le bonheur de nos enfants, qui guettaient l'arrivée des canards tous les matins. Maison très fonctionnelle : lave vaisselle, frigo, congélo (pour les glaces!), superbe salle de bain spacieuse.<br/>Le quartier est très agréable,  a deux pas du Vondelpark où nous avons passé des heures... Proche du centre aussi (10 minutes de tram). Bref, nous avons passé un très très bon moment a Amsterdam, et la maison de Lucas y est pour beaucoup ! Merci Lucas !"
19666833,"Vibeke was such a good host! She was really warm in welcoming us into her home and helped us with everything we needed. Her place is really close to 2 trams and a bus to the central station- making it very easy to commute around Amsterdam. Also nearby is a supermarket and pharmacy. We will definitely recommend Vibeke to our friends and family visiting the city, she was extremely accomodating and a lovely person! Thank you Vibeke! "
19674893,"Just Perfect!<br/>Perfect location, perfect bed, perfect clean, 5 star quality in price of 3 star quality.<br/>David was super kindness..<br/>Sure that we gonna back to this apartmant next time in amstersam. <br/>Super Recommended!"
19697553,"Gina sait réellement comment accueillir ses hôtes : l'on se sent chez soi dès la première minute. <br/>Le logement était impeccable ; le quartier, proche du centre, réellement calme...Un vrai plaisir !<br/>"
19699937,"We had a lovely three days in Amsterdam. Elmar is a very nice friendly host and his apartment is just great. So much space everything you need is available. <br/><br/>Thank you Elmar .. we will probably come back but then for a longer time if you do not mind. <br/><br/>Best Regards <br/><br/>Torsten"
19740927,"nice welcome, the host was out of town but his friend/neighbor let me in and showed me around. very nice setup, comfortable bed, nice bathroom, coffee/tea/snacks in the room. and the location is excellent."
19783755,"The moment we entered the B&B Petra made us feel very welcome! Wochenende booked only one day in advance but the still the communication and organisation went really smooth. The room itself is just like on the pictures, clean and cozy. The neighbourhood is not too crowded but still you get a impression of the life in Amsterdam (cute cafes and bars) and it takes you only a 15 minutes walk to get to the museums. Really nice room, almost like an own apartment with your own bath and little kitchen. The communication was fast and uncomplicated. Would definitely recommend a stay and we will return the next time we're in Amsterdam."
19797515,"This was definitely the best experience we've had staying with people like this. Harald and Edith made us feel so welcome and were extremely helpful in all aspects. The room was even better than the description - a lovely self contained unit with cooking facilities, own bathroom and a sweet little garden to sit out in! The location was ideal, very quick and easy to the centre on bikes - less than 10 mins! Lovely area to be in with a gorgeous view of the Amstel canal. Convenient supermarkets so close and lovely bakeries. <br/>I can't recommend this place and the hosts enough, hopefully we will have a chance to visit again. A fabulous stay in a very exciting city. 10/10! "
19802362,"Wouter and his apartment are great! It was our first booking with airbnb and he was very friendly and helpful. The apartment was clean and the rooftop terasse is wonderful! The tram station is right in front of the house, so it was very easy to go to the city center within 10 minutes. We really enjoyed our stay! :-D"
19841513,"We loved our stay in Amsterdam. We didn't meet Sarah-Jane as she was out of the country but her parents met us at check in and check out and were so kind and helpful. The apartment was very well equipped with everything we needed for tea and coffee etc. it is small but perfect for two to stay comfortably. The location was great too, everything was within about a 20 minute walk and there were lots of cafes and restaurants close by."
19853265,Marga's place is beautiful and very peaceful. I had a lovely stay! Thank you again.
19857806,"Staying at Mike's was a wonderful experience. The apartment is spotless and perfect for two. It comes equipped with everything you might need including bath products, breakfast food and coffee. The area (De Pijp) is really chill and relaxing, full of restaurants and some shops and not too far from central. Mike was super helpful and always available. Would definitely stay there again!"
19920675,Olaf es una persona muy divertida generosa con la que puedes compartir un rato.Te ayudará en todo lo que pueda.La casa es un museo de disney.Todo eataba limpio e impecable.Genial.
19977615,"Ich war mit einer Kollegin auf einem Kongress in Amsterdam. Auf der web site von Aibbnb hat uns die Unterkunft bei Edith und Harald sehr gut gefallen, denn es traf ganz, was wir uns wünschten für die drei Nächte: Zwei getrennte Bette, ein privates Bad, sehr ruhig, nah an die Universität und dazu noch einen kleinen Garten, den wir benutzen dürften! Dass es noch eine Küche gab, hatte ich bei der Buchung gar nicht registriert. <br/>Und es war genau alles so, wie es beschrieben würde. Was Ruhe und Sauberkeit betrifft, war alles absolut einwandfrei. Es war gemütlich und schön.<br/>Von der Ankunft an bis zu der Abreise waren Edith und Harald sehr gastfreundlich und sie kamen uns sehr entgegen. Sehr schön war es, dass wir gleich am ersten Abend beim Tee und Kekse lange im Wohnzimmer saßen und uns so unterhalten haben, als wir uns schon seit Langen kannten. <br/>Sie haben uns nützliche Tipps gegeben, den Weg beschrieben und sofort gehandelt, wenn etwas nötig war. Wir würden sehr gerne wieder bei Edith und Harald den garden room mieten. <br/>Es war sehr schön, abends sehr müde von den anstrengenden Tag den Gefühl zu haben, dass wir nach Hause gingen! <br/>Wir danken Edith und Harald sehr für den Vertrauen und für den sehr gastfreundlichen Aufenthalt. <br/>Maria"
19989061,"Edwin's guesthouse is perfect for anyone visiting Amsterdam!  Everything was exactly as described, Edwin was extremely hospitable and his cat was delightful! The room was clean and the location was more than perfect just steps from the flower market. I recommend Edwin's guesthouse to anyone looking for a quick stay in Amsterdam!"
19991981,"A very nice experience! The team of Genesis Marine Division stayed in style on a ship in Amsterdam during ISE 2016 and it gave our stay a unique touch. Whilst organizing the trip Petra was always really nice and reactive by mail. The boat is really perfectly located in Amsterdam, surroundings are beautiful, in the quiet and charming district of Plantage. We had a great time during one week and felt a bit like dutch sailors...with all the comfort a john boat offers. Martin is the real treasure, always there, nice and available. Many thanks Petra/Martin - we are already looking to return one day :)"
19995484,"Simone je bent een geweldige gastvrouw. Het verblijf voor onze Tanzaniaanse gast was fantastisch en jij hebt daar een grote bijdrage aan geleverd.<br/>Je hebt hem niet alleen kennis laten maken met typisch Hollandse gewoonten en voedsel maar ook met jouw bijzondere gastvrijheid. Iedereen zou zich zo'n heerlijk verblijf en vriendelijke gastvrouw wensen. Simone is een geweldige gastvrouw. Ze heeft het onze gast enorm naar de zin gemaakt. Bij aankomst verraste ze ons met een heerlijk ontbijt. Daarna heeft ze met onze gast de route naar het ziekenhuis verkent, waar hij de komende tijd zou gaan werken.<br/>Hij heeft niets dan lof over het onderkomen en de goede zorgen van Simone. <br/>In de directe omgeving is alles voor handen wat nodig is voor een prettig verblijf namelijk openbaar vervoer en winkels. Deze accommodatie is iedereen aan te raden die op zoek is naar een rustig onderkomen.  Maro heeft een geweldige tijd gehad bij Simone. Ze is zorgzaam, erg gastvrij en heeft hem, als Tanzaniaan,  zelfs kennis laten maken met Sinterklaas. Met de warme trui, muts en wanten was hij prima uitgerust voor de Hollandse kou. Als hij terug komt naar Nederland zou hij graag weer bij haar willen wonen."
19997035,"We enjoyed our weekend staying in the houseboat apt. Pictures are accurate (but don't capture how comfortable the bed is...it was REALLY nice and King-sized).  The apt was nicely fitted out with some fruit, milk, juice. It also had a small kitchen, utensils, coffee, etc. There was plenty of hot water.  <br/>Transportation links are good. At least three different trams or buses stop near the houseboat.  There is a grocery store nearby and we found several cafes in the vicinity.<br/>The houseboat is quiet (the loudest noise came from the rain on the roof and the ducks outside).  <br/>Overall we really enjoyed it. It's a unique experience and we were really glad we stayed here."
20012058,"Sally's place is a jewel in a wonderful part of Amsterdam. Elegantly decorated and very recently renovated, her apartment is extremely well-equipped and comfortable. Everything is brand-new. The beautiful Vondelpark and many hip restaurants and shops are just a block or two away, and many of the must-see Amsterdam museums are a short tram ride or walk away. We had no trouble finding parking right in front of the apartment. Our family was very lucky to have been the first to stay in Sally's lovely home. Sally, thank you so much for your hospitality - you really have thought of everything! - and we hope to return someday. "
20013928,Rosie is lovely served a nice breakfast every morning and it was a very comfortable environment and loved the shower  <br/>Only negative point was the room was a bit cold and the heating didn't seen to work well but otherwise we had a great and enjoyable time.  Loved tge morning breakfast conversations to and she told us cool places to check out which was great.
20015439,Truus was a really friendly host and her studio is beautifully furnished and decorated. She helped us a lot during our stay in Amsterdam with her spontanious answer of our booking request and her usefull tipps. We had a very pleasant stay and would love to come back to her studio again! 
20031509,"Viola und Daniel haben wirklich ein wundervolles Zimmer - die Bilder lügen nicht! Man hat direkten Blick auf zwei Grachten und den kleinen Platz vor der Haustür. Im Untergeschoss ein Gebäude weiter ist auch direkt ein Café.<br/>Die Wohnung ist nicht übermäßig groß (ebenso wie die Treppe die nach oben führt - die ist Amsterdam-typisch sehr schmal) aber sehr wohnlich und stylisch eingerichtet. Das Badezimmer ist nicht durch eine Tür vom Rest der Wohnung abgetrennt, das sollte man beachten, wenn man zu zweit unterwegs ist :) <br/>Viola haben wir nicht getroffen, dafür hat uns aber Daniel eine ausführliche Einweisung gegeben und mit Tips zu Amsterdam und den Schließfächern im Hbf. versorgt. Alles in allem kann ich nur sagen: Wir kommen gern wieder!"
20034410,"(Submitting this on behalf of my Dad for who I booked the accommodation). ""The accommodation was good - about 20 minutes tram drive to the centre. People were very friendly. Overall a good experience. I wouldn't rate it too high in the value for money category as we were charged more than the advertised rate. No complaints otherwise. """
20041339,"Enith foi incrível! desde os contatos antes da chegada até a entrada na casa. A casa é extremamente agradável, limpa e confortável, supera as fotos! Fica num bairro a 4km do centro, super fácil acesso de bicicleta. O quarto é amplo e confortável. Enith é super amável e atenciosa. Super recomendo e com certeza, quando retornar a Amsterdan, ficarei aqui novamente!"
20058928,"The location is very good, a 10-15 minutes walk to center. Around the corner there are nice pubs, bakery, supermarket and a metro. <br/>The house is VERY beautiful, much more than  what you expect from looking at the pictures... It is very spacious and the master bedroom is a basically a suite with a great view on the canals<br/>The owner provided us with all we needed (fully equiped kitchen, bed linen, towels, toilet paper and even coffee for the machine ). <br/>The host is very welcoming and was very responsive and helpful<br/>We had a great time and were sorry we did not spent all our 10 days in it instead of spending a week at the near by center-park.<br/>The only problem is that parking is not free and cost 4 euro per hour which means 38 per day. It is possible to park outside of the city but it can take you an hour. so if you consider this extra 38 euro as an additional cost of the apartment you can park near the house easily<br/>bottom line: great experience and great value for your money <br/>"
20059321,"Joke and Gerard are both extremely welcoming and wonderful people. My girlfriend and I really enjoyed our stay with them. The room and the house-boat are really charming, clean and comfy. The cherry on the top of the cake was when they offered us a boat trip in the canals of Amsterdam, we were very lucky to have Gerard giving us a tour of the city this way! I would recommend them with no doubt to anybody and I hope myself to meet them again!"
20070668,"Great room, warm, comfortable, silent and independent. The best location, in the centre, walking distance to Red light district, museums, Jordaan...to everywhere! Direct bus from the airport. Wendy and Hans are very nice and welcoming, at our arrival they gave us a map and wonderful tips. We had a lot of fun sharing some experiencies with them when we met in the stairs! "
20071013,"Skoukjie was an amazing host. Very friendly and accommodating. We had a very pleasant stay at her place. Not super central to all the museums but the public transportation system in Amsterdam is amazing. You can also rent a bike or walk =)<br/><br/>I would definitely stay at her place again for my next visit. Five stars from me."
20085641,This place was very comfortable after a long day of exploring the city. It's close to public transportation that allows you to get to the city square in less than 15 minutes. The apartment was accurately described and clean. The wifi was also great. The host was very communicative and easy to reach if needed. I'd highly recommend this place to anyone.
20111127,"Une chambre très belle, très spacieuse, lumineuse, une jolie vue, propre. Bonne situation géographique, agréable à faire à pied Amsterdam n'est pas très grand.<br/>Un séjour vraiment très agréable avec un super temps."
20159741,"La casa è molto carina e accogliente, la zona tranquilla e ben collegata con il centro e i proprietari molto gentili. Bellissimo soggiorno"
20164231,"Merci Vibeke, c'était notre premier voyage avec Airbnb, nous sommes enchantés ! Vous êtes très souriante et accueillante, c'était pour nous un plaisir de passer ces quelques jours chez vous."
20166718,"Our stay at Alex's apartment was brilliant. The photos do not do it justice and the rooms are larger than they appear. The bedroom is nice and cosy with an extremely comfortable bed. There is a chest of drawers to store clothes, however no hanging space unfortunately. The living room is spacious with a large comfortable sofa (which also folds out as a bed though we didn’t try it). We had an extra guest for a couple of nights and bedding was provided which was great. There is Apple tv for guests to use which is great if you have Netflix. We were a little disappointed that the record player wasn't there as shown in the photos, however understand why. The kitchen has everything you could need and the best facilities we've experienced through Airbnb so far. The bathroom has a lovely big bath and shower and leads onto the balcony which is spacious and quiet as it overlooks the centre of the block.<br/><br/>Alex was a great host, he communicated with us prior to arrival and check out to make sure everything was ok. There was plenty of tourist information available for us to use, a guide to the flat and list of recommendations for the local area. There was also a nice bottle of wine for us on arrival and we were told we could use what ever was in the fridge. The apartment is in a residential area so it felt safe to walk around at night. The supermarket is round the corner and there's lots of nice little cafes and bars nearby. The tram/bus stop is only a couple of minutes walk away so it is very easy to get into the centre. <br/><br/>A couple of things to remember is that Dutch buildings do have thin walls therefore you can hear the neighbours, especially when they have music on, and the flat is on the 2nd floor so be ready to carry your suitcase up a narrow staircase. However all in all, this is a great apartment which I would definitely recommend to anyone coming to Amsterdam.  "
20211230,"super moment chez Toetsie et roky (le chat)! un accueil au petit oignons et une chambre parfaite!! l'appart n'est pas très loin du centre et facile à trouver avec les indications données dans la description! <br/>bref tout était parfait!"
20214332,"Nadia is a very friendly person. She lives with her mother and daughter. <br/>Our room was upstairs, clean and spacy enough (I stayed with a friend, so Nadia made the second bed for us). <br/>There is a kitchen where you can cook (with some free snacks and drinks), and clean bathroom with shower.<br/>The appartment is 20 mins with a bus or 6 mins with a train to Amstardam Central Station. <br/>Nadia, thank you for your hospitality!<br/><br/>The area neaby is quite and nice. <br/>I am sure that you will like staying at Nadia's. <br/>"

20262018,"We had a realy great stay at David's. He is very friendly and when we arrived he gave us a citymap and told us where we should go.<br/>The room is very nice and everything is like on the pictures. Every morning we had a basket in front of our door filled with everything we needed for breakfast. It is a great idea and it was really delicous!<br/>We enjoyed our holiday at his house!"
20284691,"Ótima recepção, o lugar é perfeito, rua silenciosa, tudo estava limpo, Anna nos deu todas as informações sobre a estadia, e lugares para a gente visitar, comer, etc.<br/><br/>Recomendo muito eles, tiramos uma foto para o painel e assim que possível enviamos pois queremos estar no painel que mostra quem já passou por la..<br/><br/>Beijos e abraços"
20307973,"Together with a friend i spent three nights in Marijkes room. She was very kind, considered our arriving-time and gave us everything we needed. Having breakfast in her garden was really a great start in the day!<br/>As you can see on the map, it is quite a walk to the center/Amsterdam Centraal, but there are trains and busses running even at nighttime.<br/>Although Marijkes offers a room for three persons, i guess there will be not enough space for luggage and stuff for three people. But i am sure that Marijke will make everything possible to give you a comfortable stay! The room Liliana offers has two soft beds and is very clean as the rest of the flat. It is super quite at night! I haven't seen much of the neighbourhood because i took the bus to city center. The station is really close, just a three minute walk. The station of the night-bus is about 10 minutes away.<br/>Liliana and her teenage son were really friendly! Everything was fine."
20312152,"Thank you for this great staying, we felt very comfortable.<br/>Laura and Arjan are great hosts and really nice. Thank´s for that!<br/>We will be back!"
20315815,"Olaf was very welcoming. When we arrived, he welcomed us with hot coffee and stroopwaffel, what a good way to start the day. <br/>The flat is very practical, rooms were tidy and comfy. <br/>The neighbour is quiet and safe. <br/>Don't think twice about booking this place !  "
20343091,"Vibeke is probably the BEST host that I've had the pleasure of speaking to. She is so kind and is very thorough with instructions and went out of her way to find helpful information for me. She is also very attentive and fast at responding. On the day of my arrival, I got lost and she had her brother come pick us up! Her apartment was absolutely darling. My friend and I had a lovely stay in Amsterdam and coming home to this warm and cute apartment was just the cherry on top.  The neighborhood was very safe and in a nice quiet residential area. It also wasn't too far from city center (just about 15 min bike ride to Haarlemerplein and another 15 min to Centraal Station). Would 100% recommend to anyone!"
20369690,Great location in a beautiful area of Amsterdam. Frits is a great host! Nice and clean flat and great info provided. I'll rent of him again.. 
20387127,Had a nice stay at toetsie's place. She was very kind and relaxed and gave us advice as good as possible. Everything was as described. Especially the train card's and the breakfast were awesome. Thanks Alex and Sophia
20389298,Wat een heerlijke plek hebben Marga en Rico hier gecreëerd. Het ademt gastvrijheid! Het huisje is heel gezellig en knus. Het ligt op loopafstand van OV en ideaal dat we ook fietsen konden huren. Een centraal gelegen plek waar je het gevoel hebt in een oase in de stad te zijn. Dankjewel Marga en Rico!
20406165,Laura & Arjen are amazing. We had such a lovely stay and we'd happily stay again. They make everything so relaxed and easy. Definitely my best ever AirBnb experience ever. 
20426827,"Me and my two friends have enjoyed an amazing four night stay in Olaf's wonderful apartment! Olaf made us feel right at home, and all provisions like towels and coffee were available to us! De Pijp is a gorgeous neighbourhood full of hip cafes and restaurants. The centre was within comfortable walking distance, and we took advantage of the lovely weather to explore this beautiful city on foot. However, the number 4 tram is another option! This was our first experience with airbnb, but it definitely won't be our last. Thank you, Olaf!"
20429279,"Tout était parfait ! Excellent séjour, grand appartement lumineux et communication et accueil très sympas. On reviendra sans hésitation !"
20441926,Nadia and accommodations were exceptional. Both her and her daughter left a pleasant and clean atmosphere. My girlfriend and I thought the room very tidy and the adjoining kitchen equal to or above expectations. If we were to stay in Amsterdam again we would most definitely book Nadia again! We didn't get a chance to say goodbye but thank you so much Nadia it was a pleasure!!
20444907,"Marga, dank voor je gastvrijheid. We hebben genoten van de hectiek in Amsterdam en van het geweldige concert van U2. Daarna heerlijk in jullie huisje geslapen in de oase van rust. Fijn dat we bij jou konden zijn.<br/>"
20446112,"It was my boyfriend and I's first stay in Amsterdam and using Airbnb and we definitely have no regrets. David's place is soo central, right next to the station, red light district, restaurants, 'coffeshops' and high street shops! We could walk to everything! Yet we heard none of the background noise in our room. The room itself was large, clean, stylish and everything we was looking for. We visited the Hilton at the station as my brother was staying there and I have to say... David's room was much nicer.  The breakfast was lovely and soo handy to be able to eat it in our rooms. It felt like a home away from home. I would recommend to anyone and will definitely be looking at when I can stay here again. Thank you David for a wonderful trip."
20461246,"Simone is a lovely host, frexible, and helpful.  She helped my trip plan.  Her house, is a bit further from the centre, but located in a wonderful area with beautiful canals. I enjoyed going from and back to her place everyday."
20465381,"Micha is a nice host. He explained us everything and he could also speak German. The flat is as described, clean and all the things you need are there. Location is also nice, only 3 mins away from the metro station."
20465754,"Miellyttävä ja hotelleja reilusti tilavampi huone käytännöllisesti katutasossa. Ystävällinen vastaanotto ja paikkojen esittely. Oma rauha koko olemisen ajan. Yksinkertainen WC käytävällä ja yläkerran kylppärissä suihkukoppi. Jyrkät portaat. Alakerrassa pieni keittiö käytettävissä tarvikkeineen aamiaista varten ja pikkukaupat nurkan takana. Talvella kylmät lattiat, joten ota omat tohvelit tai villasukat mukaan. Huoneessa tehokas lämmitin takan edessä. Huoneessa TV, matkaradio, internet ja pahvi jakkarat."
20479914,"Alles wunderbar, sehr sympathische Unterkunft, da kommt man gerne wieder.<br/>Ankunft sehr unkompliziert, ebenso der gesamte Aufenthalt, Anneke hat mit allem dafür gesorgt dass wir uns willkommen und gut versorgt gefühlt haben - das Angebot hat unsere Erwartungen übertroffen.<br/>"

20507822,"Jeg følte meg meget velkommen, og stedet var veldig sjarmerende.  Nabolaget virket hyggelig og litt landlig. Verten var meget omtenksom, alt fungerte, så jeg manglet ikke noe. Jeg ble til og med hentet og bragt.<br/>Dette er et sted som jeg svært gjerne ønsker å benytte en annen gang. I visited this place last year. This year I was welcomed as a dear friend. They are a friendly couple, making you feel very comfortable. The room was very clean, warm - and cozy. I sincerely recommend this place.<br/>I would like to come back next time I am in Amsterdam."
20508042,"Edwin. Edwin. where do I begin.... Edwin's guesthouse is amazing... the place is very central, close to everything. didn't need to buy public transport ticket because it's so close to everywhere. Edwin told me what bus to take and where to go to reach the place. Edwin's house is an old school Dutch house with skinny spiral stairs. it wasn't too bad of a stairs. the room is a queen size bed // double bed. it is very spacious. there's a TV with DVDs ( if you decide to stay in watch tv in Amsterdam!!!). although the place is loud at night, you must understand that this place is in central Amsterdam where party goes anytime of the dam. <br/>Edwin is the bomb. he took me all over town and even got me to do haircut! best hostess, ahem, host yet!!!! "
20514658,"A perfect stay in Amsterdam. Very clean, all new furniture, completely private, the best bed we have ever slept in. Tea, coffee, minifridge. Spacious bathroom with very good shower. Perfect breakfast exactly to our wishes. Quiet but close to center by foot, metro or tram. Communications very good: clear and fast reactions. Highly recommended! Better than any hotel I've ever been. "
20515004,"L'appartement est vraiment bien décoré et très chaleureux, bien chauffé (nous y sommes allées en décembre), très propre et dans un quartier vraiment sympa (shopping, cafés, restaurants). Le logement se trouve à dix minutes d'a peu près partout, c'est donc idéal. Ifigenia a été vraiment adorable, nous a donné beaucoup de conseils et nous a laissé à disposition un classeur, rédiger par ses soins, sur toutes les choses à faire à Amsterdam. Le fait qu'Ifigenia et son mari habitent juste au dessus de l'appartement rend les choses très pratiques et la prise de contact en cas de problèmes très rapide. Je recommande ce logement, mais surtout l'hôte. Mention spéciale pour le lit double à moteur électrique!!!!"
20517544,"Hein and the appartement were really great. We came a bit late but Hein was ready to welcome us. <br/>He explained to us the nice places to see and where to walk around. <br/>The appartement was rather small but well converted and fully equipped. It was a kind of a little nest, with a comfortable bed. It was close to the metro and the tram station. <br/>Our Journey was great and Hein was really kind to us, he's a lovely human-being"
20518937,Everything was perfect during our stay in Amsterdam. The location is right in the center and every spot is in walking distance. Matthijs responded very fast to our messages and gave us some tips (don't come by car :D ) on where we can go in the city. I can definitely recommend this accomodation and would book this room again for another stay in Amsterdam.
20543694,"Edwin is friendly and humorous guide, his house is<br/>warm and sweet, I really enjoyed it when I stayed in Amsterdam. It's really convenient just located in central. Mirjam is really nice and house is clean,<br/>it's very suitable to young people or alone to stay here, it's really convenient area."
20544890,The apartment of Viola and Daniel is very nice and clean. It has a nice view and is very open. It offers you everything you need and is equipped very well. The contact with them was very uncomplicated. We would definetly come back to stay at Viola's and Daniel's Place.
20570149,"Bedankt marloes en gabriel! Mede dankzij jullie tips, super mooie app op een perfecte locatie en de fietsen die we mochten lenen, hebben wij een een onvergetelijk weekend gehad!!! <br/>Groetjes Wendy en Suzan. "
20572671,"super !!!<br/>Everything was perfect, the location was very central, everything was very clean and the Jacqueline was very friendly... ;)"
20579147,"IT was a great stay indeed. lovely little house, with the back open space :).  Fenno was very helpfull and the house / apartment is very cozy.  LOcation is amazing you can reach central area with a 20min  walk, 5 min by bike. Still quite local hood what is good since amsterdam is so touristic. "
20595222,"So nice, so friendly, so welcoming, so good!<br/>Thank you Toetsie"
20597737,"We were at the double room and I don't have anything wrong to say. The room was clean and cozy, house in the best location. Edwin is really nice, fun and ready to answer all questions. There is just one rule: don't let out the cat! Hope to come back sometime."
20604448,"David nous a très bien accueilli, il nous a donné une carte vraiment utile pour visiter Amsterdam. La chambre est parfaite, spacieuse, très propre, avec une literie d'une qualité irréprochable et David a pensé à tous les petits détails pour améliorer votre séjour ! L'appartement est très bien situé à seulement 5 minutes à pied d'Amsterdam centraal. Nous avons tout fait à pied. Il y a plein de bons restaurant à faire non loin de l'appartement ! Bref nous recommanderons les yeux fermés cet appartement !"
20608508,大衛的房間位置很好，離中央車站步行可到達，房間乾淨，睡覺時也很安靜，是個好地方
20638369,"Marijke was a friendly host and the room was very comfy (there are 2 bad, a little couch, a microwave oven and other more things). Case, the cat, was so cute and everything was cleaned. The home is in the east of Amsterdam and in 1 minute to walk there is Muiderport station and bus. I and my friends loved stay there. Absolutly reccomendable! I love amsterdam"
20640844,"We had such a lovely experience with Jo. She was helpful, responsive and welcoming right from the beginning. She was quick to reply to our reservation request and any messages we sent. We were several hours late and Jo could not have been more understanding. When we arrived she launched into showing us around and showing us all her maps and a big folder full of information. We had never been to Amsterdam before and this was super helpful and made us feel very welcome. We really appreciate the effort that went into making the folder and showing us all the good places on the map. <br/>The apartment exceeded the photos. Its absolutely lovely! Really well designed, simple classy decor and spotlessly clean (and I'm a bit OCD when it comes to cleaning!). We had everything we could possibly need and felt at home . The bed was comfortable and the shower was nice and warm with plenty of pressure. <br/>The neighbourhood was quiet and safe and had a nice vibe to it. There were quite a few restaurants and cafes close by. Very easy to access from Waterloo Plein train station. <br/>We had a lovely time in this excellent apartment and the experience was made extra special by Jo's excellent hospitality. We highly recommend staying here and would love to stay here again :) "
20666185,Marienke was so welcoming and extremely friendly upon our arrival. Along with a bottle of wine and bottled water! The studio looks exactly like the photos and it's absolutely spotless. Marienke responded to any questions I had immediately. The location is about 15 minutes by bike outside the city center and was fairly easy to get there. Definitely recommend this place Marienke was SUCH a sweetheart!
20677650,"After already a wonderful first stay on Sonja´s houseboat we decided to come back to Amsterdam for a relaxing weekend in Amsterdam during the festival of lights this winter. You have everything you need from coffee in the morning to a clean bathroom, a very comfortable bed with seeing the sky above you though the window when you wake up and just a great location. Only a 20minute walk until you reach the Prinsengracht. Tasty locations to eat you can have in 5-10 minutes walk. And the best is just this boat after a long day out with its relaxing atmosphere. Highly recommended! Me and my friend had a wonderful weekend in Amsterdam while staying at Marion´s place. After a warm welcome we could explore the city with the bikes she provided for our stay. Upon arrival but also any time before that she responded to every question very fast and gave lots of advice. The room was nice and clean and so was the bathroom. The beds were just highly comfortable and allowed us to recover from a long day in the city. I can highly recommend the room also with regard to the very nice neighbourhood. If you search for a great place to have breakfast you will find an amazing spot just around the corner called ""bakers and roasters"" - you definitely have to try one of their dishes. Moreover there are two spots to rent boat bikes very close by - also something to recommend and preferred if you want to explore the city also by water.<br/>We would definitely stay here again and also hope to be back at some point in the near future. "
20678661,"Nous avons passé un moment merveilleux chez David qui est véritablement l'hôte parfait, extrêmement attentionné. La chambre que nous occupions pendant quatre jours étaient très agréable, le quartier animé, tout prêt de la gare : un vrai bonheur ! L'accueil était très chaleureux, les petits-déjeuners derrière la porte très appréciés : bref, nous recommandons vivement cette adresse pour profiter pleinement d'Amsterdam ! <br/>Et surtout, merci David ;)."
20678667,"We were made to feel very welcome, we arranged beforehand with Caroline and her friend Wieke at what time we would arrive and she gave us great directions to the apartment. <br/><br/>The apartment was actually very big for Amsterdam and we enjoyed it very much, it is a 5 minute walk to the center but the apartment is still in a quieter area. <br/><br/>If we go to Amsterdam again we will be sure to check out this apartment without hesitation. "
20688125,"Hein's studio is well located and close to several shops and supermarkets. The studio could be a little small if you are planning to stay for many days. Hein give us lots of places to visit and how to scape from the obvious turistic attractions, he is a really fun guy with lots of experience about the city. I would recommend the place for sure"
20718934,Very nice and comfortable. In a quiet and residential area surrounding by now pleasant good options. Very close (10 minute bike ride) to the most central locations. <br/>We had a great time!
20721340,"My friend and I stayed at Jeroen's for 4 nights. We had a great time there. He gave us a lot of very useful tips about things to do, restaurants and cafe in Amsterdam. The best experiences we had while we were there! The apartment is 15 min away from the station by bus or by bike,  1 hour if you prefer walking. Make sure you bring sweaters cause it can be a bit chilly inside. However, he was very kind and answered really quickly to our questions. Thanks a lot!"
20728127,"Arjan, Prema, Cookie and especially Sweetheart were brilliant hosts. Easygoing, generous, knowledgeable and fun - we throughly enjoyed our time with them and very much hope it won't be the last time. <br/>Their flat is in a good location, is incredibly well decorated and has a large garden. Our room was really nice and our 3 man group had plenty of space. <br/>I would absolutely recommend staying with them if you want to enjoy your time in Amsterdam. Sadly we made the mistake of going elsewhere in Europe, we should have just stayed with them!"
20731411,Martin was an extremely friendly and accommodating host. He gave precise instructions for how to get to his apartment which was a huge help because I had never been to Amsterdam  before. I really enjoyed staying at his apartment. His area is beautiful and peaceful with a great tram line that takes you right into the city center and it is also quite close to the train station. I think Martin was one of the reasons that I loved Amsterdam as much as I did. 
20740795,"Enith is een uitstekende gastvrouw, als een stewardes betaamd. Heel attent en behulpzaam was ze aanwezig, zonder opdringerig te zijn. We mochten van de keuken en woonkamer gebruik maken, en kregen spontaan een ontbijt aangeboden.<br/>De slaapkamer die verhuurt wordt zit op de bovenste verdieping, met een mooi uitzicht op het dakterras, een heerlijk bed, en een douche voor jezelf naast de slaapkamer. De WC is 1 verdieping lager. De slaapkamer heeft verder geen faciliteiten, die kon je wel gebruiken in het privé gedeelte van Enith. <br/>De omgeving is rustig te noemen, en toch zit je midden in het Amsterdamse leven met op loopafstand winkels en cafeetjes.  Het echte centrum is een paar km verderop."
20750140,"Rosie and Matt were fantastic hosts.  The room and location were exactly as described.  The location was super.  The instructions for getting there from the airport and train station were exactly as stated. The location was very convenient for everything I wanted to do.  I really enjoyed our conversations, and getting acquainted.  When I had trouble figuring out train connections, they were super helpful in finding out for me what I needed to know and how to get places.  I had a great time in Amsterdam and I would love to stay there again.  Thank you Rosie and Matt!  This was my first time travelling solo in a long time and you both helped make it special and smooth sailing!"
20751453,"Excellent house boat and perfect for our stay in Amsterdam. Literally right around the corner from public transportation, and a unique way to enjoy the city. We'd enjoy another stay!"
20758683,"Ruud was really welcoming and helpful throughout our stay, and the apartment itself was cosy and warm. The combination washroom was an interesting experience and the whole studio was clean and well cared for. We never used the terrace but it adds a nice space onto the apartment itself and provides a slightly bigger dining area. All the facilities were in good working order and we found that we (4 students) had enough room to relax while we were there. The location is good, just around the corner from the tram and close to a number of<br/>nice restaurants. Points to consider - The bed is quite high up and the ladder is a little rickety so not great for anyone scared of heights. We had mice visitors while we were there which didn't bother us until they got into our food; luckily the microwave provides a useful storage facility! The stairs are typically Dutch, but they're manageable worth a bit of practice - I have arthritis in my knees and I was okay after the first climb.<br/>Overall a really nice studio in a good location - would definitely come back here!"
20781783,"Getting to stay in (on?) a houseboat in Amsterdam was one of the highlights of my trip. In fact, it was so cute and cosy, it was actually hard to leave! Such a great feeling to come back after a long day of exploring. The Jordaan neighbourhood was very  cool, with lots of great pubs and restaurants close by, and so convenient to the main attractions -- I walked everywhere. Hanneke was away while I visited, but her caretaker was close by and accommodating when I showed up early with massive suitcase! And the bottle of wine and snacks so kind and appreciated after my 3am wakeup call. I loved it here -- Especially when the swan would swim up to the window in the mornings! The boat had all the amenities you would expect and then some great surprises. Hanneke's tips for the city were also very welcome."
20813426,Wir hatten einen sehr schönen Aufenthalt. Rico war sehr freundlich und das Zimmer sehr gemütlich und sauber. <br/>Wir würden wieder kommen! 
20838385,"Thank you Toetsie :)<br/>I'm glad to have chosen your Bed&Breakfast! <br/>The room was cozy, made lovingly cope with small favors and very clean in a cute house with a nice bath and a separate toilet. Toetsie was a fabulous host and she was so friendly and took care for me, I got the feeling she's a friend of mine. Next time I'll go to Amsterdam, I'll book the room again! :)"
20844206,"This appartment is good but has a few problems.<br/>Lets start from the good things.<br/>1) The appartment is very close to the Metro only 2 minutes walk. And 15 minutes to the dam square.<br/>2) Its in a queite nighberhood<br/>3) The appartment is realy good for 2 people.<br/>4) Katja left us some eggs cheese and vegtables and even a bottle of wine.<br/>B-U-T<br/>There were some problems.<br/>1) At this appartment is written that smoking is aloud, but the only problem was that 1 day before we arrived we got a message from Katja that smoking is aloud only in the balcony, and the blakony is very very very small.. To a 1 person its very diffcult to get in and sit there.<br/>2) Allmost all dishes were dirty! We needed to wash the dishes before we ate..<br/>3) The stove does problems.. It works but suddenly it can start sparking and you need to go the electrical cabinet and turn off the switch and then on again.. This is very dangerous and can make a fire in the appartment. We switched off the switch and lighted the stove with a lighter.."
20875347,"We stayed 3 nights in Rick's apartment and it was very beautiful, everything was clean, the balconys were really comfortable for a glass of wine in the evening. <br/>We had towels, hairdryer , apple tv , netflix and a bright kitchen were we were able to cook for ourself.<br/>The only thing which wasn't perfect was that he didn't had any cutlery, but we fixed that and bought some for the next guests who are interested :-). <br/>Alltogether it was a very beautiful apartment in a very calm neighboorhood where you have much possibilities to go wherever you want.<br/>We were pleasently surprised and we would recommend the apartment to everyone who looks for a quite, fine and comfortable apartment!<br/>"
20883034,"We stayed at the warehouse for 3 nights, with 4 Persons. We had a great time! The Place is just amazing, the interior is really, really nice. It’s easily enough space to stay there with even more people. <br/><br/>The Location is nice, right next door is a pretty good Chinese delivery service. The Canal is near, you can sit there nicely. The way from the center is okay to walk, but with bikes it’s really close and the ferry goes through the whole night.<br/><br/>Everything here comes just as promised! Thank you :)"
20886951,"David was an excellent host couldn't of asked for more, he was kind, very welcoming and friendly. <br/><br/>It was a very clean and beautiful apartment with a great view and huge windows letting in lots of light. <br/><br/>David very kindly brought a lovely filling breakfast to our door every morning.  <br/><br/>It was only a short walk from anywhere we needed to get too, but out of the way enough not to be disturbed by noise etc. <br/><br/>Overall had a great stay in Amsterdam and it was definitely an improved long weekend thanks to the fantastic hospitality! <br/><br/>Thank you very much Host David had a wonderful time and will definitely  recommend and consider visiting again. "
20906372,"Mike is a perfect host with a beautiful apartment. The place was perfect for our time in Amsterdam. The bed was comfortable and everything was very comfortable. <br/>The neighborhood ended up being our favorite in the city, with tons of fantastic nearby food and drink options. <br/>Mike is extremely kind and accommodating. Definitely stay here. "
20920836,"Min vært fik mig i høj grad til at føle mig velkommen, han var venlig, afslappet og hjælpsom. Huset, værelset og det fælles badeværelse er ikke den vilde luksus, men det fungerer, hvis man ikke er meget krævende. Til gengæld bor man midt i hvor det hele sker i byen, dejligt, men også meget støjende på weekendaftener og nætter"
20924385,"Appartement très sympathique au centre de Amsterdam, les hôtes sont exceptionnels.<br/>N'hésitez pas si vous voulez passer un séjour comme si vous viviez réellement à Amsterdam "
20933171,"The host from Iambnb, Frits, was very friendly and explained us quickly all amenities. The apartment is small but cozy. Location is great! The bed is probably not the best solution for 2 persons and the kitchenware wasn't all clean. The wardrobe is outside of the Apartment and there is a moquette that literally stinks. Globally it was a good experience and I suggest it only for short stays. "
20940660,"Stephanie and Sebastian were excellent hosts. The place is completely accurate, had everything we needed and in a calm down place. The tram is just outside the door. Stephanie gave us a completely review of the city and helped us in everything. I completely recommend this spot!"
21033587,"A lovely apartment is a quiet, peaceful but central part of Amsterdam.  Marcel and his family made us feel very welcome.  Light and airy, the flat is very comfortable and is only a short walk to all of the main areas of Amsterdam you'd want to visit.  "
21034759,"Amazing apartment! Location is perfect - 5 min walk from the station, plenty of lovely shops, bars and restaurants. Apartment itself is unique and fun, loved the record player. Mas was a brilliant and friendly host, always on hand should we need anything. Would highly recommend and definitely want to return!"
21049971,The room was very clean and spacy. Andrea was a perfect host. We enjoyed our stay in every way!
21063541,"I loved staying in Jordaan Apartment! Frits was very helpful with giving us the layout of the neighborhood and recommendations for getting around. The apartment is in a great location; close to everything but quiet. I would love to stay here again! Unfortunately I goofed and made my reservation for the wrong night, so I didn't actually get to stay at Willem's."
21076985,"The garden apartment of Jo and Hans is an oasis in the middle of Amsterdam. This place is just perfect! The apartment is spatious and clean, and it has direct accsess to a lovely garden. There's a coffee machine and a water boiler in the appartment as well as a collection of various teas and coffee capsules. Jo & Hans compiled a map containing detailed information about the surroundings, local restaurants & bars as well as information about cultural activities. Jo & Hans make you feel welcome from the very first moment. We heartely recommend staying with them! Angi & Rainer"
21077838,"Joke was an excellent host! The room and rest of her apartment are beautiful, very clean, and in a great location relative to all of the essential spots in Amsterdam - just a 15 minute bike or Tram ride away (the stop for which is just across the street). Joke herself is very sweet and accommodating - She was waiting outside for us when we arrived (late in the evening I might add), she kindly made us breakfast every morning, left a nice postcard and Amsterdam key chains for us, and had many excellent tips for things to do in the city. Joke clearly enjoys connecting with people from around the world, and it is easy to see why she is a super host. <br/>Best of luck, Joke! Thank you for the great stay, and we hope to return some day!"
21080301,"Fenno is extremely welcoming and helpful.  Had maps of the area and plenty of time to tell me about the great places to eat and visit nearby.   Also helped with practical advice on travel tips and best parts of town to visit.<br/>The apartment is a good size for two and in a very friendly neighbourhood.  The bed is really comfortable.  The kitchen and living room have everything you need to stay in for a night.<br/>I highly recommend staying here."
21107762,The garden apartment of Jo and Hans was wonderful. The apartment is in a great location as it was close to everything we wanted to do while visiting (website hidden) was a wonderful host and provided us with great maps and tips for navigating the city. The apartment was very clean and lovely. We had a wonderful stay. This was our first AirBnB experience and we had a great one. We highly recommend their garden apartment. 
21113113,Super host and super stay! <br/>The room is even more shiny and clean than in the picture! 
21113613,"Amazing apartment with a great location. Niels was a very welcoming host, and he answered any questions we had, even arranging our taxi to the airport for us. We would definitely stay here again<br/><br/>"
21115827,"Wir hatten einen sehr schönen Aufenthalt auf Karins Hausboot, unsere Erwartungen wurden voll und ganz erfüllt. Die Wohnung ist auf zwei Stockwerke verteilt, unten Küche (sogar mit Frühstücksutensilien ausgestattet) Sofa (zum ausziehen) und Badezimmer mit Dusche, im oberen Stockwerk befindet sich das Schlafzimmer mit einem super großen bequemen Bett. Die Zimmer sind sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet und alles war gepflegt und sehr sauber. Karin hat uns nett mit Tipps versorgt und hat immer eine offene Tür wenn man Zwischendurch etwas benötigt. Das Hausboot liegt fünf Minuten von öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln und einem günstigen Parkhaus entfernt. Es befindet sich direkt neben dem Olympiastadion, also am besten Sportsachen einpacken. "
21119269,Place is very close to a train/tram/bus station from which you take just a few minutes to get to the city center. House is clean. It does match the description. Right around the corner there are many restaurants and stores . Thank you !
21124339,"We really enjoyed our stay at Anna’s B&B. We were warmly welcome and we appreciated Anneke’s attentions in the room, as well as the huge breakfast she prepared for us, which was delicious. As there was a problem with the parking, our hostess helped us find another solution which was the less expensive and accompanied us to make sure it was clear. The houseboat is well located so that we managed to visit the city walking (we chose to walk but it was pleasant to know that two bicycles were available for us), and we were happy to have restaurants nearby. We enjoyed quiet life on the canal, whether it was in the morning for breakfast or in the evening for a glass a Italian wine offered by Anneke. <br/>We highly recommend this place for anyone who wants to visit Amsterdam !<br/>"
21153643,Comfortable home. Quiet. A little Expensive without a kitchen. Very welcoming hosts. 
21153884,"Laura replied  very quickly to e-mail or texting inquiries and gave excellent  information, as for example directions to reach the apartment.  We arrived late and Laura and her husband welcomed us with the proverbial warmest  Dutch hospitality and helped get us settled.  The place was immaculate and fully stocked with towels, toiletries, and the kitchen with dishes, clean dish rags, dish soap and towels. There is only one decorative mirror in the bedroom,  and it is a little hard to use. It would be super easy to add a small mirror in the bathroom. <br/>Laura and Arjan gave us excellent  suggestions on activities. <br/>This apartment is a perfect place to  return to from an active day in the city. The location is in a quiet neighborhood but close enough to walk to the central train station in 15 to 20 minutes. Also very close to tram nr 3 to reach the museums. <br/>Laura and Arjan were wonderful hosts! The best thing was the  delicious breakfast we had every day! Absolutely fantastic! We would return to Laura and Arjan in a heartbeat! An outstanding value!"
21155943,"PROS: welcoming host, location, transport, quiet area, small but tidy with the essentials, balcony was nice although too cold to use much at this time of year, 2 comfortable double beds in small apartment. CONS: narrow steep 4 flight staircase to reach apartment, small bathroom/wet room/toilet, WIFI was unavailable for unknown reason, had problems with mice (and our food!) at night. Overall nice place to stay in Amsterdam. "
21158254,Very very comfortable bed and fantastic location.Accomodation could benefit from a little more T.L.C. Corina kindly let us keep the room to fit in with our plane timetable. Thankyou Corina. We would stay again. 
21185032,"Me and two friends stayed with Olaf over New Years and we had an amazing time in Amsterdam with a great AirBnB experience. Olaf was a generous host, made sure we had everything we needed and provided us with information on how to get around Amsterdam. The flat was exactly as described with an awesome rooftop terrace. We stayed in two separate rooms with three people, we were able to cook in the kitchen (which had everything you could ask for) and could use everything in this house."
21193205,"The houseboat was everything I had hoped for. Bop and Eef were so friendly and have a great sense of humor. The bed was extremely comfortable. We had such a great time in Amsterdam and having this truly lovely house boat to come home to was fantastic. Kitchen had everything we needed, very clean, amenities galore. The boat deck is great for morning mimosas with a view! Short walk to the tram made getting around  super easy. I would stay here again any day!"
21193701,"Hôte vraiment parfait.  Un endroit charmant, une hôtesse de qualité, meilleur qu'à l'hôtel. Je recommande Marga et sa famille qui m'ont fait passer un bon moment, dans une chambre chaleureuse. Je n'hésiterait pas une seconde à retourner à cet endroit pour un séjour à Amsterdam ou pour une nuit entre deux avions.  Endroit près de la vieille ville. J'ai aussi bien aimé la disponibilité du vélo et du transport à l'aéroport fourni par Marga pour un coût vraiment abordable.  AAA."
21197401,We had a beautiful weekend in Amsterdam and a pleasant stay in Gabriel & Marloes apartment. It is really close to the tram station and it only takes about 20 minutes to the center city. <br/>We enjoyed our stay to the full!<br/>
21212836,"Nous avons passé 2 magnifiques jours à Amsterdam, grâce à l'hospitalité unique de Sonja sur le Tasmania ! Tout est fait pour se sentir à l'aise, la chambre est très agréable, les petits détails d'accueil font le plus ! A recommander pour une expérience hors du commun !"
21223936,Alles wunderbar! Besten Dank für die tolle Möglichkeit bei euch zu übernachten.
21223991,"Ik heb een super tof verblijf gehad bij Simone! Mooi, gezellig huis in groene omgeving, alle comfort en daarbovenop nog eens 2 hele gezellige avonden met haar doorgebracht.<br/>Bedankt Simone! "
21245084,"<br/>I and my friend stayed at Anne Marie's over the weekend and I have to say that the place looked quite nice in pictures except for the bathroom but when I read that she had renovated it, we decided to take a chance and go with it. To begin with Anne-Marie did give us specific instructions on how to get to the place which was good and we appreciated it. After getting there, the living room is as it looks in the pictures which is nice except there was dust on the lamps and the floor and didn't feel very clean so clearly a lack of effort on the part of the host there. The kitchen was fully equipped on the bright side. The bathroom though was unfortunately worse than we had thought... The bathroom didn't even have a door to it and as mentioned here the toilet is seperate where the flush doesn't work unless you press really hard into it. The tap was leaking all of the 2 days that we were there. The first day there was hot water but the next day it was freezing cold water such that there was no way we could've showered and we called Anne marie 4-5 times at an interval of 20-30 minutes between each call to ask about the hot water but she did not answer at all and then called back when we were already checked out and at he airport so clearly no marks for promptness there. Also the lock on the main door is faulty. One of the nights we literally had to tackle it for 10 minutes before it finally gave in and opened. She does mention that the apartment in on the fourth floor but I don't think it has been mentioned there's six flights of very steep stairs so Incase you have big suitcases I don't see how it's possible to take them up yourself. We did not meet Anne marie herself and picked up the keys from beans and bagels which despite all of my qualms is a very nice spot. Overall, for the price that we were charged which was about 85 GBP per night, it was a very dissatisfying experience and I would not recommend it or stay here again as I personally have stayed at much better b&bs before where the hosts actually put in an effort to make the guests feel comfortable and not just rip them off because quite frankly this is what it felt like. Amsterdam in itself is such a beautiful city with such an amazing vibe so I would recommend you look elsewhere instead of this place so as to not dampen the experience at all. This place and the unavailability of the host is just not worth the money I paid. "
21255856,"Das Zimmer von Maike und Caspar war sehr nett. Auch die Möglichkeit, mit der Mikrowelle und dem Wasserkocher zwischendurch eine kleine Malzeit zuzubereiten, ist sehr prkatisch. Die Lage des Hauses fanden wir sehr gut. Die Entfernung zum Zentrum ist wirklich nicht allzu groß und die Ruhe in der netten Nachbarschaft ein angenehmer Kontrast zur quirligen City. Wirlich toll war auch das leckere Frühstück mit dem frischen Obst! Wir denken, dass die Unterkunft gerade im Sommer ein Traum sein muss, und wir kommen gerne wieder  :)<br/>"
21259303,"Ro was a gracious host with his beautiful apartment right on one of the grand canals of Amsterdam. As an authentic Amsterdam house, the apartment is on the 3rd and 4th floors of a 1600s building with a traditional tightly spiraled staircase. Ro has done everything he can to prepare the apartment for guests and even stocked the fridge with beers, water and some fresh food - greatly appreciated. The main bedroom is a loft queen sized bed tightly nestled in the eves of the roofline. Downstairs in the main apartment are two small rooms and a bathroom that is modern and very serviceable. Washer is helpful to have for those staying more than a few days. The neighborhood is fun and lively and again authentic Amsterdam for those seeking a true in-City experience. I would definitely return to this apartment.  Thank you for a great stay! The apartment was lovely and as pictured. Big windows, lots of light, and a little balcony for some fresh air.  The neighborhood was great-  with little stores all over and a little park nearby. Found a fantastic coffee shop (de koffiesalon centrum) and cafe for lunch within a block as well as a great place to rent bikes (Black Bikes). Everything was very clean and neat!  Enjoy Amsterdam!  - Nick and Christine"
21275790,"Staying at Corina's place was a great experience . It was clean , quiet, and the location was great, very close to everything we needed . Corina was a nice and kind host, thank you!"
21311719,"J'ai effectué un voyage de 4 jours à Amsterdam, pour moitié professionnel et pour moitié privé (en amoureux). <br/>Le B&B de David a été parfait du début à la fin. <br/>C'est un endroit calme, trendy et chaleureux. Il est parfaitement situé au centre de cette superbe ville. <br/>Le plus ? Le petit déjeuner dans la chambre ! Pyjama autorisé ;-)"
21312851,"Absolutely fabulous compact flat perfectly located away from the noisy tourists but close to the museums and a breeze to get to from the airport too. We were greeted by the delightful Lucie who gave us brilliant tips on important stuff like where to eat! Incidentally loads of great options where locals eat are nearby. We so wished we booked ahead to get in to  van  't spit - we walked in and saw & smelt amazing food but there was an hour wait. Drats! Next time!!!<br/>Our  family of 4 that included our 13 & 11 year olds absolutely loved the place. Sweet additional touches included: a lovely fruit bowl and sparkling water left for us as well as some drinks in the fridge. Lucie was available for any queries, left umbrellas to use too. The place was immaculately clean and had a great shower and compact but very practical bathroom. <br/>Frankly I don't really want people to be aware how good it is so that I can book it again easily ( hopefully!). Thanks so much for making our stay in Amsterdam so fantastic. I so hope we will be back! <br/>Btw - the photos do not do the place justice. It is even better in the flesh & the place now includes additional useful shelving in the bathroom, etc"
21314206,"Amsterdam is a great city and Edwin's guesthouse the perfect place to stay! It's super central, all locations you have to visit are really close cause you are right in the heart of amsterdam! It's just perfect. Edwin is a super host - friendly, sympathic and helpful even at nighttime :) It was a fantastic trip to amsterdam and there were no problems at all about the arrival/ check out or even the room, which was clean and friendly. All in all: it's all you need for a perfect stay at amsterdam and Edwin is a super host! I will come back soon. :)"
21324512,"The suit was simply amazing, I couldn't have found a better location, in the heart of Amsterdam within walking distance of everything. <br/>The apartment was beautiful, with all the amenities one might need, spacious, clean and so very charming. <br/>Job was super helpful and always there when I needed something, he was kind and very accommodating."
21325023,"My family (6 adults 3 children) and I had an absolutely magical time in Amsterdam in Minouks' wonderful apartment. It is an incredibly elegant and sophisticated home whilst being magically fun and surprisingly practical for children. <br/>It is perfectly located on a main canal close to pubs, bars, coffee shops, restaurants and supermarkets. I spent a lot of time just drinking coffee (from their amazing coffee machine!) looking out of the main windows and witnessing the activities taking place in and around the canals. <br/>As I said the apartment is an incredible space and Minouk is an incredible host. From the moment I booked Minouk gave me all the information I asked for plus such incredible maps, recommendations, local knowledge and contacts that became vital during our stay. She went above and beyond as far as I'm concerned. <br/>Minouk couldn't be there to greet us herself but a close family friend greeted us and showed us round and Minouk left plenty of contact details for people close to the apartment during our stay if there were any issues (there weren't!)<br/>We would all stay there again in a heartbeat!<br/>Thankyou so much Minouk."
21359184,"Wir haben uns sehr willkommen gefühlt mit einem kleinen Snack und zwei Piccolo-Rotwein :-) Das Zimmer ist sehr gemütlich und geschmackvoll. Geschirr, ein Wasserkocher, ein Kühlschrank u. Mikrowelle machen es möglich zu Frühstücken und Abendbrot zu essen. Das Bett war für mich ein bisschen zu weich - meine Tochter fand es prima. Andrea war sehr nett und hilfsbereit. Sie bietet einen wirklich zuvorkommenden Service. Eine optimale Unterkunft für einen Aufenthalt in Amsterdam!! Ich würde jederzeit wiederkommen."
21413211,"Tout était parfait, Mike est très accueillant, et disponible . On sent qu'il apprécie de rendre les séjours de ses hôtes agréables. L'appartement est magnifique, décoré avec beaucoup de gout et extrêmement propre. Le quartier est très paisible, vert, et proche de lieux parfaits pour boire un verre. en deux mots le séjour parfait . very nice week end at STEVIN and JOL everything was perfect<br/>Stevin and Joll were very available<br/>the boat is very nice and pleasant<br/>provided bicycles  are a big advantage<br/>thank you and may be in soon"
21413332,"Mycket fin och mysig lägenhet i ett bra och lugnt område. Vi promenerade därifrån kring hela stan och det funkade jättebra med läget på boendet. Allt som behövdes för att kunna bo fanns i lägenheten; köksredskap, basvaror, handdukar osv. Städat och fräscht. <br/>Väldigt trevliga och tillmötesgående värdar! Kan verkligen rekommendera detta boendet."
21434469,"Hans is a 10+ host. He gave us a lot of useful tips about Amsterdam, where to it, where to go and so on.<br/>The apartment was really nice & cosy, with really comfortable bed, big bathroom, nice small terrace and the coffee machine made our days every morning. The location is also great, easy to find & reach from the airport, close enough by foot from all the tourist attractions."
21435454,"We had a very good time at Lots lovely apartment. Lot made us feel totally at home, she left us some cava, the house was in good clean condition and the garden was just lovely. Also Lot has the cutest cat, that everyone would enjoy being around. The apartment is located in a very nice area in the city. It's in walking distance to the city center and closely located to nice cafés, restaurants and grocery stores. I can recommend everyone to stay at Lots :-)"
21445537,"We stayed for nearly a week to attend a business conference in Amsterdam.<br/>Simone is a wonderful host, we had everything we needed to concentrate on the conference.  The house is in a very quite area for Amsterdam, the room is perfect for our needs and we also enjoyed to sit in the small garden with a nice view on the nearby park.  <br/>We felt very welcome right form the beginning and everything just work out very smooth, uncomplicated and always with a smile ;-) Thanks and see you again-"
21479793,so  lovely cat!!! Clean and cozy room. Nice lord! Give you every detail you should know. Not far from old town.
21508529,"We stayed at Mikes apartment for 4 nights, really great location perfect size for two people. Mike was super hospitable and the place was decked out with everything you need for a comfortable stay.<br/>Centrally located but far enough away from the hustle and bustle of the center of town, great places to eat and shop locally, we would highly recommend staying here.<br/>Only one negative was it was a bit noisy from the apartment upstairs as you could hear every footstep quite loudly but understandable for staying in an old property.<br/>Five stars "
21512698,"S. was a lovely Host, She was very polite with us. Location is pretty convenient to the city centre. Sometimes The bathroom wasn't clean like we thougt. Naz, Her cat was very Nice And lovely. We had a good trip in Amsterdam, thanks to S. too."
21585407,"Laura and Arjan's apartment is cosy, well laid out, all the facilities you could possibly need and more, we felt secure and very comfortable here. We could of easily spent a day just relaxing in the apartment! <br/>The building is fantastic and a welcome break from boxy hotel rooms! <br/>The location is perfect, it's handy for the bus Routes to the centraal station and also walking distance into the city centre. <br/>Breakfast was delicious every morning, with fresh ingredients and little Easter treats for us!! I wouldn't like to spoil the suprise with more details. It's just Yummy!<br/>The hosts are warm, friendly and extremely helpful, with dining advice, transfers from the Airport and lending us their bikes and umbrella's for the spring weather. <br/>Could not recommended this family more as hosts, we would love to return!"
21588665,"Abbiamo trovato facilmente la casa partendo da piazza Dam e prendendo il tram nr. 9. Gli spazi a disposizione per me e la mia amica erano piccoli ma sufficienti per la durata di due notti, si presentano molto accoglienti. L'host mette a disposizione un cucinino molto pratico per la colazione, il letto è davvero comodo e la compagnia dei gatti è stata apprezzata. Toetsie è stata gentilissima e disponibile a rispondere a qualsiasi nostra richiesta, ci ha messo a disposizione due chiavi di casa, la sua bicicletta e delle cartine della città, del succo di frutta, del pane e delle marmellate per colazione, il tutto molto apprezzato! Consiglio assolutamente questo alloggio ad appena 15 minuti di tram dal centro per due giovani. Era la nostra prima volta ad Amsterdam e abbiamo apprezzato ogni cosa!"
21594254,"Everything perfect, cosy and warm! Beautiful place :)"
21611106,"Great location, great host and great room. I'd highly recommend this place, it's close to everything and I'd definitely book it again if I'm in Amsterdam."
21613602,Hein's quaint apartment was perfect for our quick Amsterdam stay! Everything you could want or need - very hospitable 
21614394,"What a delightful place! Well equipped with everything imaginable, this wonderful apartment is centrally located and within walking distance from the museums, grocer store, restaurants etc. Ingo and Marlies are very gracious hosts and have thought of every little detail."
21622328,"Hi we had THE most amazing time at Marijke's amazing flat. The place looks even more gorgeous in real life, and was really clean and homely feeling. Marijke gave us loads of information about the area and some fantastic recommendations for things to do and places to eat ( and we did ALL of them!) and really enjoyed ourselves. We were there for 6 nights and really go to explore the city and the local area. The local area is great and really vibrant. There are great bars and restaurants, a food street market, a huge warehouse complex with street food and shops and a cinema which we explored. We were also really fortunate to have great weather and experience Amsterdam over New Year - the fireworks and bangers were great! Marijke's friend Lara met us at the apartment to give us the keys and show us around, and was really sweet. We were unfortunately delayed by a couple of hours getting there but texted Lara and she was really nice about it and patently waited for us. She met us when we were leaving also so we could drop off the keys, all in a very timely manner which made the whole experience a total pleasure. We really hope to return to Amsterdam and definitely will be asking Marijke if we can stay there again! Over all - AMAZING. Highly recommend it!!! "
21635784,"This apartment is just beautiful! The location was great and is right by some good restaurants and bars and tourist things to do! It is also very close to the centre of town! <br/><br/>Constanze was wonderful and greeted us with Prosecco and treats. She had also researched good places for us to go out based on what we told her we liked which was so lovely of her! <br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this apartment and will be coming back to stay on my next visit to Amsterdam!"
21643560,"C'est une très jolie chambre, on se sent vite chez soi, et Mijef a tout prévu pour cela : son accueil est chaleureux, et elle est à la fois prévenante et discrète. Merci beaucoup  !<br/>Le quartier est calme, et proche du centre."
21657376,"Eva was away for the holidays but her friend Ravit was great. She greeted us at the entrance of the apartment and helped us lugged the bags up the stairs, explained things to us. The apartment is exactly as in the photos and there are milk and varieties of spice, it was quite easy to cook anything really. Supermarket at the corner, nice view, bagel place nearby, what more can you ask. Oh yes, we had to leave pretty early in the morning and Ravit was nice enough to bring some pastries which my son devoured. "
21663873,Nice studio in a great part of town.  Flat was at the top floor so a little precarious hauling a weeks worth of luggage up the narrow/steep stairs so worth considering when booking.  Was a nice bonus that we could leave luggage at iambnb office as we arrived in Amsterdam several hours before our official check in time.
21665612,"Overall we had a lovely stay in this wonderful houseboat! The location was excellent (a short walk into the centre of Amsterdam and close to many shops), the houseboat was clean and well kept, and it felt so special to be on a houseboat in Amsterdam, looking onto the canals and with ducks swimming up to the windows!! We stayed in winter, but I imagine it would be even better in summer when you could sit out on the deck. The only minor con that we experienced was that (apparently due to an issue with the laundry) there were no towels at all on our first night in the place and also no toilet paper or toiletries. Having just finished 24hrs of transit from Sydney, we desperately needed a shower, but wound up going out to buy the essentials and drying ourselves with t-shirts...not the most pleasant way to start our stay. When the towels did arrive, they were damp and there were no floor towels so water dripped everywhere. However, given how great all of the rest of our experiences were, I'm inclined to chalk this down to a one off, and would still recommend the stay overall."
21670630,"It was the perfect start for our europe trip. We are welcomed with a named board at airport in early morning. Arjan (laura's husband) also helped to drop us at city centre in an early morning. We were surprised with a big basket of breakfast every morning,  with freshly made croissants,  boiled eggs,  coffee and juice. We had a very long good sleep in a warm and spacious apartment. They are to us more than a host but a family. We couldn't ask for more.  Highly recommend everyone to stay with Laura's. We will definitely stay with them again if we visit amsterdam."
21681184,Joke was an amazing host. She went above and beyond to help us in any way possible. She was flexible with check-in and check-out times and provided an amazing breakfast each morning. She had great tips for exploring the city and had knowledge of what events were happening during our stay. She also offers transportation passes for easy and low cost travel. There is a tram stop right outside of her place for easy access throughout the city!<br/>The room looks as pictured and fit the three of us comfortably. I would recommend staying with Joke! 
21720140,"I really loved staying at at Marielle's. The location is great-<br/>close enough to walk everywhere; I never took public transport. The neighborhood is quiet and is near some restaurants and cafes as well as the grocery. Walking up the stairs is a challenge especially with a huge luggage; but the apartment is spacious and crisp & clean. I love the minimalist decor. Everything you need is provided and I felt so comfortable at the apartment. Marielle is so easy to talk to and replies uber fast! Whenever I ask her help re something, she delivers answers and options right away! Ideal host! Would definitely recommend and would stay again at this apartment. "
21739595,"Marga and Rico house is peaceful and inspiring, and conform to the description and photos. It gives a different view of amsterdam and how you can enjoy the city in a different way. I definitely recommend it!"
21742859,"Anne-Marie was amazing, and the house as well.<br/>She helped me a lot. The house is not too small, and really comfortable. <br/>I recommend to take a bike, the route from the Central Station to the house is wonderful! :-)"
21764011,"Excellente adresse.<br/>Nous sommes resté 4nuits, le centre ville est très accessible. <br/>L'appartement est vraiment agréable, bonne cuisine, belle douche et lit vraiment confortable. <br/>Le petit déjeuner est servi tous les matins et c'est plaisant! <br/>Un détail pour les personnes souhaitant faire des grasses matinées : on entend la vie de nos hôtes le matin. Ils vivent juste au dessus. <br/>Pas franchement gênant mais à savoir!<br/>Bonne continuation à nos charmants hôtes, toujours prêts à nous renseigner et rendre notre passage excellent ! <br/>Merci !!!"
21808712,"Our three night stay at Vibekes beautiful home was the first time we (my girlfriend and me) used Airbnb and it couln't have been better! Vibeke was very helpful (even before we arrived via messages) and welcomed us more than hospitable. She took her time to ask us if she could offer us anything, need any help or informations, gave us a city map and some helpful hints what she would recommend. Finally Vibeke offered to text her whenever we have further questions. - This kind of contact to locals is probably the biggest plus in not staying at a hostel or hotel or whatever!<br/>Her place is arranged in a loving 50ties style which makes it cozy and special. Our favorite piece was the one-of-one bed we slept in. The kitchen offered everything we needed and some delicious tees!<br/>Her apartment is located in a calm neighborhood but offers good connection to the Airport (about 20 minutes) and the city centre (less then 15 minutes). Supermarkets are available as well.<br/><br/>To cut a long story short: We can recommend Vibeke as a host and her place without any doubt. <br/>Thanks for having us and being so flexible and generous with our check-out!"
21817273,David was very welcoming and accommodating.
21841689,"Corina's room is a lovely spacious quiet room in Jordaan, perhaps the coolest neighbourhood in Amsterdam. You're close to everything you need. It is well supplied, the bed is comfy, and the shower is amazing. Corina is the perfect combination of friendly and helpful and yet giving her guests their space and privacy. I would stay here again and highly recommend it. "
21856481,"Staying at Corina's was an amazing experience. The room was very comfortable and well located. We were able to walk everywhere and didn't need any other transport. Corinne was very welcoming and full of information of local attractions and gave great tips on where to go and what to see during our short stay.<br/><br/>Thanks for everything Corina, we will definitely stay again next time we are in Amsterdam.<br/><br/>Greg and Maria"
21901815,"Superbe séjour à Amsterdam en famille, nos filles de 7 et 10 ans ont adoré dormir sur la péniche d egija pendant 3 nuits et pouvoir voir les canards et les cygnes dès le matin au petit déjeuner! Très propre, fonctionnel, calme, central, une hôte sympathique et ponctuelle! A recommander vivement!"
21903123,"The Garden house is great and cosy. Everything you need is provided plus additional welcome drinks, fruit and some snack. <br/>Hosts are extremely friendly and flexible there was no problem on very late arrival hours.<br/>We will definitely book this place again.  This was our 2nd stay at lovely Garden house. The place is just perfect, nice and cosy. I will definitely book again in the future."
21903232,"This was a perfect experience for us.  <br/><br/>Ingo greeted us as friends, gave us plenty of information about the area, and then left us alone to enjoy a couple of wonderful days in Amsterdam.  Location is perfect---everything within walking distance.<br/><br/>The spacious apartment has banks of windows looking out on the canal.  It is spotlessly clean, very stylish, with a fantastic kitchen, a very comfortable bed.  Everything high standards.<br/><br/>Thank you Ingo!"
21932431,"Andrea welcomed us personally into her home as soon as she got back. Her directions to get to her place were very clear, and she provided us with an entire binder of information upon our arrival. The room was spacious and clean with all (if not more) of the amenities one needs to feel at home. She is very proud of her city and wants to do everything she can to make sure you love it, too. Dank U wel, Andrea!"
21932991,Merkezi konumda ve şehrin birçok farklı noktasına yürüme mesafesinde. Tek odalı bir eve göre salonu ve mutfağı oldukça büyük. Muhteşem kanal manzarasına sahip.
21957386,"Marga and Rico are the nicest host I've met so far on Airbnb. They're friendly, warm and very welcoming. They made us feel right at home, and even picked us up at the station when we arrived, which was very kind! We stayed at their guesthouse for one night, and had a great time in Amsterdam. The guesthouse is so unique and cozy with a warm fireplace, very charming and definitely unlike other places you'll find in the city. This is a real gem! Would definitely recommend this place if your planning on visiting Amsterdam. "
21974940,"Marikje est une bonne hôte, accueillante et prête à vous fournir les informations qu'il vous manque pour profiter de votre séjour.<br/><br/>La chambre est telle que décrite dans l'annonce: spacieuse, lumineuse et pratique. Vous avez un petit réfrigérateur, un micro-onde ainsi qu'une bouilloire assortie de sachets de thé et de vaisselle à votre disposition.<br/><br/>La salle de bain est très fonctionnelle et agréable.<br/><br/>Nous n'avons pas eu le temps de faire plus ample connaissance avec Marijke mais il est certain que nous y reviendrons lors d'un prochain séjour!<br/><br/>Le quartier est très tranquille et il ne faut pas hésiter à y faire un petit tour. Prenez aussi le temps de dîner au Drover's Dog, un restaurant Australien où l'on mange très bien animé par une équipe des plus sympathique.<br/><br/>L'accès au transport est des plus simple: vous avez des bus et des trains à environs 5 minutes à pied pour vous rendre en moins de 10 minutes dans le centre ville. <br/>Si vous venez en voiture, nous vous recommandons d'utiliser le P+R de Zeeburg, qui est à 3 minutes de bus de chez Marijke. Faites cependant attention à bien garder votre ticket/reçu qui vous est délivré lors de votre arrivé.<br/><br/><br/>Nous souhaitons une bonne continuation à Marijke! Le petit studio de Michelle est un véritable petit havre de calme à quelques arrêts de tram du centre. Il ne vous faudra que 15 petites minutes pour vous rendre dans le coeur de la ville. Le quartier est très propre et calme et le logement plus propre que jamais! Tout est très bien pensé et l'on a beaucoup aimé la grande douche. Il y a une entrée privative permettant le respect de la vie privée de chacun. Michelle et Victor sont très chaleureux et accueillants (avis aux Français de passage chez eux, Victor se débrouille très bien en Français!). Ne pas hésiter une seule seconde avant de réserver. Il y a un super restaurant sur le bout de Steigereiland, le Café Vrijburcht avec de très bons plats assez raffinés. Merci à Michelle et Victor pour leur accueil."
22001930,"Ad & Anna sind sehr freundliche und hilfsbereite Gastgeber, die gerne helfen, den Aufenthalt so angenehm wie möglich zu gestalten. <br/>Das Studio ist schön und individuell eingerichtet. Es gibt eine Wand mit Stadtplan und zahlreichen Infos. Sogar persönlich zusammengestellte Tourenpläne liegen für die Gäste bereit.<br/>Die Lage des Studios ist ideal, man kommt schnell zu vielen Sehenswürdigkeiten und hat viele schöne Geschäfte, Cafés usw.  in der Nähe. Trotzdem ist es herrlich ruhig für einen erholsamen Schlaf. :)<br/>Sehr empfehlenswert! Auch bei unserem zweiter Besuch bei Ad & Anna haben wir uns sehr wohl gefühlt. Die Beiden sind wunderbare Gastgeber, man fühlt  sich willkommen."
22028918,"What a delightful place to stay! From a lovely welcome of iced lemon water on a warm day to a complementary bottle of wine in our apartment, one couldn't have asked for a better start! Breakfast was offered for the duration of our stay and it was divine, and unexpected! Laura was lovely and we met her husband, mother and children who were so friendly and made us feel like we had known them forever! <br/>The bed was big and comfortable and the shower the best I have had in 4 weeks of travelling!!!<br/>An easy walk of 15-20 mi s to downtown Amsterdam was lovely! A cute pub/ restaurant just 100metres walk away and a canal view that was so relaxing!!<br/>Can't thank you enough Laura, your home and apartment were a beautiful place to end our month long holiday! And thanks also for the ride to the airport, much appreciated! I will tell everyone I know who is heading to Amsterdam to come stay with you"
22054994,"You immediately see Olaf's passion around him- the apartment is covered in comics! The two rooms were very comfortable and the roof terrace very nice. Olaf gave us some good recommendations, including the excellent Ethiopian restaurant around the corner. He also offered us breakfast the next morning with some unique Dutch specialties. And of course coffee and stroopwaffles! Though we only stayed one night, I enjoyed the time and would recommend Olaf as a host!"
22058981,"Jeroen is a very nice guy and we enjoyed staying with him during the 6 nights we were there. <br/>The place is as it looks in the picture and it is very clean, with everything including TV, amazing books and a little fridge.<br/>The neighbourhood is not the best, but it is perfect for the price, and it is also 12-15mins by bus to Amsterdam central station. <br/>Jeroen himself also lives in the same building and he is always accessible in case of problems. For instance, we wanted an extra set of keys for the house and he provided us with that swiftly. <br/>However, it is worth mentioning that the room is cold(at least for my standard, and during autumn and winter) and there is a heater which is off mostly. We contacted Jeroen because of this problem repetitively but each time he turned it on for a little period and then it was off again. This was the only negative point that I had to mention. "
22063594,"This was our first time using Airbnb.  The system worked very well and we were very happy with our experience.  ""The Southern Comfort Town Home"" is in a great area which we enjoyed very much. All of the shops and restaurants are lovely and is close to a beautiful park and within walking distance to many attractions.  We found the house to be very much as it was described and it was great for our weekend.  Barbara, the manager, was very quick to respond to my e-mails and questions, which was greatly appreciated.  She brought a list of useful information with her with suggestions of restaurants and things to do and see.   Although the house is lovely and worked well for our needs, I'm not sure it would work well for families with young children or older adults, as the stairway to the second floor is extremely steep with very small stairs.   If a hairdryer is important for anyone, bring your own, as there isn't one there.  I had brought mine with me, but unfortunately, my adaptor (which had been purchased at the airport) was not working.   All in all we had a lovely stay."
22070923,"I'm so glad that Claire (Marga's daughter)hosted me for my first stop in Europe. <br/>Location: <br/>It is not far from the city center, but to go to the place by public transportation is not so convenient. After taking tram 4 from Centraal to Rai Station, there is 15mins walk to get to the other side of Amstel Canal. But if Marga is home(gone for vacation), she can drive you from centrael  Station. So, the location is not a problem especially with the bicycle at the place.<br/>Facility and atmosphere:<br/>The main house is a floating house on the water and the guest house is in the backyard with very good environment( trees, grass and flowers). The private room is cozy and simple while there's a lot of information/guide for Amsterdam. The main house is very bright and simple with a really cute cat in it.<br/>People: luckily I have talked to Marga, Claire, Claire's boyfriend and her uncle.<br/>They are all super hospitable and nice. I really feel comfortable, free and like home.<br/>I would definitely recommend this place in terms of its price, location and especially the people!"
22114315,"We had such a nice time at Marloes & Gabriel´s place. The apartment was clean and very cosy. They offered us tea, coffee, shower stuff, bikes for free and also the transfer to the tram station. The whole family was very friendly and we really want to come back again.  Thanks for such a nice stay in Amsterdam. "
22115532,"Estuve con mi esposo en Noviembre del 2014 y nos gusto mucho, la habitación está bien ubicada, es muy fácil encontrar la dirección, la cama es cómoda, grande, el baño es iluminado, la limpieza excelente!  Debby muy buena anfitriona, esta dispuesta a colaborar , es muy amable."
22123461,Goede slaap plek na een avondje uit in de Arena. Uurtje  later uitchecken geen enkel probleem. Simone bedankt voor de gastvrijheid
22131700,"L'accoglienza era affidata a un amico di Marie che è stato puntuale e disponibile ad attenderci all'ora concordata. Abbiamo trovato la casa pulita, ordinata e ben riscaldata, accogliente, attrezzata di tutto l'occorrente. Le foto sono molto rispondenti alla realtà. Molto vicina la fermata al tram n° 2 che porta direttamente ai musei e al centro città. Consigliamo a tutti di godere di questa abitazione che ospita comodamente 4 persone anche se bisogna condividere il bagno al primo piano, al quale si accede passando per una camera da letto, dato che al pianterreno c'è solo un servizio con acqua fredda. Ci è parso strano il bagno completamente  ""vetrato"" verso la camera.<br/>"
22139959,"Lieber David,<br/><br/>vielen Dank! Wir haben uns in Ihrem Haus/Zimmer sehr wohlgefühlt. Die Beschreibung entsprach den Tatsachen. Das Zimmer war geräumig, lag zentral und war trotzdem ruhig. Ein zusätzliches Plus war das Frühstück und Ihre freundliche und zuvorkommende Art. Wir kommen gerne wieder.<br/><br/>Mit freundlichem Gruß<br/>Rainer und Marion"

22163240,"Very nice space in the centre of Amsterdam. Very cosy and comfortable interior. Everything you would need available and very spacious compared to other airbnb's in Amsterdam.<br/>Spotless, hygienic and overall very clean.<br/>Loads of nice bars, restaurants and stores in the direct neighborhood. <br/>The fantastic Vondelpark is just across the street. <br/>With a bike rental right next door this place is perfect to start discovering Amsterdam both for the typical tourist spots as well as the more alternative side Amsterdam has to offer.<br/>Jean-Paul and Lidia where the perfect hosts. Easy to reach during the booking process and during our stay in Amsterdam. Friendly, enthusiast and overall relaxed.<br/>Only remark is that the street could be a bit loud (cars, typical dutch scooter noise from time to time) on a friday night, but this is of course Amsterdam and not a rural village. Nothing that would bother you unless you would be looking for absolute peace and quite. (saturday and sunday mornings where very quite, so sleeping in wasn't an issue)<br/>Wouldn't hesitate to book again."
22175995,"My friend and I loved staying here with Anna and Biscuits, her cat. It is a beautiful place in a wonderful location. She is very accommodating and treated us like honoured guests. She helped us with getting to know her city and it was more helpful than any map or guide. This was by far one of our favourite airbnb locations out of all the locations we've visited. Anna and her room are a dream. <br/>P. S. Her spaghetti is to die for! "
22192990,"Matthijs and Francina's apartment was perfect. It was extremely clean. The bed and pillows were so soft. The bathroom smelled so fresh each time. The place was very quiet at night compared to the other areas. I hardly heard anyone walking by. The location was very very close to the tourist spots and very convenient. Matthijs met us, assisted us and gave us tips personally. He was adorable and gave us all the tips. They even offered laundry service. Its like a hotel experience but cleaner. We even got a selfie with Matthijs before leaving. I would definitely recommend to friends and come back next time I'm in Amsterdam. Thank you matthijs and francina."
22235147,"Vibeke is a great host! Very helpful and happy and kind! Her house was really cute, comfortable and warm located in a quiet neighbourhood! And it was very easy to everywhere (the airport, the city center)! We really enjoyed our stay there! :D"
22240424,Maria ist eine sehr unkomplizierte und warmherzige Gastgeberin. Sie ist sehr hilfreich bei allen Fragen und Problemen. Ich habe mich von der ersten Minute an willkommen gefühlt und werde sehr gerne einmal wieder ihre Gastfreundschaft in Anspruch nehmen. Es waren ganz besondere und ganz schöne Tage mit ihr und ihrer netten Familie. Vielen Dank noch einmal für alles!
22241310,"Our stay with Laura was an excellent end to our trip. Being tired and having a long travel day, they were in touch with us for the entire day to make sure our trip to the home was as easy as possible. The home was clean, and beautiful. On a canal, short walk from anything you'd like to see. We had a great stay, and the hosts couldn't be more accommodating. "
22280699,"Great vacation in an amazing apartment facing the Amsterdam canals. Ingo & Marlies were extremely nice and the apartment was impeccable. The kids loved it. <br/>Ingo was extremely reactive and each time I would send a message he would answer back with ideas and suggestions.<br/>Thanks and see you soon."
22294379,"Nice part of Amsterdam, close to Central Station by tram n°9<br/>Very nice room with a comfortable bed<br/>Host's kindness; Thanks a lot"
22327090,"Joke always has good tips about Amsterdam around! Gerard always feed you up with good food and wine! The house is very beautiful, clean and comfortable. I enjoyed every morning, just opened my eyes could see the lovely birds on the water. I even could pictured with the swans! The neighbourhood is lovely too. Very lucky I could try the dutch ""cha siu"" from their very friendly neighbour! In short, staying here like at home all the times. A real airbnb recommended. Definitely will bring my hubby next time!"
22338876,very well
22356318,"I felt well-recieved by Margas welcoming character. Immediately I felt at home very much in the garden house. <br/>To stay in a place of such open minded and seasoned hosts, as Marga and her lovely family is a very precious experience to me. "
22360387,"Such a lovely unique place to stay while in Amsterdam. Me & boyfriend absolutely loved it!! Warm, spacious, lovely hot shower, the bed was SO comfortable (I miss it) <br/>Karin was soo friendly, let us know where good to eat and explore. 2 bikes to use as well! <br/>Really didn't want to leave! 100% recommend to anyone."
22384645,"Rosie is really friendly, the place is really convenient, really close to the tramway station! There's a really nice café Coffee company just right at the corner. And the neighborhood is super safe and quite. "
22398287,"Le bateau est propre et conforme à la description.<br/>Aucune attention d'accueil particulière. <br/>Le petit village constitué par les house boats est sympa, mais très proche de l'autoroute et de la voie ferrée, ce qui n'est pas mentionné.<br/>Suite à un problème de clefs (vite réglé), j'ai laissé deux messages sur le répondeur du propriétaire, il ne m'a jamais rappelé pour s'assurer que tout allait bien. "
22417220,This room was so lovely and well appointed! David has thought of everything. The room is exactly as it appears in the photos and complimented by a welcoming and attentive host. The home is well located within a few minutes walk of Amsterdam Central train station and city bus and tram services. Thank you David for making our stay in Amsterdam so great!
22428204,I really enjoyed my stay at Casa Vrolik. Toetsie is the perfect host. Since my reservation she was always here to assist me with replying my answering regarding my arrival. It was my first Airbnb trip and this has really reassured me.  I also loved the quiet and feel safe area with the park nearby located around 10 minutes by tram from the center. I only stayed for one night but she was here to welcome me warmly with a complementary package of nice stuff like a bottle of wine. She was also keen to deliver me information about my stay in Amsterdam. I would highly recommend her house. My trip would not have been the same at another place. 
22447506,Robert and Anke Apt is wonderful! The apt is equipped with everything we needed. The kitchen and the bathroom are very clean and new.  Robert has prepared many recommendations of restaurants and attractions for   us and kept in touch through our visit to check we have everything we need. 
22448824,"Great host. Left lots of food for us as we arrived late after a long trip. Easy to get a tram to the centre. <br/>"
22481130,"Dès l'aéroport ou  notre hote  est venu nous chercher , nous nous sommes sentis attendus et accueillis avec beaucoup de sincérité . La suite a confirmé que nous avions effectué le bon choix : somptueux petit déjeuner , logement agréable , des hotes très attentifs et trés sympathiques . Bref , faire le bon choix à AMSTERDAM c'est choisir LAURA et ARJAN ( je ne suis pas sur de l'orthographe )"
22486766,"Accomodatizione stupenda! Idromassaggio, giardino, 3 stanze, TV, giardino, cosa chiedere di piú?<br/>Distanza dal centro molto ravvicinata"
22494855,"Nous avons passé un séjour très agréable dans l'appartement spacieux et bien équipé. A noter que la literie est au top !! C'est très bien situé à environ 10-15 minutes de la gare et du centre à pied, dans un quartier résidentiel très calme et plein de charme. Laura et son mari sont adorables et disponibles pour toute question. Quel plaisir d'avoir un petit déjeuner aussi frais et copieux servi avec le sourire tous les matins. Encore merci, nous recommandons vivement !!"
22533343,"Mieke is a great host; she greeted us and made sure we had everything we need. She suggested cool places to visit. The room is like it is in the pictures, nice and bright. The apartment is clean. We had a good stay!"
22536881,"Great host, offering a very comfy room right in the centre.<br/>Listing had all I needed for a quick weekend stop in Amsterdam.<br/>Had a really enjoyable stay at Edwin's."
22544918,"I came to Amsterdam as a guest of a film festival and had originally booked a different listing. Unfortunately, when I showed up, there was a mistake and I wasn't able to stay! Without an accommodation, I called the AirBnB customer service line and the representative helped me find a new place. Klaartje was my guardian angel that night- she was able to host me at literally the last minute because of the previous mix-up. She was very kind, welcoming, patient, and understanding. She gave me everything I needed and suggested many wonderful places for food and such. (I'm a big fan of Bird, now!)<br/><br/>The room was lovely and did just the trick. The bed is very big, nice, and warm, and the windows at the foot of the bed were great for letting in the sunshine in the mornings to help wake me up. There is a shower and sink right around the corner and a small room with lovely tea, coffee, and amenities. Also, Klaartje is a talented artist and her prints, paintings, and drawings adorn the walls.<br/><br/>The neighbourhood, De Pijp (""pipe""), is very cool and quiet. There are many great cafes and shops on the main street, and the house is very close to the tram which will take you to Amsterdam Central Station in under half an hour. It's a lovely ride through the city, too.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend Klaartje and her lovely home if you're looking for a warm and comfortable place to stay in Amsterdam! "
22552997,Fun experience living with tin tin and Micky! Nice neighborhood with lots of bars and cafes close by. Rooftop was also fantastic! Olaf made us feel at home immediately with his warm hospitality and we thanked him for a good stay we've enjoyed! 
22577577,"Let's start with the positive sides: Corina is really nice and welcoming. She gave us useful tips and advices. <br/>About the location - it is the best!! Really really sweet neighborhood with lots of cool stuff to do.  <br/>The part that was a bit disappointing for us was the room. It doesn't look as amazing as the pics. Maybe the host took those photos a while ago because we think it might looked like this in the past, but now it's not as nice and lovely as it seems. Especially the yard, it looks abandoned! There's a problem with the water in the shower- nothing stops them from running all over the floor so be ready to clean them after you take a shower. <br/>One more thing- Corina is very strict about check-in & out time, and showed no consideration at all. Though our flight was late in the evening and the next guests was supposed to come only few hours later. But she did let us store the luggage, so that was a comfort…. <br/>The bottom line is – it's NOT worth the money.   <br/>"
22584738,"Hein was a very good host, really welcoming, he did everything to make our stay comfortable. He gave us a lot of information and tips about Amsterdam, which was so welcomed ! The studio was clean, quite small but perfect for a short stay. We loved the interior decoration, with a few allusions to the Netherlands ;)<br/><br/>"
22599426,"The house is in a beautiful area just by the Concertgebouw and the big museums.  The road is very quiet while also being central. One can walk into town or get trams (for instance there is a direct one to the Central Station if arriving by train).  The house is where Marlous and Michiel live with their young family most of the time and so it is very fully equipped with high quality furnishings (ie not a rental property).  <br/><br/>Communication with Marlous was excellent.  We were welcomed by the housekeeper (since Marlous and family were on holiday) who was there when we arrived at the house and showed us around.  There are very detailed instructions on how to use things as well as helpful suggestions (and maps) for restaurants and sightseeing.<br/><br/>We would strongly recommend the house."
22613727,"Worth the price.<br/>Great location, S was very nice to us, and her lovely cat was fun.<br/>The only problem is that you can't lock the bathroom door which is pretty sucks.<br/>Very good experience after all.<br/><br/>"
22672062,"Hein has a lot of energy and ideas. We were very well welcomed and hosted.<br/>It was a pleasure to meet him.<br/>The flat seems small but there is everything you need and even more! <br/>Do not hesitate to spend time there.<br/>"
22688546,"Het was heel fijn om in de prachtige oase van Marga en haar familie aan het water te kunnen verblijven. Ook de ontvangst verliep hartelijk en aangenaam losjes,  via haar dochter en de mails en briefjes in het huis. Ik kom graag nog eens terug voor langer, groeten, Ine"
22689375,"Lovely appartment located in a close distance to the city center. We did enjoy staying there. Gert is a very helpful person. He replied to my messages very quickly. We want to come back to Amsterdam and will stay at Gert's place once again. <br/>Best, <br/>Ewa"
22697989,"This was the second airbnb Iv'e stayed at, and I must say I was impressed with how everything went. Christopher was a great host, and did his best to try to make everything as easy as possible for me. Everything on the listing was completely accurate. I noticed his place on the airbnb site because the price was reasonable and booked it within 5 minutes after skimming through the listing and reviews; it just looked right and I was not disappointed. The location was very accessible to transportation, but I usually walked to and from the city center which was only about 45 minutes each way. The local neighborhood was very pleasant as well with plenty of cafes, bars, etc. As it was my first time in Amsterdam, I was very happy to have an easy place to stay.<br/><br/>Christopher was good company, which is great to have when you're spending a number of days in the same apartment. I could ask him about anything concerning the city, as well as anything I needed for staying at his place. Everything was well provided though, so I don't think I ever needed anything extra. The great thing was that he made sure I was very comfortable there.<br/><br/>I would definitely stay there again if available when I find myself going back to Amsterdam."
22699877,"We had a great time in this place! It was very clean, comfortable, and well-heated. Karen was friendly and gave us a very helpful guide to the area, as well as a lot of amenities and kitchen essentials. It was not far from public transport stops but we had no problem riding bikes into the city from here. A very nice place to stay, we would recommend. "
22704706,"This is a home-like home, quiet location makes me feel the local life, I love Rosie Gianni, like love my mother, she gave me a home-like warmth, next time if I go back to Amsterdam I will live in this beautiful place, thanks!"
22717959,"Wanka made us feel welcome during the entirety of our trip! When we first arrived at Amsterdam Central, Wanka picked us up in his car and drove us to his adorable and spacious apartment. Clean towels and bathroom necessities were provided along with wifi. Wanka also made us a delicious authentic Amsterdam dinner and spaghetti and meatballs. Saturday night, Wanka got us into a sold out FOX Halloween party for free. Sunday morning his connections allowed us to skip the 3 hour line and get in for free at the Anne Frank house. Wanka again drove us back to Amsterdam Central and we sadly had to leave the beautiful city of Amsterdam. Wanka was an amazing host and i would recommend him to everyone wishing to stay in Amsterdam!"
22741319,"The location for this room was perfect and it was also very clean. The host was extremely friendly and very helpful with directions, taxis, etc...I would definitely come back and stay here again."
22756714,"Cozy, comfortable and spacious private room in the middle of a beautiful and quiet garden. Marga and Rico are wonderful hosts, friendly to talk to, accommodating and insightful in regards to the city. I recommend this listing to anyone wanting a quiet place away from the busy centre. I suggest renting a bike, as it is the perfect way to get to and from."
22767303,"Points positifs: appartement à l ouest de jordaan, bien situé ,chambre correcte.<br/>Points négatifs: S. N a pas vraiment été accueillante et nous avons été très peu à l aise dans ce logement pour plusieurs raisons: rare échange ou communication avec elle, prostrée dans son lit quelque soit l heure de la journée, ou appartement vide mais ouvert?!<br/>l appartement était relativement sale et mal rangé ( et ceci pas ponctuellement : les poubelles pleines débordantes sont restée pendant 5jours ,une sur le balcon une ,dans la cuisine, tout comme les restes de bières et repas fast-food ...) , odeur de tabac froid persistant dans le salon et la cuisine.<br/><br/>Nous avons fait beaucoup de CS et la relation entre les personnes est assez importante pour nous meme si les hôtes ont une vie et sont peu disponibles. quelle déception de n avoir meme pas ete invité à s asseoir dans le canapé en arrivant pour discuter 5 min. "
22771508,It was really good experience for us. Elmar's floor is comfortable and good location that near the Erasmuspark. He answered assiduously our all questions. He is the best host !
22772127,"From the beginning to the end everything was fine. Had such a nice stay there and I can really recommend it.<br/>The apartment's location is perfect to discover the city. No noises or anything else will bother you there.<br/>Will definitely come back as soon as possible."
22800406,"Joris was great from the beginning; he was quick to reply back with available dates, and accommodating to our arrival times and departure times. He also had a great welcome package for us! (stroopwafles, tea, wine, snacks)<br/><br/>The apartment is exactly what you see in the pictures, and has a very comfy feel to it. <br/><br/>Location was great as well - everything seems to be just a 5-10 minute walk away, including the Albert Cuyp Market (one of the largest and busiest in Amsterdam).  "
22890316,"We stayed in Laura's place for 4 nights. We had a great time staying there. <br/>She was very nice and tried to help us with everything we needed. She has a lot of helpfull stuff and she knows the city very well.  Her studio apartment is nice and cozy. The apartment has everything you need. It located in a nice area of the city with a view to the canal. It really recommended for a vacation in Amsterdam.<br/>"
22895980,An excellent stay! Thank you Robert for such a lovely apartment in the most perfect location.  Appreciated the tips of what to do especially as during new year museums were very busy and we hadn't booked! <br/>We would definately stay next time in Amsterdam. 
22908266,"Very kind family. Picked us at the bus stop and dropped near ferry which was a long ride and was very helpful. However, had we known the fact that it's far away from the bus stop and not accessible by public transportation we wouldn't have chosen this unit."
22942072,"Fenno war ein super Gastgeber. Sehr hilfsbereit und freundlich. Er hat uns viele Tipps gegeben und war flexibel, was die Schlüsselübergabe anging. Die Wohnung war ebenfalls super - sehr gemütlich, groß genug für drei Leute und man durfte alles benutzen, was darin steht. Die Lage ist auch top, es gibt eine Bus- und Tramhaltestelle fast vor der Tür und bis zum Jordan sind es auch nur 10 Minuten zu Fuß. Einziger Haken: Die Dusche ist im Schlafzimmer."
22957407,"We had a wonderful weekend at Davids apartment. It is so well located, close to central station, and although it is in the heart of the red light district it is calm and we always felt safe. You can explore everything via walking. The view from the room is stunning: you look directly on the water. The bed is comfy, the bath as well. We even had fresh fruit and water. We felt in love in the second we entered the room and for sure with Amsterdam!<br/>I can fully recommend the apartment and would like to thank David for the nice communication."
22957737,"Nice apartment, good check in.  Extremely helpful about the area.  Like most places in Amsterdam, it is up a narrow staircase - but it is worth the climb."
22958410,Great stay! Very neat and tidy! Great location! Will return here next time for sure! 
22964546,"We had a GREAT weekend in Jeau-Paul and Lidia's appartment.<br/>very well furnished, ideally located next to a wonderfull park.<br/>Jeau-Paul and Lidia let us plenty of nice attentions (cool bars  and restaurants' adresses, chocolate eggs for Easter, etc!)<br/>Thank you very much.<br/>Don't hesitate one second to chose them for your stay in Amsterdam<br/><br/>The area around the flat is very nice with chill out bars and eveything you need.<br/><br/>Thanks again<br/><br/>Julia and her friends"
22976485,"This is by far one of the best flats we have ever stayed at. The host was personable, welcoming and very helpful. The flat itself was beautiful and spotless. It was in a quiet and safe neighbourhood within walking distance (20 minutes) of the train station and the main town centre. Very impressive. "
22994567,"Helga and Theo were amazing and very kind hosts, the apartment was great and cosy, their houseboat is great. The beautiful park Bos is near, train station only 10 minutes away by feet, Helga was great at providing indications. The overall experience was 1A and I can only recommend this listing. This was the second time I stayed at Helga & Theo's houseboat. Everything was great and pleasant, as always, it is really a very beautiful, confortable and quiet apartment and both Helga and Theo are great hosts. Highly recommended. Our stay at Helga & Theo's apartment was great, as always. They are very kind, great hosts and the stay at such a nice and calm apt. is always a pleasure. Highly recommended.  As this was the fourth time I stayed at Helga and Theo's houseboat, there's not much I need to say. It was great as always. They are great hosts, the apartment is beautiful, clean and exactly as described, the location is perfect for a more relaxed experience of Amsterdam. Highly recommended."
23019659,Best experience since a loooong time! Grietje and her husband were so friendly and staying with my friends at her boat was amazing and so relaxing!
23073751,A great host that has a immaculate clean house in a Fantastic location.   
23081445,"This was an absolutely amazing experience! The space was beautiful, in the perfect location and before we even arrived. Diewert and his family made us feel right at home. We were welcomed with maps, guidebooks, recommendations and everything else we would possibly need for a fabulous vacation."
23082978,Peter has been the most lovely host. We got a good night sleep & were provided with breakfast. The apartment is located in the very  center of Amsterdam & allows you to explore the city by foot. Totally recommend staying at Peters!
23111556,"Debby is a wonderful host.  She accommodated our dire need to have a rest after a gruelling flight and large time zone change prior to the agreed upon time.  The suite is well equipped.  All accessories are well thought out.  She gave us good advice as to sights, restaurants and public transportation.  The only problem encountered was a faulty Italian coffee maker.  <br/><br/>The suite is located on the second floor and is accessible via a curving staircase.  It is fairly narrow and steep as in most Amsterdam houses. <br/><br/>The location is within walking distance of the museum district as well as the Conzertgebow (spelling?).  The remaining city is accessible via a broad range of public transports.<br/><br/> "
23145375,"The house was really comfortable and all the furniture was almost new. It was a bit small for 4 people, but we had a great time. The location and neighbourhood are great. Everything went really well and we had a great trip."
23190233,"Toetsie offers a chance to experience a beautifully quiet area of Amsterdam, just outside the centrum.  Her shared space is warm and comfortable and in the spirit of a true B&B."
23204353,"Martijn was a dream host!  We booked his place on short notice and he went above and beyond what we could have asked for.  Unfortunately he was out of town when we arrived so we never got to meet him but he had his 2 wonderful friends meet us and help us get situated.  Prior to arriving, Martijn sent us a step by step guide to getting to the apartment which was very much appreciated and he and his friend made themselves very accessible to us if we needed anything or had any questions about the apartment or just recommendations on what to do in Amsterdam.  The apartment itself was beautiful and everything was absolutely perfect!  And public transport was just a very short walk from the apartment, so getting around Amsterdam was very easy.  The neighborhood is safe, wonderful and filled with fantastic restaurants; we had the best falafel sandwiches there!  This place is truly a gem and I cannot say enough great things about Martijn or his place.  I hope to stay here again on my next adventure in Amsterdam!  Thank you so much Martijn for everything!"
23215303,"Corina is a wonderful host & person. She welcomed us so warmly and has always been so helpful. The room is nicely decorated and fully equipped including a fancy shower, a fancy electric fireplace, fridge, adjustable beds, reading lights, coffee&tea machines and a tiny lovely garden. Room was very silent and quite warm. We had a comfortable stay. On top of all the location of the room is excellent! Jordaan is an elegant district and room is very close to main attractions including Rijksmuseum. We enjoyed lovely Corina's hospitality and her wonderful house. We felt like home and we will definitely miss it... Thank you Corina :)"
23216237,"We thoroughly enjoyed our two-nights stay in Peter's houseboat. A genuinely unique experience in Amsterdam. Small quarters, naturally, but the space was very well-appointed, with robes, coffee, fridge, and stove. Close to all the attractions. "
23239195,"We had an absolute fabulous time at Brendas beautiful appartment. Everything, from the booking till our leaving Amsterdam went smooth and very friendly. Brenda is a great host and made our trip as comfortable as possible. The apparment was nice prepared, even with fresh flowers. Brenda made everything easy for us, so we could use their coffee and spices. And there is also the possibility to use the washer and dryer.<br/><br/>The appartment is located in a familiy neighborhood with a huge playground near by and lots of possibilities to eat out, do groceries shopping or go to the park. Also the apparment is near the tram station. So you will be at Central Station in less than 20 minutes. Brendas appartment is very beautiful decorated and yet funcational with kids. There is a huge roof terrace where you can just hang out or enjoy a drink in the evening. The highlight for our kids were the two cats. So all in all it was a great trip for us and we are very happy that we had the possiblity to stay in this appartment. "
23243613,Grietje was a wonderful host. The boat was beautiful and well sized. Perfect for a group. Grietje was very helpful! The perfect host!
23252805,"it is a great stay in Sjoukje' flat!!! In addition to the tidy room, convenient location, what the most important is that Sjoukje is so kind to give all information about the city she knew . I am a little pity about missing the dinner she invited us,hope next time we will have such a chance to have meal together!!!"
23282041,"Aangezien de eerste keer mij zo goed was bevallen, koos ik opnieuw voor BBBellamy lovely central place! Debby gaf mij bij binnenkomst een aantal updates over de kamer en wat tips over de faciliteiten in de buurt. Een rondleiding was niet meer nodig... lekker makkelijk voor ons beiden. Leuk was om te zien dat ze een aantal zaken had toegevoegd in de kamer, zoals luxaflex en een plank voor boven het bad (erg handig)! Ik heb dankbaar gebruik gemaakt van het kleine filter koffiezetapparaatje, opdat ik mijn eigen koffie kon drinken. Zowel het bed als bad (+ eigen DVD = genieten) lagen weer fijn. Omdat ik hier voor de tweede keer was, kon ik nog eens nader al het moois in de Hallen ervaren. En ook weer lekkernijen op de markt vlakbij kopen! Voor de filmhallen kreeg ik nog een goede tip van Debby, welke ik kon bevestigen. Alles bij elkaar genomen wederom een prettige ervaring!"
23301321,"Prima Locatie en een hartelijk welkom met een bos bloemen<br/>Locatie is heel centraal gelegen, in principe kun je alles te voet doen!<br/><br/>De ruimte, douche en toilet alles keurig in orde"

We were welcomed with coffee, tea and wine which was very much appreciated.

23345857,"Laura y yo estamos encantados de habernos quedado durante tres días en casa de Marc con su familia!<br/>A pesar de que al llegar Marc no estuviera en casa debido a una reunión, su mujer Ellen nos recibió maravillosamente. Nos mostró nuestra habitación y baño privados con mucho detalle y atención, preocupándose porque no nos quedaran dudas por resolver. Igualmente, estuvo dispuesta en todo momento a ayudarnos si teníamos cualquier duda sobre la ciudad o los lugares a visitar.<br/>Al entrar en la casa, Laura y yo nos quedamos encantados con nuestra habitación. Recogida, limpia, amplia y, sobre todo, muy luminosa, es perfecta para pasar un largo fin de semana. Asimismo, el baño no dista mucho del que puedas encontrar en un buen hotel, prácticamente perfecto. Todo ello se encuentra ubicado en una zona de la casa que está separada de las zonas comunes habituales, ofreciendo la privacidad necesaria para sentirte como en casa.<br/>En cuanto a la casa se encuentra en un vecindario casi idílico, a dos minutos caminando de la parada del tranvía y a quince minutos de Centraal Station.<br/>Por último, Marc, Ellen y sus hijos, se esforzaron por hacernos sentir como en casa, desayunando con nosotros e informándonos de todo lo necesario para que nos fuera lo más cómoda posible nuestra vivista a Amsterdam. Tuve incluso la oportunidad de probar una de las fresas que su hijo tiene plantadas en su jardín:)!<br/>Muchas gracias por todo chicos, espero que nos volvamos a ver pronto!!<br/><br/><br/>"
23358178,"I can't say enough about this place. Let me start with the room. The room is set up nicely with the table to eat breakfast a refrigerator and even a TV. It was very clean and a lot of attention to detail in the room , you could see it.  The location was magnificent. It's located on one of the older more narrow parts of the canal where the canal has an intersection on one side and a quintessential bridge on the other. And our favorite place to eat (Texel) was right next to our door. With the Church of St Nicolaas in the background, it just doesn't get any better than this. Not to mention that it's a short walk to or from central station. David couldn't be nicer and more attentive. I hope we get another chance to go here.  The fact that you're inside a fully operational 17th century windmill is pretty amazing. Roel is a very nice fellow and I felt very comfortable talking to him. I felt like we would be friends if I was lucky enough to live there. The room was comfortable and we slept well there. It's easy to get there from the airport by bus. If you want to stay away from the crowds in the city, the setting and location are nice. "
23381727,"La casa de Jeroen era exactamente como en las fotografías y sus comentarios. En un barrio muy tranquilo y cerca de supermercados y restaurantes.  Estuvimos muy cómodos y nos encanto todo de la casa, cocina, salón, baño, cama.....<br/>Esta a 20 minutos del centro de Amsterdam en tranvía y suelen pasar cada cinco minutos +-.<br/>No conocimos a Jeroen pero nos atendió su hermana y no tuvimos ningún problema ni en la entrada ni en la salida.

23387585,"The apartment was just as nice as in the pictures. Beautifully furnished and very comfy : the bed was great and so was the table and chairs for breakfast (coffee capsules were offered for the Nespresso coffee machine to be used by the visitors + typical dutch waffles - loved them - by Debby).<br/>Not to mention the lovely neighborhood and street. It is within walking distance from Tramway n°17 (5 minutes at the most), and not far away at all from the city center : about 15 minutes.<br/>Excellent value for money.<br/>Would definitely go back there and highly recommend it."
23393999,"Wilbert was an excellent host - he's a funny guy that is willing to spent time describing the in's and out's of Amsterdam. He made me and my partner feel very comfortable and was there to help if necessary. The area where the room is situated suited us great. Room was as described and the location in my mind is as good as it can get in Amsterdam. Short walk to general amenities and a little further walk to get to all the good stuff downtown. <br/>Oh and the new shower in the apartment is great after a long touring!!<br/><br/>Thanks Wilbert for your time and it was great staying in your place and in Amsterdam."
23400933,"It was better than the brief review on AirBnb. The host is just amazing: very charming and full of suggestions so you will find everything you are looking for in the city.<br/>I will visit again. Thank you for a great time."
23448363,"Peike was a great host - she came and met us and let us in to her lovely apartment and gave us lots of information. Location in the old Jordaan area was great, pretty and quiet street on the canal and centrally located. A big master bedroom but a VERY small second bedroom, lovely big bathroom and all clean and modern facilities. Would definitely recommend staying here and would stay again. "
23451667,"You cannot spell Amsterdam without Marion.  Great support for everything you plan and never short on advice. A wonderful house, a beautiful garden,  a warm welcome and a super cozy bed await you.  The next trip to Amsterdam will definitely lead me again to Marion's place.  Don't wait,  visit her!"
23468361,"Rosie and Matt were very welcoming, and made us feel at home.  The room was exactly what we were expecting, and we had everything we needed.  It is in a quiet neighborhood, with easy access to most of Amsterdam.  A block from the tram stop, a 15 minute walk to the South Railway Station, 30 minutes to the airport.  A few minutes on the tram, or 1/2 hour of walking will get you almost anywhere you want to be in the city. The two flights of stairs were a little daunting when we arrived, but we got used to them quickly, and appreciated the view from the upstairs room.  We enjoyed visiting with our hosts over breakfast--that was a treat!!  I would definitely recommend this listing.  Thanks Rosie and Matt"
23555953,Excellent WE chez Gabriella et John. Très accueillant et disponible. On se sent comme chez soi. Bel appartement très bien situé !

23600214,"Très belle chambre, bien équipée, cosy avec une belle vue sur le canal dans le quartier rouge. David a été très accueillant et nous a permis de laisser nos bagages un peu plus tard le dernier jour. Idéalement située, proche de la gare et des trams, restaurants à proximité."
23611341,"Another flawless stay using AirBnB. We were greeted by Cleo who graciously waited after our plane was slightly delayed and gave us a good run through of the apartment and the local area.<br/><br/>The apartment is spacious with great Egyptian inspired decor. 3 of us stayed, there is a main bed, comfortable sofa bed and a great self-inflating air bed for the third. Everything you need is there for food making and washing.<br/><br/>It's only a 5 minute walk to the metro station then 3 stops to central, or a pleasant 20-odd minute walk along the canals, the apartment is also a stones throw away from the lovely Oosterpark which we definitely recommend visiting.<br/><br/>Thanks very much!"
23612542,"Joke è una persona molto piacevole e pronta a fornire utili informazioni e a venire incontro alle esigenze degli ospiti. Nel nostro caso in particolare ci ha permesso un check-in anticipato e un check-out ritardato in relazione agli orari dei nostri voli, permettendoci di sfruttare la nostra permanenza ad Amsterdam nel migliore dei modi. La stanza è piacevole e silenziosa ed è separata dalla finestra esterna da un piccolo vano, utilizzato per la colazione, con vista sulla piazza sottostante. La condivisione di bagno e wc non ha creato alcun problema. La colazione abbondante e varia e variata in alcuni dettagli da un giorno all'altro, aspetto che è degno di nota. Gli alimenti buoni e gustosi. La posizione dell'appartamento è ottima per visitare la città perché sotto casa passa il tram per il centro ed è comoda per raggiungere l'aeroporto. Anche in bici è facilissimo raggiungere il centro tutto su ciclabile. Da qui in bici e con mezzi pubblici è agevole raggiungere la zona di Zaandam e i suoi mulini. Il rapporto qualità/prezzo è molto buono. Nel complesso un'esperienza molto positiva (era la prima volta che usavo airbnb). Fatevi indicare il ristorante indonesiano che ci ha consigliato perché è molto buono, vario, piacevole e non costoso per gli standard cittadini. Consiglio la stanza. E consiglio di usare la bici per visitare la città: è il mezzo migliore. Un saluto a Joke che ricordiamo con simpatia e che un'ottima conoscitrice della sua zona di un certo interesse urbanistico e sociale."

23650313,"Wij hebben een erg fijne overnachting gehad! Wij vonden de buurt lekker rustig, maar we waren ook zo in het centrum: ideaal. Onze slaapplek was netjes en comfortabel. Maike en Caspar waren erg vriendelijk, behulpzaam en gastvrij. 's Ochtends nog genoten van een lekker ontbijtje, met koffie en thee! "
23653196,David was a great host and provided great tips about th city! His home is in a great location and the breakfast provided each day was wonderful. Thanks David!
23669238,The room was great and exactly as advertised. What sets this room a part from others is that it has it's own bathroom. Maike & Casper are friendly and helpful people who respect the privacy. I have absolutely zero complaints. It was a good experience. I would definetely recommend this.
23672591,"Anna is a lovely lady and it was an absolute pleasure to stay in her home. She’s ever so friendly and her hospitality skills are second to none. Oh, and her cat (Biscuits) is adorable too!<br/><br/>We spent a wonderful few days in Anna’s beautiful (and super-clean) apartment, which is really well-located in a picturesque part of the city.<br/><br/>Whilst we were there, Anna made every effort to make sure we were well fed, watered and was always on hand to recommend great food places and activities for us to do during our stay.<br/><br/>If ever we return to Amsterdam, we’ll definitely be paying Anna (and Biscuits!) another visit. In the meantime though, we really recommend that you enjoy your Amsterdam holiday at this apartment."
23688083,"The apartment is in a great location with superb views of the river and in walking distance to lots of cafés, shopping precincts and great public transport. <br/>The host made us very welcome with the apartment being well stocked and presented as on the website and lots of tourist information was provided."

23788130,"Stayed 5 nights in Eduardos apartment while visiting Amsterdam with a friend for Mysteryland.<br/>We were a bit surprised that it has 1 (double) bed, not 2 beds. We thought maybe the sofa in the livingroom was a sleeping sofa as we read there were 2 beds. This was not really a problem, but more of an misinterpretation on our side from the ad.<br/>Communication with Edoardo was very quick and he was the perfect host, in advance he notified us about how to get to the apartment and was there to meet us when we arrived.<br/>The apartment is spacious, has big windows and was very clean and tidy. The kitchen is modern and fully equipped with everything you need and the bedroom is spacious and will give you a good night's rest. The livingroom also is very tidy and modern and has a dining table as well as a sofa, chair and sofa table. <br/>The apartment is centrally located near Oosterpark, the Muiderpoort train stop is a quick 5-10 min walk away and the tram stop is just outside of the apartment. The apartment is in a side street with very little traffic and at night it is very quiet and nice. Supermarkets, cafes and various stores are within easy reach.<br/>I would love to stay there again and can safely recommended others to stay there for a nice and central, yet quiet location in Amsterdam."
23812815,"We loved staying in this apartment, it is really spacious and in a great location with fab views of the canal. We loved the comfy beds and the lift was particularly great, especially after running the marathon/half-marathon! We would definitely stay here again next time we visit Amsterdam, thanks Roman!"
23817659,"The apartment was nice, clean and as pictured. The area was quite nice with good restaurants, super markets and bars within a 10 minute walk. <br/><br/>The apartment is on the top floor with no elevator - the stairs are challenging to navigate both wit luggage or without.<br/><br/>Overall great apartment and host!"
23858007,"We werden zeer vriendelijk welkom geheten. Het was een warm onthaal.<br/>We kregen ook nuttige tips ivm ontbijt en bezienswaardigheden.<br/>Toen we een medisch probleempje hadden, werden we schitterend geholpen wat betreft medische zorgen en internetgebruik.<br/>In drie woorden: voor herhaling vatbaar! Hartelijk dank"

In spite of me having trouble with my flights from Amsterdam resulting in me arriving a little earlier, Wendy was still able to accommodate me. The flat was conveniently located near RAI station and 10-15 mins walk from Rijksmuseum.<br/><br/>I hope very much that I can stay again in the future."
24002629,"L'appartamento di Thijs è .... perfetto. Lui è molto gentile ed accomodante. Non ci siamo conosciuti di persona, ma non ci ha fatto mancare nulla pur non essendo presente. Siamo stati accolti da un suo amico che ci ha lasciato le chiavi e fornito un paio di suggerimenti su cosa potessimo o non potessimo fare considerando l'ora tarda. <br/>Eravamo due coppie, le camere sono ben distinte e separate, inoltre c'è un salotto con cucina e terrazza. Un'altra terrazza si trova al piano di sopra nella camera padronale. Al primo piano si trovano i servizi, di sopra accanto alla camera padronale la doccia con lavatrice ed asciugatrice. <br/>Il quartiere è assolutamente tranquillo, non troppo centrale. In bicicletta occorrono circa 15 minuti per raggiungere piazza Dam.  <br/>Nel complesso assolutamente soddisfatti di quanto ricevuto in proporzione al prezzo. Considerate che Amsterdam da questo punto di vista non è una città economica. <br/>Un ringraziamento finale per Thijs quindi, per la sua gentilezza ed ospitalità e per il suo bell'appartamento. "
24039402,"We had a great stay! The host Rosie was very welcoming and gave us many information about the city, the people and good touristic advises! The position of the house is the best!

We were met by a lovely lady with the key, and she showed us how things worked including wifi, and provided a map and directions. There was tea and coffee, and Dutch biscuits - plenty for tired travellers to settle in!"
24101174,David's bnb was perfect. Just the right amount of space for two people. The water pressure in the shower was better then my home! The room was cozy and had a charming view. Davids hospitality was unparalleled. The breakfast included was a nice touch to an already great stay. David was also extremely attentive and responded quickly to any messages I sent him. He was a great host. I would recommend this listing to everyone and hope to return next time I am in Amsterdam! Thanks David xxx
24112557,"Gabriel and Marloes amazing hosts.  Very warm, friendly and helpful.  Communication was very prompt and smooth.  They provided everything we needed.  They are a true reflection of what air bnb is all about.  We will definitely look them up if we are in Amsterdam again!<br/><br/>The space is great!  The unit is clean, comfortable and cozy.  Location is terrific.  A little outside the city centre.  But, the tram is only 10 min walk away.  They also provide bikes so you can get around the city very easily.  Biking down to the city centre or museum in about 20 min."
24117177,"Stef and Angela were both very welcoming and sweet! They gave us great advice on places we can travel to and see in Amsterdam. The room is very spacious and comfortable.

24120521," We had such a good time enjoying Amsterdam, and Edith's place contributed with that, it's a great place to stay!<br/>It is very well localized, very comfortable and cozy, super clean and have everything you could need! We felt like we were staying in a very good hotel suit!<br/>Unfortunately not everything can be perfect, so the only two down sides are the stairs that are quite a lot and the beds that are two separate beds side by side, but it didn't make us appreciate nothing less than we could!<br/>We would definitely recommend her place and will look forward to stay there again when we are back to town!<br/>Thank you very much for everything Edith!"
24125126,The bed is really cozy n S is so<br/>Nice preparing everything for us :)
24154175,"My stay in Amsterdam at this B&B was absolutely wonderful.  The room was clean, comfortable and beautiful, and staying with Rosie and her family was lovely.  She put out breakfast for us every morning, even going out of her way to meet my health restrictions with certain foods, and she went above and beyond in helping me get access to all the major museums (she even told us the best time of day to go in order to avoid long lines!).  The apartment is in a quiet, residential neighborhood that is only a very short walk from the city center, and its location makes it a great fit for anyone like me who was spending most of the time in museums.  Communication with Rosie was great throughout and she gave us advice as to how to get to and from the airport.  Overall, the stay was great!"
24159430,"Had an awesome night is this room. It was modern, clean, and in a beautiful quiet area which was easy to find and easy to get around. The room has everything we could want. Maike and Casper were super helpful and friendly. It was a great stay and I would stay again in a heartbeat."
24160409,"My boyfriend and I stayed for 3 nights and couldn't have asked for more. Lovely people who provided a great room, with coffee and tea making facilities, an ensuite shower, great view and their own kind of guidebook. In this there was recommendations of things to do and places to eat etc.  Really helpful! A great breakfast was served to us each morning. No complaints whatsoever!! Great location, 15  or so mins from centre by direct bus. Easy to use. Both hosts were lovely and reply very quickly to any queries. Definitely recommend!!"
24220608,"The house was extremely lovely, and the deco was amazing. Olaf was helpful and really gave us a lot of information and tips on exploring Amsterdam. The house was really close to the Albert Cuyp market by walking distance, and the city centre was easily accessible as well by tram. :) Definitely recommend!! "
24278830,we were made very welcome and were happy to find the room seemed even bigger than the picture suggested. beautiful little ensuite that wasn't cramped. Missed David by a day but Jamaal carried our bags upstairs for us and walked with us to the supermarket and took very good care of us. Two coffee shops just outside the door with seating on the canal and two respectable bars nearby. Would recommend this B&B to anyone and would love to go back sometime. Everything is very clean. Loved the wine glasses and the table and chairs in the room.
24297214,"Nice house in a quiet neighborhood. Marga was very helpful, and even offered to pick me up from the metro. "

24356103,"Increible departamento!! Super equipado, espacioso, limpio y equipado, la ubicacion no es la mejor pero amsterdam es chico y se llega caminando a todos lados. Recomiendo que organices tu llegada con tiempo dado que femke tarda en contestar los mensajes y a ultimo momento nos informo que debiamos esperar a que saliera del trabajo para recibirnos... A nosotros nos significo aproximadamente dos horas en un bar, cansados y con nuestras maletas"
24358335,"Tolle Lage, super Zimmer, einfach 100 %  der Erwartungen erfüllt.<br/>"

24455991,"We had a great time staying in Simone's place. I love the living room and we even spent a whole afternoon just sitting by the window and enjoying my relaxing time. The roof was fantastic as well. We loved to feel the wind on the roof after dinner. It was romantic, hahah.<br/><br/>Most important thing I have to say is that Simone was a super great host!"
24470789,"Awesome stay at Manon's house, it is so welcoming and comfortable, we had an amazing time in Amsterdam!<br/>Manon and Claudio are very helpful and did everything to make us feel like home.<br/>The bus leaves very close to the house and you get to take the free ferry to reach centraal station, the only downside is that you'll have to pay for taxi (about 45€) after 8pm if you don't have a car because bus service stops early.<br/>If you need a place in Amsterdam I definitely recommend this house!<br/>Hasta luego<br/>Claire & friends"
24475546,"We really enjoyed Franks flat, it's a mix of cool and individual deco, big open space and cosy terrace to sit on for breakfast.<br/>We loved the location: lots of local restaurants, the Jordaan area is very charming, you're away from the touristy bits but very central. All in all a great stay, would love to come back there for a longer period! <br/>Only downside: as Frank was away, the checkin took much longer than expected with the agency. "
24492897,"Marion estuvo muy atenta en todo momento. Llegamos del aeropuerto sobre las 00:30 de la noche y nos estaba esperando para recibirnos y enseñarnos la habitación, lavabo, etc. Cada día nos preguntó a qué hora queríamos desayunar al día siguiente y nos ayudó en todo lo referente a como desplazarnos y movernos por Amsterdam.<br/>Si volvemos a Amsterdam sin duda que intentaremos alojarnos de nuevo con ella."
24521465,"Notre hôte nous a toujours répondu très vite à tous nos messages. Elle a essayé de mieux nous connaitre avant notre arrivée pour bien préparer la maison et les chambres. Un petit cadeau de bienvenue était très agréable après un long voyage. Des indications nous ont été laissé en arrivant avec des conseils très utiles tout au long du séjour. La maison est parfaite, agréable, bien agencée, dans un quartier calme et d'accès très aisé et rapide dans le centre d'Amsterdam (bus, vélo, ferry gratuit) ou vers les nombreux chemins à faire en vélo.  Nous recommandons vivement cette location. Les enfants ont adoré."
24525885,"The flat is really beautiful.. cosy, comfortable, quiet. The room is clean and warm. It takes approximately 20-25 minutes of walk till city center. Mieke is super wonderful person.

It was clean and had a Philips Senso coffee machine and a kettle,however no hair dryer.<br/>Location was excellent. We walked to all the attractions and there were many food outlets nearby.<br/>The only thing I did not like was the mattress and pillows which I found to be too soft which gave me a back ache.<br/> Reinout is a very friendly,hospitable host.<br/>He  helped to bring my luggage up to the room.There was a Nespresso coffee machine which I enjoyed a lot, besides several teas provided.<br/>In the mini fridge was a bottle of wine, two beers, chocolates and a large bottle of water.<br/>The breakfast he prepared was exquisitely presented. We truly enjoyed it.<br/>This is a  room with character, beautifully decorated. Skylights  ensured good natural lighting. The bed was very comfortable.<br/>Location wise, a ten  minute walk from Central Station and Damrak is just round the corner. Plenty of food choices nearby.<br/><br/>"

They were such gracious and welcoming hosts, with Sebastian providing us with a thorough orientation of the city, along with some local tips to help us experience Amsterdam beyond the tourist attractions. They were completely responsive and made themselves available should we have needed any assistance or extra information. (Getting there was easy as they provided us with a very exact set of directions very much in advance of our arrival.)<br/>The apartment itself was delightful, cozy, and located in an idyllic part of town. It was an easy twenty minutes tram ride (the stop is unbelievably convenient to the apt's location) from almost all the major sites, with a beautiful park, food plaza, and the Space Center station to the airport all only 2-7 minutes walk away!<br/>Overall, Sebastian and Stephanie's place was exactly what we needed and it even exceeded our expectations. Beautiful, safe, and convenient. We wouldn't hesitate to stay with them again should we find ourselves back in Amsterdam."
24638665,"Eva's apartment was so cosy and beautiful,surrounded with silent canal area.<br/>It was very impressive to me that dutch people is very kind,above all eva was the best.

The car can be parked free of charge and securely in an underground parking!! Everything perfectly for a city trip, thanks Elmar and a happy new year"
24656371,Toetsie has been the best hosts I've encountered on Airbnb. She provided me with more than I was expecting for a pleasant stay in Amsterdam and she is genuinely willing to assist and make you feel comfortable at home. The apartment is in a nice area also with relatively close proximity to major tourist attractions by public transportation or bike. I would definitely recommend a stay here!
24658534,"We had a great time at Jobs place. The apartment is really well equipped with everything anyone could need to have a comfortable stay. The location couldn't be better, it's on a quiet street but a short walk from great cafes and restaurants. It rained most of the time we were there but we didn't mind as we were more than happy to just relax in the apartment!  Job was a great host, very friendly and helpful. We can't wait to come back!! Cheers Job!"

Alles was in het appartement aanwezig, zelfs allerlei ontbijtspullen (jam , boter, pindakaas, brood, zelfs eitjes!) In de badkamer staan diverse shampoos, tandpasta etc etc. Als je hier met lege handen aankomt dan kom je niks tekort! Micha zelf is een heel innemende man, hij houdt zich 100% aan gemaakte afspraken.. Het appartement heeft een heerlijk ruime woonkamer met meerdere banken, een grote TV, WIFI en zelfs een computer voor de gasten. Gewoon top! Ik kan nog even doorgaan maar het is gewoon GOED! Enige jammere is dat er alleen stapelbedden staan.  Is met allemaal volwassenen toch even wennen. Bedden liggen overigens wel prima en zijn superschoon. Oh en ook fijn: het is echt maar 10-15 minuten lopen naar het Ziggo Dome en parkeren in de straat voor 10 euro per dag. Micha, super bedankt voor alles en oh...stom...ik ben de fles Amsterdamse ouzo vergeten mee te nemen.. dat is dom! Ik kom ´m misschien ooit nog eens ophalen! Want een ding is zeker: als ik (we) ooit weer naar een concert ga(an) in Ziggo dome dan slapen we in jouw appartement! Dank dank dank"
24734392,"De locatie was prachtig, mooi uitzicht over het IJ. We werden uitermate vriendelijk verwelkomd, ook door de 2 lieve border collies.<br/>Er is op loopafstand een supermarkt en restaurantjes waar je wat kunt eten.<br/>De kamer is ruim genoeg voor met z'n tweeën. Er is genoeg opbergruimte en een koelkastje en tv. <br/>En het ontbijtje was heerlijk."
24736811,"The communication was really fast and precise.<br/>The room it exactly as in the pictures.<br/>The bed is comfortable and the temperature inside the apartment is perfect.<br/>Just the bathroom is a bit small."
24753530,"Petra is very nice person and her house its beautiful, we travel with two kids and they liked their room sou much. Everything was cleen and fresh. Thanks, stefan and family"

24777759,"We had a very nice stay at Lidia & Jean-Paul appartment in Amsterdam ! <br/><br/>They are very friendly and welcoming hosts. The appartment is located in a very nice neighborhood next to Vondelpark and you can easily bike your way around the city.<br/><br/>Just good to know that the stairs are very steep to reach the appartment...<br/><br/>"
24875278,"Apartment was fantastic, exactly as pictured. the apartment is centrally located but still very quiet. Very spacious, clean and warm. David was very helpful and friedly.<br/>It was really great."
24902042,"Host was helpful. Listing was accurate, but if advertising for 8 people then amenities for 8 people should be provided a standard. <br/><br/>Overall, good stay. "
24909215,"We had an absolutely lovely time at Toetsie's place. Toetsie is such a warm, lovely person who made our stay in Amsterdam really great. She gave us some good recommendations of where to go and shared some wine with us on her rooftop (which is really fantastic). The room itself was perfect for us and Toetsie left us a few breakfast items, towels and toiletries which was very generous. The lounge area (shared with one other guest in a separate room) is also wonderful. Generally you feel as if you have a lot of space which is great. The location is also really good - so quick on bike to anywhere you want to be in central (main museums about 10 mins on cycle - maybe less) and walking is also fine. Toetsie was really flexible about our arrival and check out time as well. We really loved our stay here and would 100% recommend it! "
24927871,"The hosts were great and super hospitable. The room was just as expected, warm cozy and very comfortable bed. Shared bathroom but it was still convenient. Absolutely loved the location as it's near everything in the center of the city. And we were very impressed with the breakfast at the local bakery! Marvelous experience. Ideal for couples. Thank you Matthijs and Francina!"
24944492,"Nous avons été accueilli chaleureusement par quelqu'un de la famille de Harry et Anna, qui a bien répondu à toutes nos questions.<br/>Bateau-logement plein de charme, reposant, propre et design, comme sur les photos. La terrasse est sur le toit.<br/>Habitation vraiment pratique et fonctionnelle.<br/>Logement original dans un quartier calme, verdoyant à 30 min à vélo du centre.<br/>Parking payant (sauf le dimanche) mais pratique. Tramway à 5 min à pied.<br/>La possibilité de visiter Amsterdam à vélo est un plus. (même en hiver !)"
24945640,Rosie is a very friendly host. We've had nice conversations right from the start. Staying at Rosie's apartment feels like you are at home. Also because you have breakfast in the living room where you meet the other members of the family. The neighborhood is lovely with a lot of buildings from the 1920s and 1930s. All the shops and restaurant you need are nearby. It takes fifteen minutes to walk to the Museum Area and the railway station Zuid/WTC is ten minutes by foot. 
24963854,"Thanks for a wonderful stay!  I went to the boat for a surprise birthday for my boyfriend and 16 friends and it was a perfect choice.  The boat is clean and the main living area is big and comfortable. <br/><br/>Great facilities for cooking and plenty of kitchen ware.  Would highly recommend. <br/>"

25010491,"This apartment is in a great location and area of Amsterdam. There are two set of steep stairs to get to the unit and the street is a bit loud but the location is right by everything. Deb was very friendly & provided a lot of helpful tourist items,maps, books etc. The apartment is very clean & cute. Very close to tram & canals. Daily market within walking distance. I would stay there again! Only odd & a little troubling thing that took place was upon our arrival....we were a bit early & it was raining. We rang, saw Deb through the door & emailed to let her know we were outside. Yes we were early but it made it awkward because she had to have seen us out in the rain. We stood there for at over 20 mins in the rain."

25084761,"Marga was a welcoming host. She was quick to reply to our request and made every effort to get us oriented to the garden room. She even included us in her family's New Year's celebration. Breakfast was amazing - try the toast with chocolate spinkles! yum! Room was pre-warmed with a wood stove upon arrival. They had a bike for me to use in Amsterdam, which worked out great - it really is the best way to see Amsterdam! Marga went over several places to visit and helped me plan an excellent adventure. "
25094494,"My sister and I stayed 2 nights in Amsterdam, and even if we never meet him, Simon has been an incredible host, very helpful and kind at any time. His flat is exactly like in the pictures, perfectly clean and tidy. Towels and precious advices were provided, as well as city guides. Everything has been made to make our stay perfect and for that, I highly recommend Simon's place!"
25099856,"The rooms were in a great location just a few minutes walk to the museums. A small cafe around the corner was great for breakfast. We would walk the the museums and take canal boats from there to get into downtown. The rooms were extremely clean, comfortable and with a nice sized shower. The neighborhood was very nice and safe. All said, it was better than we expected  and recommend it to anyone looking for a couple of nice rooms to sleep in."
25115627,"Olaf is a super nice host! Communication was very smooth and he's very responsive with a lot of recommendation and detailed instruction to his place. <br/>The neighbourhood is awesome, very close to Albert Cuyp market and the airport. <br/>The place is very cozy and you will definitely feel being welcomed by Mickey Mouse, it is very clean and spacious in the room, rooftop and kitchen. <br/>My parents and I had so far the best Airbnb experience with Olaf."

25154015,"We had a wonderful stay in the apartment and Amsterdam. Peter is an excellent host. Though we arrived late at the airport and checked in late at the apartment, Peter was there to wait until we arrived. The apartment is on a first floor and is clean and is very well located. It is what as described. The bus and tram stop is very near to frequent to the city centre. We would love to stay in Peter's if we have the opportunity to visit Amsterdam again.<br/>kamil/zaleha"

25230712,"Bas has been like having a brother in Amsterdam, he didn´t meet us at home, he met us at the tram stop and welcomed us with wine, snaks and other delicious supplies. Bas indicated us how to get to the apatment step by step from Eindhoven airport, perfect combination. He also provided us a list of restaurants and markets near the apartment,  wich were wonderful and ""non tourist"". The apartment was very clean and super comfortable, 15 minutes from the centre. We didn´t use the tram, although there were two different stops in front of the apartment, because we had a wonderful and unique experience, with Bas ´s bikes, we visited all Amsterdam by bike!!! Bas is a fabulous host, we had a last minute problem, and there he was, again like a brother.<br/>All in all a fantastic stay.<br/>Thank you Bas."
25243698,"Matthijs is a very sweet and accommodating host. He offered to carry my bags and even did our laundry! <br/><br/>There is a steep staircase leading up to the room.

25254514,"Very nice men, he help me in everything like get me a bike and talking about nice place to visit in ams"
25258588,Gabriella and her husband were very friendly and helpful.  I was only in Amsterdam for 24 hours and they provided me with a map and directions to some of the popular attractions the city has to offer.  The accommodations were very comfortable and they generously offered food and beverages throughout my stay.  The location of the apartment is very easy to get to the city center using the tram or even a quick walk if the weather is nice.  I would definitely stay here again the next time I find myself in Amsterdam.
25270181,"Wendy welcomed us with a good glass of bear, a warm smile and a lot of good advices for our stay in Amsterdam.<br/>Upon our arrival we found flowers on the table, guidebooks, small presents and all kitchen supplies at our disposal. <br/>The apartment is cozy and lively, it is located in a very quiet street and the small garden in the back is lovely. At the end of the day we enjoyed to get back home and cook our own meal using the good Mediterranean spices that Wendy has in her well equipped kitchen.<br/>The warm welcome, the tips received and Wendy assistance have been fundamentals in making special our short stay in Amsterdam. <br/>We loved staying here and we recommend it!<br/>Irene and Guido<br/>"
25276550,"After some initial confusion with another group booked into the downstairs flat when we arrived, we proceeded to have a great stay here for the IBC conference. Accomodated 5 people easily, and probably could have squeezed in a few more thanks to the large sofas, although the beds in the bedroom were a bit soft. Shower was great, kitchen facilities were great. Recommended."
25294896,"No tuvimos el placer de conocer a Sarah pero conocimos a su padre, una persona increible. Y por el aspecto en gral del departamento nos imaginamos lo mejor de Sarah.

25310716,I loved staying at Edwin's place! The room is nice and cozy and is in a great location. You can just look out of the window and see the nightlife happening below! I also really appreciated the artwork in the room and how clean and thought out everything was. Edwin even typed up a nice note apologizing that he couldn't meet me because he was visiting his mother. Highly recommend :)

25372521,"Toetsie is very personable and accommodating-and makes the most wonderful natural soap.  The location is convenient to tram and tube, and is in a quiet  neighborhood.  Stairs can be a little trying with large or heavy luggage.  Room is comfortable. Make sure you visit the roof for sunset! "
25387849,"The apartment is comfortable and the hosts are very nice and couteous. The free parking possibility is really a thick plus and also the fact, that we could leave our bikes in the garden - it was perfect for us !!! We would stay at this place again without hesitating. :-)"

Highly Recommended "
25414809,"David was a fantastic host. The room was phenomenal, with a luxurious en-suite bathroom. The place was in the center of Amsterdam, maybe 4 or 5 minutes' walk from the train station.

25522173,"Hendrik and Edelmira could not have been easier hosts to work with: always immediately responsive, easy going, and ready to fix any issue. Unfortunately the apartment itself could use a thorough cleaning and an update on household items such as towels, pillows, and pans. The apartment is spacious but not 'luxury.' The neighborhood is full of restaurants and cafes and makes for easy access to all other parts of the city. Additionally, it is very easy to reach the apartment from the airport via train and tram. "
25539710,"Martijns, apartments is the place to which all five stars could be given! Perfect location, sunny, modern stylish design and with a welcoming host. Be sure You'll be satisfied with it. My staying in Amsterdam was great! Thank You Martijn!"

25605684,"Die Unterkunft war genau wie beschrieben. Das ganze Haus war super gemütlich und wohnlich eingerichtet. Bei unserer Ankunft erwartete uns auf dem Bett eine Flasche Wein, Apfelsaft und andere Kleinigkeiten. Toetsie war sehr herzlich, immer offen für Fragen und hat uns Tipps gegeben. Wir hätten uns unseren Aufenthalt nicht besser vorstellen können. Mit dem Fahrrad war von der Wohnung aus alles gut zu erreichen und in der Wohnung haben uns immer mal wieder die beiden Katzen besucht mit denen wir uns angefreundet haben. Alles in allem ein super Kurzurlaub mit guten Einblicken ins richtige Amsterdamer Leben !"

25653080,"Esthers Wohnung ist einfach traumhaft! Sehr liebevoll eingerichtet. Sie liegt in einer Nebenstraße in einer netten Nachbarschaft mit vielen Restaurants und Bars. Die Schlüsselübergabe mit der sehr freundlichen Nachbarin hat problemlos geklappt. Es lagen Straßenpläne und nützliche Informationen zu Sehenswürdigkeiten bereit. Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt! Eine Grundausstattung an Tee und Kaffee waren ebenfalls vorhanden, worüber wir uns sehr gefreut haben. Vielen Dank für die Flasche Wein :) <br/>Die Innenstadt ist mit der Straßenbahn, die in ca. 200 Meter Entfernung abfährt, in rund 15 Minuten erreichbar."
25656210,"We had 3 night in Amsterdam.<br/><br/>S. is very friendly. We saw her 3 times in the that weekend, so she want get in your way.<br/><br/>The apartment is around 5 km from city center, but close to Jordan District where there is many cafés.<br/><br/>But the pictures are not similar to the reality. The apartment is quite dirty, the entrance to the building smells of moist and the apartment very much of cat. ( we knew there was a cat, but not a heavy smell of it). The cat by the way is very friendly.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>1:Very good bed<br/><br/>2:God size room<br/><br/>3:The host has two travel cards for public transportation, which makes it easier and cheaper to get around :)<br/><br/>But thats about it.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>1:Dirty, Dirty, Dirty.<br/><br/>2:The kitchen does not invite you to make any kind of food. There was filled ashtray, used pans, empty pizza boxes and eggshells. S, cleaned the kitchen the day after but still... <br/><br/>3:Our room got painted one day, so we had to sleep in the steams of paint. We where warned, but the host could have waited until our check out, the very next day.<br/><br/>4: The heavy smell of cat ( it was way more than we expected)<br/><br/>Next time Im in Amsterdam, I will stay in another place."
25680924,"My wife and I had a lovely time in Amsterdam. The room was very comfortable and cozy. Rosie and Matthew are very nice.<br/>We had a little issue with a noisy guest on the 1st night, but the next morning I told Rosie and see obviously had a word because for the rest of our stay we didn't hear anything from anyone! <br/>The shared bathroom isn't too bad. The shower is good. The toilet is very noisy though. When flushed it sounds like a plane taking off. So anyone using it during the night must wake everyone up.<br/>Good transport links from the Airport and to City centre. Nice places to eat right by apartment. Good place to stay if you're on a budget."
25683009,"She was a very friendly and welcoming host, and the appartment was nice and clean. A very good thing was that we were allowed to be in the whole appartment. The location of the appartment was perfect, you could either walk to the city or take the tram. She was helpful and showed us places we could visit. The only thing that was negative with this place was that she smoked inside, and we are not smokers. All in all, the smoke was the only con, otherwise she was a perfect host."

25716663,"Easily the best place we stayed during our Europe trip. My girlfriend and I stayed two nights but we both couple have stayed two weeks. Laura and her husband greeted us warmly into their beautiful home and helped with our bags. We signed some paperwork and they took our coffee order for the next morning! The suite was exactly what we needed. The bed was very comfortable and the kitchen had everything we needed for our short stay. The rainfall shower was awesome. In the morning Laura brought down our coffees and a beautiful basket of bread, fresh croissants, fruit and eggs for us. It was the perfect way to start our morning each day. The house was very clean and welcoming. The location was great and within walking or biking to anything you need. Staying here made our visit in Amsterdam great. I would definitely stay here again  and would recommend it to anyone. "

Such a beautiful apartment with amazing touches such as pieces of art all around the apartment, little candles, wonderful furniture, AMAZING beds which were so comfortable! Really wonderful bathrooms and a very well appointed kitchen and two lovely balconies! The best aspect of our stay however was meeting Esther and Marco, two wonderful people. They made us feel so welcome from start to finish and went above and beyond what we expected in order to make us feel comfortable. Getting to chat to them was the one of the highlights of our trip, they are warm, friendly, wonderful people and I cannot recommend staying at their place enough. Thank you so much guys, we already miss being there and we can't wait to plan our next trip there! Thank you so much for everything! "
25853940,"The room was as comfortable as described. The area, while in the RDL, was quiet and convenient to travel from. We felt we had the best of both worlds, with access to the RDL where the restaurants are good and open late with lots of nightlife, and the accessibility to see the rest of city. I would recommend this accommodation for someone who likes to go out but also likes some peace and quiet. "
25856478,"Marga was very welcoming. It took me a few extra minutes to find it, but once there it was nice and relaxing. Marga and her family are friendly people with an open mind. The personal wood-based heater was awesome :-) Friendly and relaxed guy, nice neighbourhood and easily accessible by public transport. Simply a great place to stay."
25867041,Wonderful house in a great location.  It's a short 2 mi ute walk to the square with restaurants and bars close by.  But far enough that you don't hear any noise at night.  The house is beautiful.  I would recommend it to anyone going to Amsterdam in a group.
25876548,Maike en Caspar hebben een prachtige B&B op een schitterende plek. Wat een mooi uitzicht! En toch dicht bij het centrum. Je kunt vanaf hier heel mooi fietsen en bent dan ook zo de stad weer uit. Wij willen hier zeker nog een keer logeren! Daarnaast zijn Caspar en Maike hele leuke gezellige mensen. Een aanrader dus!
25877662,"This is one of the best places I have ever stayed in Amsterdam. The location is bar none, the most centrally located without staying in a hotel. <br/>The house is stunning and each en-suite has its own charm and tasteful decor. Room D has access to a back patio which is amazing. It was such a pleasure to stay here and I will be booking again. <br/>"
25926405,"Great apartment, everything perfectly clean and a stunning view from the rooftop terrace. Olaf was a great host. He provided us with information about Amsterdam and always had a joke on his lips. I would recommend Olaf's apartment to everybody who is traveling to AMS. You just shouldn't be scared of Mickey Mouse....but who is?"
25928117,"Marijke è stata molto cordiale e carina, ed era tutto pulito ma... la descrizione della stanza era non fumatori, solo dopo aver prenotato, ho letto di 1 recensione che si lamentava dell'odore di fumo. Le ho scritto con la richiesta di chiarimenti in merito, perché nessuno di noi due è fumatore. Mi ha assicurato che è stata un'ospite americana un po' particolare, assicurandomi che non avremo avuto questo problema. Bene, purtroppo non è stato così, non ho dormito nulla causa l'odore del fumo ""vecchio"", forse nei cuscini oppure sulle pareti, anche perché il letto sul soppalco è così vicino al soffitto, quando una persona è stesa è meno di un metro, esageratamente basso, l'odore del fumo si sentiva molto forte, anche sugli asciugamani. Al ns. arrivo mi ha chiesto subito se lo sentivo, in effetti all'ingresso non era così forte, forse avevamo ancora il naso congelato dal freddo e comunque, siamo stati nella stanza 5 minuti di orologio per scappare alle ns. escursioni. Purtroppo, ripeto, tutto pulito, lei carina, ma ...ho perso una notte di sonno e il letto non era certo per una coppia che desiderava un po' di intimità, molto scomodo con il soffitto incollato sulla testa. Per completare, lo scopino del bagno si è smontato e non è stato carino doverlo...riprendere in mano e riattaccarlo al manico, può succedere, ma per il prezzo pagato, forse, avrebbe dovuto verificare prima. Grazie Silvia"
25933463,"Thanks David for  the bed and breakfast.<br/>We were confident in David when we booked our Holidays and it was the reality when we arrived in the apartement.<br/>The room is pleasant and not so far from the central station and near the most importants districs that you have to see in Amsterdam. <br/>If we have to go to Amsterdam,  we will book this room.<br/>Thierry"
25934383,"We had a fantastic holiday in beautiful Amsterdam and our holiday was made even better by retuning to the warm and cozy house boat each night! Jake and Alya are delightful and made us feel so welcome. When we arrived there was some wine and beer, the boat was very clean and cozy and we got a fantastic sleep each night, the shower was also great, oh and so was the coffee machine. Jake and Alya go that extra mile to make the experience  wonderful. We would highly recommend anyone to stay here in the future and we hope to be back again too. <br/>Thanks Jake  and Alya, you are great !   "
25936295,"The apartment was really great ! All clean, equipped with what we needed. The tram is just at 2 minutes by foot and gets you in town in 15 minutes and it was a frequent one so very easy to get in the center ! Bram was really nice and helpful, we had a super 10 day stay in his apartment,  I really would go back there if I have to go to Amsterdam in the future"
25938113,"Staying at Petra's AirBnB was just perfect. The room is beautiful, bright, clean, and sooo cozy! Location is also great, the beautiful park Vondelpark is right behind the house. Our morning strolls through Vondelpark towards the city center are those to remember.  And last but not least, Petra is a super host, very welcoming and lovely person. I can only recommend! "
25952771,"I loved staying at Hein's studio! It's the perfect home base for exploring Amsterdam. It is comfortable and has all the basic necessities. The neighborhood is safe and quiet. Restaurants, pubs, a nice bread shop and a grocery are within blocks. Tram and subway stops right around the corner make it very easy to explore town, but many locations are within a 20 minute walk. Easily the best part was having Hein as a host! He is welcoming and his recommendations for what to see on and off the map helped us have an amazing experience during our short stay in Amsterdam. Highly recommend and would definitely stay again!"
25957455,"It was a perfect stay!!the apartment was exactly as it is shown in the pictures. We had a warm welcoming thanks to the host family and the neighbour, who showed us the surroundings. Everything was perfect and we really thank the family for this pleasant stay. "
26006960,"The flat is nicer than pictures.  It has gorgeous high ceilings.  The beds are comfortable (two king, one single) Huge bathrooms.  We had the basics that we needed to cook, enough towels and an easy location.  Bring an extension cord with plugs if you need to charge devices as there aren't many places to plug.  I don't recommend this flat for elderly people because is the typical really steep Amsterdam stairs to get in the flat.<br/> If you are looking where to stay, this is it!! I have been to Amsterdam 4 times and stayed in 6 airbnbs.  Many of them with huge steep stairs and not nearly as nice and as great price as this one  It is SO equipped with everything you will need and more.  Is 3 blocks from all the buzz.  I will book this again for sure.  So pretty, clean, modern and PERFECT! 5 STARS.  Rini was fantastic host.  great communication and very friendly.  "
26011212,"We stayed at Karin's Boathouse for 3 days with my mom and were very pleased ! The room is absolutely well located and decorate, the bed is comfortable and the heating works well ! <br/>Karin took care that we had everything we needed and was lovely !<br/>RECOMMENDED ! <br/>"
26027823,"THIS ROOM IS INCREDIBLE! The pictures don't do it justice. Chatham and I felt completely at home, it is very close to ALL forms of public transport, and Wilma is great. If you're looking to a place for an excellent price point, location, character, safety....the whole works....stay here! I felt like I was in a suite and the natural light/view over the canal was breathtaking. Chatham and I would love to stay here again!"
26051675,"Rosie's place is perfectly located in a calm neighbourhood yet close to everything. The room was spacious, clean and lovely. Unfortunately we didn't get the chance to meet Rosie but her daughter made us feel like home.  The advertisement didn't mention the shared bathroom but we didn't have a problem with that. "
26055507,"Such a great flat, highly recommended!"
26116350,Pim made us feel very welcome during our stay. The descriptions were accurate and everything was smooth. Would recommend!
26122883,"David was very helpful and attentive.  We stayed for four nights in March 2015.  The room was spacious, clean and attractively decorated.  The location of the room, just two blocks from the train station made getting around on the tram very easy.  We had a nice continental breakfast delivered promptly at 8am.  Our only criticism of the room was it faced on the street/canal and was noisey until the wee hours of the morning.  We are in our 80s and had concern about the stairs.  David carried our bags up and down.  We would stay here again.  Very pleasant stay We were a bit concerned the location was remote from the main part of the city but the ferry was a short walk away.  We also enjoyed the nearby restaurants.  Would chose the studio again."
26139413,"Afgelopen weekend een nachtje bij Gina geslapen. We werden vriendelijk met een kopje koffie ontvangen. Na de koffie even wat praktische tips, sleutels in ontvangst nemen en onze spullen naar de kamer brengen. Prima kamer, netjes, schoon en heerlijke ruime bedden. Kamer ook voorzien van WIFI en een klein prive zitje buiten. Naast de kamer ook een prima en schone douche en toilet.<br/><br/> 's Morgens een lekker ontbijtje met een vers gebakken uitsmijter, diverse soorten beleg, koffie, thee en vruchtensap.<br/><br/>Liggen in Amsterdam ook prima. Heerlijk rustige staat en slechts 5 minuten lopen naar Metrostation Wibautstraat. Ongeveer 20 minuten lopen naar Rembrandtplein<br/><br/>Wij komen hier zeker nog eens terug!<br/><br/><br/>PS. De B&B heeft ook nog een tweepersoonkamer!<br/>"
26162197,Laura is an amazing host. The airbnb is perfect!! The apartment is gorgeous and the location is beyond ideal. I would recommend her apartment to every one!
26168073,"Hôtes accueillants,  toujours disponibles pour répondre aux questions et donner des conseils sur les activités ! <br/>L'appartement équipé se situe dans une maison typique ', bien qu'en sous-sol, il  s'avère spacieux et confortable (mention spéciale pour la salle de bain et ses produits haut de gamme !). <br/>Bonne situation géographique: la plupart des points d'intérêt sont accessibles à pied. Je recommande cependant vivement la location de vélos, qui restent le meilleur moyen de transport à Amsterdam. <br/>Je conseille vivement l'option petit déjeuner : copieux et livré directement à l'heure voulue. Possibilité de parking en sus. "
26189925,"David was a very friendly and caring host. The flat was perfect like on the pictures. Everything was clean and the bathroom was modern. There was a hairdryer, a small safe and a fridge. The breakfast was very tasty, we got fresh croissants, eggs, cornflakes, etc. which David placed in front of our door every morning at a chosen time. The location of the flat was very central, we could reach everything by foot. Despite it was very quiet in the evening/night so we always got a good sleep in the comfortable bed. The train station is also not far at all. We were really happy with our choice to stay at Davids flat!! We definitely recommend it and hope to come back soon :) "
26190312,"S made our stay in Amsterdam really easy and enjoyable. Her place is only two or three minutes walk from the tram, supermarket and yummy places to eat! She had a great folder of thing's to do, coupons and a printout of everything we needed to know about her place. Her cat (naz) was friendly and placed himself on my back pack, ready for a belly rub, while we were settling in. Everything was as per her listing and S is laid back and happy to chat and help you."
26198055,Maika and Casper were the best!!! The place was so nice and clean. You have your own private shower and bathroom which is hard to come by in Amsterdam. The location was great and a quick bus ride into the city. I also walked my way into the city one day. The breakfast was phenomenal! She had more then enough for me and I even took some bread with me for later in the day. She made me espresso as soon as I got there! She was the sweetest! I would HIGHLY recommend their home. I am now staying at another place in Amsterdam and I must say I wish I could of stayed at their place longer! Thank you so much for the wonderful hospitality!! <br/> John was great! I got to meet him and he showed me a bunch of different places to go. The north was my favorite part of the whole city (I stayed in 3 different areas.) He left the next day and trusted us with his place to ourselves. He was a great host and would definitely recommend a stay here! Took a ferry to the NDSM and walked all through the north back to his place. It was my favorite part of my trip. Thanks for everything! 
26207710,It was a pleasure! Liked the place.
26232848,"My wife and me stayed at Marieke's place for a weekend and we had a great time. The weather was really really bad so it was wonderful to have such a nice place to stay. The apartment is just like you can see it on the photos and it has a beautiful vibe to it. The location is great because it's in a quiet neighborhood without being far away from the action. There are two bikes available which makes your stay even more relaxed.<br/>Marieke is a lovely host who really takes interest in giving their guests a wonderful time and who offers her help with everything. For example she has designed a little book with just the right information about where to go, where to find food or where to have lunch & dinner. She even thinks about bad weather and offers rain coats!<br/>If we are coming back to Amsterdam we will definitely trying to stay at Marieke's studio again, that's for sure!"
26256832,"Host - Anita gave us a warm welcome and was present when we checked in. She was also very flexible in storing our luggage after the check out time.<br/>Place - The place is much bigger and nicer than what it seems in the pictures - Entrance lobby, a big lounge with open plan kitchen, balcony,double bed room and separate toilet and bathroom. Rooms are all furnished and kitchen has all the utensils that you may need. Location - The house is in Western Amsterdam which is safe and quite and is  on second floor of the building and is 5 minutes walk from Lelylaan station [Tram 1 and 17 direct to city center, Sprinter in 6 minutes to Airport and also a Metro line]. It is also 5 minutes walk to the high street with grocery store etc. .<br/>Few other points - The place does not have a lot of storage space for the guests as it is already occupied. Entrance door is half transparent glass which may be a privacy concern for some people.<br/>Conclusion - I would recommend this place for a couple on budget for  3-4 days stay when you want to save some money by cooking yourself and still be not very far from the city center"
26257011,"I absolutely loved staying at Rosie's B&B. Her and her husband are lovely people and their house is very beautiful. The double room I was renting is stunning and perfectly clean.I would gladly recommend Rosie's B&B to all of my friends and colleagues.<br/>The neighbourhood is amazing, really classy and full of nice places to go out for a coffee or something to eat.<br/>I would definately stay again at their place if in Amsterdam.<br/>"
26279665,"Not so good place to stay, we were surprised by the very small room"
26292221,"A fantastic location in the heart of Amsterdam. 10min walk from museum square and dam square. 2mins from Rembrandt square and leidseplein. The boat is great, very cosy and warm even in December. You'll have everything you need on the boat and the hosts were great. There is a supermarket 2mins around the corner and a liquor store 4min walk away. The street is nice and quite, just far enough out of the main hustle and bustle of Amsterdam streets at night. The tram is super accessible so if you get tired of walking and taking in the atmosphere then you can jump on and off for a few pounds a day. Christmas in Amsterdam was beautiful and super relaxing and there is even a Marks and Spencers 15min walk away for a bit of a taste of home comforts if you want it. If you want somewhere to sit and watch the world go by whilst eating nice food there are plenty of places near by, especially in Rembrandt square where you can get a great breakfast at the Irish bar. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would go back in a heartbeat."
26304149,"Simon's place is well situated, walking distance to all museums and good restaurants and the Tram. He left excellent directions and we found his place easily. The apartment is well laid out for a couple the place had all the amenities a person could ask for. With all the restaurants so close we didn't make any meals there but it is perfect for cutting costs that way. I would stay there again.<br/>His upstairs neighbor Ruud and friend Allan helped us get set up as Simon was away."
26334858,Edwin was extremely kind and welcoming.  He told me about good neighborhood eats and even provided me w an electronic adapter since I had forgot to pack mine. Also...awesome neighborhood and location!! Central station a 15 min walk. The guest house is next to the iconic flower market (easy to find on a map/ask for directions).  There's a torus and tickets shop (the guys who sell hop on hop off bus) down the street if you want to by tickets for tours/attractions. Everything is close and the price is great and Edwin is a wonderful host. Would highly recommend!! 
26342923,Absolutely best location and best host in Amsterdam. Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Amsterdam.
26349511,"La habitación es tal y como se describe. Es un estudio precioso en un cuarto sin ascensor (escaleras muy empinadas), totalmente independiente con su baño. Cuenta con Wifi. Todo muy limpio. Tienes tu propia llave. Está en la parte alta del edificio. Una experiencia totalmente recomendable, pues durante unos días puedes vivir como un auténtico ciudadano de Ámsterdam. Es el típico edificio antiguo de la cuidad, que además tiene vistas a un canal, por lo que cada mañana mientras desayunas puedes disfrutar de las vistas. Para desayunar teníamos una cafetera con todo lo necesario (café, azúcar, leche, té, etc). Incluso tenía una pequeña nevera.<br/>La ubicación muy buena. Pegado a la plaza Leiseplein, por donde pasan los tranvías 1, 2 y 5 que van a la plaza Dam y a la estación, además de los autobuses que te llevan al aeropuerto. Mucho ambiente en la zona para cenar o ir a teatros. Los museos están a 5 minutos a pie. Al centro se llega caminando en 15 minutos.<br/>La anfitriona, Edith, muy amable, al llegar nos dió una explicación muy completa sobre la ciudad, que hacer, que ver, etc. Y además habla español. Antes de llegar también nos facilitó información sobre el transporte público para llegar a su casa. El último día nos permitió dejar las maletas hasta la hora de irnos, a pesar de que la avisamos muy tarde. En la habitación tiene un dossier con información y mapas de la ciudad por si alguien necesita.<br/>El precio es alto, pero al mismo nivel que el resto de la ciudad. Si volviese a Ámsterdam repetiría sin duda."
26372769,"Although I never got the chance to meet Caroline, she was very helpful with the booking and apartment info. Her friend Wieke was there upon arrival with some cold beers and great recommendations for things to do around the city. The apartment is absolutely gorgeous, even better than the pictures! Absolutely will stay here again. Thanks again! "
26385289,"This place is a very special place. Bob and Eve embraces you for who you are. They went the extra mile on everything. When I go back to Amsterdam, this is the only one place I will stay.. Just amazing! Amazing just amazing"
26418634,Adoramos nossa estada em Amsterdam!!! O apartamento não poderia ser melhor localizado! O ônibus que vem do aeroporto nos deixa praticamente na porta e pudemos ir a pé para todos os pontos turísticos  da cidade!!! O bairro é calmo e muito charmoso. O apartamento é uma graça e extremamente claro e limpo! Havia tudo que precisávamos e um banho bem gostoso. Robert foi muito atencioso! Vc só deve se preparar para subir as escadas (4 lances) com as suas malas o que realmente não chega a ser um problema quando pensamos nos benefícios e na vista que o local nos proporciona. Muito obrigada Robert!<br/>
26421772,"Edwin's place was perfectly located, close to all the attractions in Amsterdam. The room was spacious, cosy, warm and clean; everything a traveller wants!<br/><br/>Edwin was an absolutely fantastic host (my favourite host ever)!!! Super friendly and very fun and accommodating. Great for chatting to and hearing his stories. If you stay here, I definitely recommend getting to know Edwin if you get the chance!! He's a fantastic guy and a fantastic host and he really contributed to my positive experience of Amsterdam. :)"
26460077,"Marijn was a great host, and met us upon arrival mid day, taking time to explain how to get around and some of the sites.  The room also has several travel guides to Amsterdam in it, including some written by her friends. The area was great, the flat is located very close to central station, Dam square, and the red light district.  The museum district is a short bike ride or tram ride away.<br/>The flat itself is a loft style place(one room plus a bathroom) with a small kitchen with microwave and fridge.  It is fairly quiet for being so central."
26471194,"Wir wurden sehr freundlich empfangen, mit der Wohnung vertraut gemacht und über viele Dinge - z.B. Verkehrsanbindung, Einkaufsmöglichkeiten usw. informiert. Die Einrichtung der Wohnung war komplett und die Lage war in ruhiger Nachbarschaft."
26492382,"We had a short but perfect stay at the ship, everything was fine! A very good alternative for large groups instead of a hotel or hostel. Thank you!"
26501763,Corina gave us great tips about getting into the museums and a nice walking tour.  She also helped us with public transportation to and from her listing.  The room was very nice.
26509950,"We have stayed three nights at Mike's place. It was really an amazing stay and this home let us to experience a stay in a local area. The house is very clean and stylish, delicately decorated. Anything you need is available in this beautiful house. Mike has prepared clean towels, left us coffees, fruits and some breakfast in the fridge. The bed, pillows are extra comfortable. The location is perfect for chill and relaxing - just next to a beautiful parc. (If you open the windows you can relax with birds singing outside) and also so close to center.  Mike is a very thoughtful host. Absolutely we would love to come and stay again. "

26601365,"Eu e meu namorado ficamos muito satisfeitos com nossa estadia! O apartamento estava limpo, cheiroso e receptivo. Bem abastecido com produtos de necessidade básica, tais como sabonete e shampoo.<br/>David nos recebeu muito bem! O local conta ainda com mapas e outros panfletos com informações sobre a cidade.<br/>A localização é excelente, próximo de vários dos principais pontos da cidade.<br/>Quando fizemos a reserva pelo site, não havia a opção de café, mas foi facilmente resolvido junto ao anfitrião.<br/>Foi uma experiência muito agradável. :)"
26617283,"L'appartamento, in un ottima posizione, e' davvero bello e accogliente con un giardino che rende ancora più piacevole e rilassante il soggiorno.Wendy fin dal primo momento, e nelle giornate a seguire è stata gentile,disponibile ricca di suggerimenti che ci hanno permesso di trascorrere un meraviglioso weekend ad Amsterdam! Consigliatissimo. "
26618254,"La nostra permanenza da Maike è  stata perfetta, la zona è stupenda e l'appartamento riservato agli ospiti è molto accogliente e pertinente alla descrizione.La colazione preparata con cura da Maike è stata sempre ottima con prodotti di prima scelta.<br/>Il centro è facilmente raggiungibile con un bus frequente e super puntuale.<br/>Raccomando a chiunque voglia passare qualche giorno ad Amsterdam."
26633882,"Очень специфическое, но невероятно интересное жилье. Такое же интересное, как и его хозяйка. Меня все устроило, немного неудобно было лишь то, что санузел находится в другом доме."
26658483,"Laura and Arjan are great hosts, helpful,friendly, very welcoming, the accommodation is below their living area in their beautiful old character house, facing the canal in a quiet charming district only a short stroll into the Jordan then the centre of Amsterdam, we walked without difficulty with baggage from the central railway station to their place after arriving on an early flight and Arjan let us check in early, we had a breakfast basket delivered each morning that was more than plenty to load us up for a start to exploring Amsterdam, we had family staying at a newer hotel on the waterfront a short distance away their room was small and sterile and soulless so if you want the real deal experience of how the locals live book yourself in with Laura and Arjan you will not be disappointed. we had a later flight after checking out and was allowed to store our luggage in their house and we used Arjans taxi service to the airport for 25 euro, great value and saved us from the crowds of the railway station, so thanks again Laura and Arjan for making our stay in Amsterdam so pleasant and memorable, we will be back for sure. Stephen & Janet"
26675357,"Everything about RUST B&B was brilliant. Matthijs was lovely, the room was great (with a wonderful big bed which was perfect to crash in after a hard day's exploring) and the bathroom was better than my home one! Matthijs and Francina had even provided a book of their recommendations of places to eat which proved invaluable during our stay. RUST is also centrally located, which made travelling to see the sights a breeze. Will definitely be recommending them to friends, family and anyone who will care to listen."
26676029,"Ingo was so helpful with lots of communication prior to arrival, including detailed instructions about who to get to the nearest tram stop. We were tired after a busy week and it was great knowing all this, it couldn't have been easier, especially as we were met at the tram stop! The apartment is fabulous with amazing views of the canal and lots of space. Ingo had bought in some drinks for us already (including non-alcoholic wine for me during my pregnancy which was very kind) and his lists of recommendations of things to do/places to eat etc was really helpful. Overall we had a wonderful trip and hope to come back again!"
26679758,"Everything in the studio is perfect, comfortable, well equipped as it is described. The area is quite and perfect for a relaxed vacation.

But the overall experience is fine. <br/><br/>The location is pretty convenient to the city centre, few tram stop away (say 15mins) to the city centre, while on foot about 20-30mins. The neighborhood is quiet and comfortable but is pretty safe, just a 5 min walk to the tram station. <br/><br/>The host is getting sick on the days we stayed, not much time to chat around, hope she is getting better soon.

The location was amazing - on a quiet street so we could get away from the crowds, but only a 10-15 minute walk away from the town centre. You can easily walk from here to the Van Gogh museum, the famous downtown churches, and lots of areas with cool restaurants. We would definitely stay here again!"

Further to this, the the host provided us with three bikes! There was also a garden which is beautiful in the sun. I cannot fault anything about this apartment. If you're looking for a place to stay in Amsterdam, this is the perfect apartment. Thank you Annette! I hope we can stay in your apartment when we return next year! :)"
26871332,"Gastvrij ontvangen door Maaike.  <br/>We voelden ons gelijk thuis. Een mooi licht huis, zeer knus en kleurrijk ingericht.  Genoeg ruimte, praktische keuken, en een heerlijk bed. <br/>HET Absolute plus punt: BAD met jetstream.

26879836,"Looking back on our two week European vacation, four days at the boat was the highlight!  Hosts welcomed us with Dutch beer and an informative book about the sites near our boat.  That they provided 2 bikes made the stay wonderful."
26957477,"Amazing!! The apartment was in an awesome location and the beds were comfy, it was three people and we felt we had plenty of space.  Mirjam was so accommodating and I felt went above and beyond her duties as a host to make sure we had a great time. Tip: remember hotel heart of Amsterdam because you can see it from the street you are staying on. The stairs were really no big deal at all I felt.  My second time staying with Miriam in two years. The BEST host I've ever had. She is caring, considerate and completely understanding of our needs. Not to mentioned the apartment is beautiful, in an amazing area and is of historical nature.  Highly recommended!!"
26984326,It was a very quick stay but Olaf was very helpful and very nice as a host. The place is charming and exactly what we excepted with my friends. And oh my.. This top roof!!!! Awesome.<br/>Thanks again for this night at your place.

27067176,"This home is PERFECT ! It is larger than what it looks in the photos. The neighborhood seems to be from a fairy tale book. Overlooking the water with huge trees. Although we did not meet Heleen, we exchanged emails often and she was very helpful. The neighbors were also very kind ( specially when the taxi requested didn't show up to take us to the train station:)   <br/>We loved being at your home. Our kids were sad when we had to leave. We used the bikes every day to go to the Ferry, the kids jumped in the trampoline and spin around with the rings in the family room. The dryer came very handy for the three days we came back completely soaked! and so was the hair drier ( we dried the shoes with it:)<br/>We loved the neighborhood, the neighbors, being able to have the dutch experience with the bikes and the food. The view from the bay window is amazing! I would not hesitate to recommend this home to anybody, specially families :)"
27083493,"We hebben een fijn weekend doorgebracht in Amsterdam. Joke heeft een heerlijk appartement, met een rustige slaapkamer. Prima bed. Joke verzorgt een ontzettend lekker en uitgebreid biologisch ontbijt, waarvoor nog onze dank! <br/>In de straat vestigen zich in snel tempo leuke nieuwe cafe's en winkels, met openbaar vervoer of een ov-fiets ben je zo in andere wijken. <br/>Onze eerste ervaring met airbnb was erg positief. Het persoonlijk contact met Joke maakte dat we ons snel thuisvoelden.  <br/>Aanrader!"
27085538,"This is a great place to stay, centrally located, wonderful host. The place is small but well arranged and everything you need is there. Thanks Hein!<br/>PS it is very close to the metro, find the end of the street closest to the station. Google maps confused us."
27094059,"A great place to stay in a brilliant neighbourhood.  We stayed with our two children aged 11 and 7.  For Londoners - the area is a bit like Stoke Newington with a tram at the end of the road.  It's easy to get everywhere, yet feels authentically residential.  Mark is helpful, reliable and friendly.  "
27109746,"Daniel and Viola's communication was great from the start - always quick to respond and extremely helpful and friendly. Daniel was friendly and welcoming (even though we'd turned up 40 minutes earlier than planned!) and gave lots of helpful tips and a run down of the apartment. We didn't need to get in touch whilst we were there but we knew it would be extremely easy to do so. The apartment was lovely - well decorated and had everything we needed. All the windows make it feel so light and airy even when it was grey outside and the bed is really comfortable, it was lovely to just lie in bed and look out the window at the canal. The neighbourhood is quiet and a little far out from town - 20/25 minute walk to the centre but the walk is nice and there's a tram stop less than 5 minutes from the front door so everything is easily accessible. We had such a great time and apartment was one of our favourite parts of the trip! Thank you so much guys!"
27117654,"In a few places you feel that you are not just a number or an income...And it was the case in this place. Joke is a wonderful host, kind and helpful. She even looked for us bus timetables before our day of departure so we may not be late. The location is just perfect, 10 mn from downtown and with a supermarket open late at night and a few restaurants and even a bar so if you don't want to be back late, there a plenty of options with a lot of buses and tramway around.<br/>The room is quiet, spotless and very cosy as the rest of the flat. Joke is flexible and her breakfast yummy ;+)<br/>We would highly recommend this accomodation and would love to come back and to take the time to exchange more with Joke and have a diner in her place..."
27143396,"Andrea war eine wirklich nette Gastgeberin. Sie hat eine ganze Mappe voll mit Tipps rund um Amsterdam zusammengestellt, die wir wirklich sehr hilfreich fanden! Bei unserer Ankunft wurden wir sogar mit einer leckeren Suppe versorgt - worüber wir uns nach dem doch recht langen Anreisetag sehr gefreut haben! <br/>Wir haben das Zimmer, welches genauso wie in den Bildern aussieht, sehr genossen. (Bloß die Matratzen waren für unseren Geschmack etwas zu weich!) Ich würde Andrea's Zimmer definitiv weiterempfehlen! :)"
27176717,Super séjour à Amsterdam dans ce studio très mignon et bien équipé. Le quartier est agréable et proche de tout . Hein nous a donné pleins de bons conseils ! <br/>On reviendra sans hésiter ! <br/>Dank u Hein :)
27182045,"The room was as lovely, if not lovelier, than the photos.  The neighbourhood is great, with the market just half a block away - we bought fresh strawberries that were perfect!  Also, the host showed us the restaurant market which is also 1/2 block away, and it was terrific!"
27186111,"The good:  Arjan was very nice and left instructions on how best to get to and from the center of the city.  The apartment was good size and newly renovated. <br/>The bad:  apartment is on the 4th floor of an extremely old building with old stairs which are very steep. Not an easy haul if you have a lot of luggage. Very little water pressure in the shower.  Also, despite the fact that his apartment was very clean the inside of the building looks very dirty which is fine, except at $190 a night I expected much more luxurious accommodation. Although the apartment is very close to public transportation (2 minutes walking) if you plan on staying out late (you're in Amsterdam!) plan on €20 minimum via taxi to get back to the apartment. <br/>No way the place is worth $190/night!"
27231491,"Corina was fantastic!! The studio beautiful as on the pictures, very clean, amazing location, very cute garden. My friend and I had a fantastic stay. We would stay any time again at Corina's:-)) "
27253438,"Great Host Sally!  She's very nice and kind, big apartment with all the staf needed and well cleaned. Very recommended!"
27257777,"Olaf is a passionate host. He is easygoing and would like to share his experience of travelling. He cooked us dinner and served us tea and coffee. His house is like a comic museum, if you also like comic books and would like to make new friend during your stay then I will recommend you stay here."
27275576,Marion was very sweet and kind! She was super helpful with directions and offered use of her bikes to get around the city. Her home is beautiful and I hope to go back someday! 
27359042,"De kamer beantwoordde helemaal aan de verwachtingen: aangenaam, eenvoudig gemeubileerd, rustig, ruim, netjes, goed warm, prachtige douche met héél speciale glastegeltjes (!), voorzieningen om zelf ontbijt klaar te maken of een maaltijd op te warmen.<br/>Wilbert is een bijzonder vriendelijke, behulpzame en communicatieve gastheer. Ik voelde me meteen thuis. We hadden een paar aangename gesprekken.<br/>Heel rustige straat met stijlvolle panden; vlakbij zijn winkels, cafés, restaurants, warenhuizen in overvloed. Op wandelafstand van Vondelpark, Museumplein, Concertgebouw.<br/>Een aanrader dus!<br/>"
27368170,Debbie was friendly and welcoming. Nice neighbor hood. Room was clean and bright. The very steep and narrow stairway is an issue especially with luggage.
27399609,"We felt very wellcome, our hosts were extremely helpful and generous. The room was cosy, comfortable and very clean with all necessary furnishing and facilities. We particularly enjoyed the interesting area of Borneo island, which is full of extraordinary achitectural features and also very quiet, peaceful and relaxing. Its not far from the city center, easily accessible by bus. We can truly recommend this accommodation. "
27436826,The house was big and the room very comfortable. It is a quiet and beautiful neighborhood at five minutes walking to the trams. Enith is a lovely person who opened the house for my wife and me. She had breakfast with us and gave us a ride to the city while she described it. We fully recommend this place to visit Amsterdam. We definitely come back to her place in our next trip to the Netherlands.
27474304,"Toetsie est adorable, la maison etait charmante, pleine de petits objets et de traces de vie. Vous profitez d'une reelle autonomie d'une petite cuisine et d'une salle de bain ainsi que de toilettes sur le meme palier.<br/>Personne ne se dérange dans cette maison, haute toute en étage !"
27496487,"My friend and I had an excellent stay in Amsterdam! David's place is very clean and comfortable--and is exactly as lovely as the photos. The location is absolutely perfect, just a 6 minute walk to Centraal station. David was very friendly and helpful, and he was easy to reach. I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a great value in Amsterdam!"
27497522,"good location , close to central station. David is very nice host and give right instruction. I like the place. "
27500809,"That was a very good trip. The apartment is so cosy, 10min to the center, 2 to supermarket, and all commodities, clean, spacious, perfect ;)<br/>Thank you ingo to receive us for the weekend. <br/>If we have to come back in Amsterdam, be sure we would like stay here. <br/>"
27534394,"Lovely apartment in just the desired area! Bronte's instructions were easy to follow and we discovered an welcome package on arrival with all the needed information. Great amenities in the kitchen, bathroom and both bedrooms. Nice neighbourhood and good location for Amsterdam travelers. Would recommend, thanks again! "
27621653,"I had a very good stay at Edwin's house. Booking and check-in arrangements went very smoothly.<br/>The room was all conform to the description: comfortable, in a central and lively location. All good!"
27638158,"Laura and Arjan were excellent hosts.  The basement apartment was lovely and clean and had all the amenities we needed to enjoy our stay.  The quiet location is within 10 minutes walking distance to pretty much anything (Central Station, shops etc).  <br/><br/>They had tourist brochures available for us to look at in deciding what we wanted to do - and there is so much to do!  <br/><br/>Each morning there was a great basket of breakfast goodies delivered  such as croissants, cheese, fruit, yogurt, as well as lattes and orange juice.  <br/><br/>We enjoyed our stay there so much and we hope to come back.  I would highly recommend this stay.  <br/><br/>Thank you!  "
27653354,Big and clean appartment. Micha is a pleasant host and the location was perfect for our stay in Amsterdam! We will come again!
27658519,"We spent a lovely long week end at Bronte's place : it was very cosy, the neibourghood was calm and pleasant especially with the park nearby.<br/>We felt taken care of as everything was waiting for us :)<br/><br/>Thank you very much Bronte, all the best !"
27724970,"Bonsoir, très bon accueil de Viola,  nous nous sommes sentis comme chez nous dans cet appartement, nous avons adoré avoir la vue sur le canal, cuisiner local, circuler à vélo dans cette ville pleine de charme, découvrir le musée Van Gogh, très envie de revenir dans cette ville en hiver... Amicalement Ghislaine et Pierre-Jean"
27747824,El piso es exactamente como se anuncia y más perfecto imposible! Las camas más cómodas del universo! Nos sentimos como en casa y la ubicación es simplemente inmejorable. Lo recomiendo a todo el mundo y ya tenga ganas de volver!
27785722,"L'appartement de Leontine est génial, très spacieux et lumineux. Il correspond tout à fait aux photos publiées sur le site. <br/>Il est très bien placé, dans un quartier calme et agréable, et assez près du centre d'Amsterdam où l'on peut se rendre à pied ou en tram.<br/>Je recommande vivement cet appartement pour ceux qui souhaitent profiter d'Amsterdam tout en se sentant bien dans son logement!"
27802036,Olaf is a great host and the apartment is like a fantasy - Mickey mouse and comic characters on almost every items at every corner! We had 2 people using both of the rooms and it was very comfortable and cosy. The location is great too and the Tram 4 can take u to almost everywhere. We loved it and highly recommend it to others!
27817041,"Ingo was an excellent host. Very friendly and helpful and was available upon our arrival. <br/>The apt was clean, spacious and was in a central location. <br/>Really enjoyed our stay there and would come back again. Thanks Ingo for everything. "
27845628,Superb host and accommodation! Wieger was exceptionally helpful and eager to ensure a comfortable stay in their lovely home. Great location and very comfortable home!
27886929,"Nous étions 4 collègues à vouloir visiter Amsterdam et notre baptême airbnb est une réussite!!  Cécile a été une hôte idéale: l'appartement (situé dans un quartier calme) était nickel pour notre arrivée, tous les petits accessoires de Cécile a disposition (dont un sèche cheveux très pratique pour alléger nos valises :) Les petits déjeuners pour notre séjour étaient aussi prêts. Un dossier avec tous pleins d'info sur Amsterdam nous attendait mais nous avions déjà reçu un mail sympa sur toutes les activités et sorties possibles. Bref, nous remercions Cecile de nous avoir accordé sa confiance, et d'avoir répondu à toutes nos questions avant le séjour! N'hésitez vraiment pas, en tout cas, nous ne sommes pas déçus :)<br/>Merci beaucoup Cécile!!!<br/>"
27892099,"Goede locatie en zeer goed prijs-kwaliteit verhouding. Zeer goede communicatie voor check-in en check-out te laten verlopen, zeer vriendelijke mensen!<br/><br/>"
27904149,"The place was nice and comfortable- also well located. My main concern was the wifi, which was really poor. Also, I never met Naomi, only the IamBnb team, which were very helpful. However the family photo is deceptive and given the size of the place it is obvious a family couldn't live there. Besides that my stay was great! Thanks."
27916674,"Local de fácil acesso ao centro e pontos turísticos, bairro residencial, quarto bom como esperado, banheiro compartilhado com outro hóspede, mas quanto a isso nenhum problema. Anfitriã brasileira comunicativa e que nos deu várias dicas da cidade. O inconveniente era a descarga do vaso sanitário, que fazia muito barulho e inibia o uso durante a noite, e a cobrança de uma taxa extra de 15 euros/dia não prevista no airbnb.<br/>3 lances de escadas para subir com malas, mas como viajávamos com malas leves, isso não foi um problema. A internet wifi nunca conectou. Por sorte tinha um Starbucks a duas quadras, onde conseguíamos conectar normalmente."
27985175,Our stay with Laura was wonderful. Laura and Arjan made us feel very welcomed and they were warm and friendly hosts. The location is beautiful and the amenities provided were more than sufficient. The location is also convenient as public transportation is available easily. We also enjoyed the amazing breakfast provided for us daily.0 We had a perfect stay there and would recommend it to anyone who is looking to have a wonderful experience in Amsterdam.
27993189,I would like to come again to this wonderful boat house
27995960,"Micha was very nice and helpful host. He can speak English well and very responsive to all our concerns. The apt was exactly as described and seen on pictures. We requested for trash bin in the bathroom and bath towels and he happily provided them the next day. Micha also provided some food we can eat as we arrived quite late. The apt was accessible to train station, just 5-10 minutes walk. Thanks Micha!"
28010407,"Marijke is very friendly and helpful. The room is clean, and the bathroom is equiped with good sanitary wares. The location is very convenient and but quiet in the meanwhile. You would find some small artistic decoration of the room:-)  I would recommend this flat, though a little cold in the room in this season."
28016159,Excellent week-end in Amsterdam. The boat is really romantic and confortable. 50 meters away from Jordaan and very near from the centrum. Mijs is very kind and disponible. 
28062039,"I had a really great time at karlijn's apartment. The apartment is well located, close to Vondelpark and a nice canal with many stores. Karlijn will make you feel home and is really welcoming. The apartment is cosy and decorated with taste. I recommend this place! Thanks Karlijn! "
28066346,"David's place was absolutely perfect! The location is excellent, room was spotless clean and beautifully done with amenities as described in the listing. We had a very comfortable stay and will pick David's place if we visited Amsterdam again! "
28073449,"Beautiful place, great location, excellent host. But, the most ridiculously treacherous staircase we've ever dealt with. Pack light and this studio is perfect."
28104185,"Great, clean and light apartment in a great location. Julie was extremely helpful through all stages and could not have asked for more from a host! All in all a great experience, I would highly recommend a stay with Julie!"
28158374,Amazing!! Ifigenia was so sweet and helpful. I could not have asked for a better host!! The apartment was perfect too: great location and clean and wonderful! 
28168189,"Location of Sander's place was good and view was amazing. Place had all Sander's things in it including closet full of his clothes. Place didn't feel like home at all. At least not for the price we paid. Sander also has NEST thermostat  and regulates temperature of apartment from his phone. I wasn't comfortable with 16C at night and during day time, but he kept changing it. I was super cold all day and night we stayed there and had to sleep in my clothes. Not the best experience for the price he paid. "
28172958,Great location. Extremely convenient with bus 34. Everything was perfect though Jeroen had prior commitments when we entered. We met him on the last day for a while but had no barrier what so ever. Highly recommended. 
28178348,"Logeren bij joke was geweldig: warm welkom, duidelijke afspraken, goede tips, kraaknette kamers en zalig lekker en uitgebreid ontbijt. Een aanrader!"
28204721,The room was quite small for 3 pax.. The location was ok 
28205553,"What a wonderful place. Comfort house (cozy bedrooms, extremely well equipped kitchen, bright living spaces), and, obviously - the terrace - on a water:-) And very quite:-) Cozy place:-) Host was very friendly and provided everything what we expected and what was needed for a stay - food for breakfast, WiFi and bicycles;-)<br/><br/>Neighborhood was fairly quite what gave us perfect night rest after long work days.<br/><br/>Highly recommended:-)"
28213968,"Mike is such a great host, he kept an eye out for our arrival and carried our case up the steep stairs.  As soon as we arrived we felt very welcome and comfortable in the beautiful apartment. Everything is exactly how it looks in the pictures - top marks for decor and attention to detail, it really makes it feel special! <br/>We very much appreciated the Espresso machine and essentials waiting for us in the fridge. <br/>It's a perfect little place to relax in and enjoy the local area. We enjoyed spending time in De Pijp for breakfast and dinner with such a wide selection of places to check out. <br/>Getting to and from the airport was pretty easy. The center is a 20minute walk but we decided to hire bikes which was great fun and easy enough once you get used to the local pace.<br/>All in all, a fantastic experience, we'd love to visit again!  This is our second stay at Mike's place, and everything was exactly as and just as beautiful as 9 years ago. We love the area, it is so peaceful yet has so many cafes, bars and restaurants nearby to chose from. The area is so well connected by public transport, but it's very easy to wander through the streets and across bridges and find yourself in the heart of the action. Museumplein is less than a 20minute walk. <br/>The apartment is perfect for our needs, a relaxing place with everything you need for a pleasant break. <br/>Mike is a great host, nothing is an issue, our flight was initially cancelled so our arrival time was later than expected, but it was no problem keeping in touch with Mike. <br/>We hope to be back again in the future!"
28287050,"We had a fantastic time staying at this apartment. The bed was very comfortable and the space itself was beautiful. There is a little shared patio space through the back door (although we unfortunately never got to use it due to the rain!). The kitchenette was very useful and the shower always had hot water.<br/><br/>It was very easy getting into central Amsterdam. We took a tram which was about a five minute walk from the apartment. There also was a grocery store within walking distance as well. <br/><br/>Marloes and Gabriel were great hosts and kind to us. They were very accommodating and easy to contact for questions or directions. They even let us borrow bikes on our last day, where we biked through Sloterpark (which we found even more beautiful than Vondelpark), which was located literally right behind the house. <br/><br/>Overall amazing stay!<br/>"
28358935,"This is by far the best Airbnb experience we've had thus far. Every detail was carefully considered - from the pick up and drop off at the airport to the wonderful breakfast served each morning, Laura and Arjan really know how to show people a good time. If you get the opportunity to stay in their place your in luck. We have already started recommending our friends and family to stay with Laura and Arjan when they are next in Amsterdam. "
28406169,"We enjoyed the home of Ton and Fede, its location in Amsterdam, the space bright and friendly kitchen. Easy welcome and a special mention for  helpful Helen. Some practical suggestions: living room coffee table side, an easel to put his clothes si de bedroom ... even without that we will return if possible. Thanks with our best wishes for 2016"
28409047,Laura and Arjan were perfect hosts. The apartment and the location were also very good. I would definitely recommend to stay here! 
28429402,"What a gorgeous apartment and what wonderful hosts! The apartment is located smack in the middle of a very hip neighborhood with amazing cafés and restaurants in walking distance to everything. The hosts were in touch with in minutes of writing and were very accommodating with special wishes. The apartment is equipped with everything a traveler needs, spices, salad dressing, espresso machine, etc. It was superclean and it's very cozy. I would come back any time!"
28465128,Laura and her husband were extremely nice. Relentlessly positive and helpful. I can not say enough for how much their friendliness made an impact on our stay. The apartment is in a great location and is very well equipped and comfortable. I highly recommend it!
28491357,"From the moment we booked this place David was very welcoming. He provided very clear instructions of how to get to the apartment from various travel methods. <br/>When we arrived David greeted us and provided great advice on sights, maps and things to do. <br/>The apartment itself is exactly as pictured. Clean, comfortable and very close to the central station and sights. <br/>We would highly recommend this place for anyone visiting Amsterdam! Thank you David "
28499623," La chambre de David et bien celle décrite. Avec un triple avantage à mes yeux. D'abord disposer d'une entrée sur rue en marge de l'appartement de l'hôte (que je n'ai vu qu' à la remise des clés à l'arrivée et pour convenir des modalités du départ). Ensuite offrir une grande surface , bien aménagée, avec une bonne literie pour deux et au calme . Enfin être située en plein dans le centre, l'endroit  le plus vivant et le plus jeune d'Amsterdam, ce qui réduit les longs déplacements à pieds, à condition évidemment de ne pas trop s'offusquer des charmantes dames posant derrière leurs vitrines à proximité. L'escalier est sans doute un peu raide, mais une fois les valises montées, celà ajoute au charme plus que centenaire du lieu.<br/>Christian"
28524397,"S is a really nice host, she gave me lots of advice about traveling in this city, and she offered lots of help when I faced problems. She's really really nice. And the room is comfortable, the bed is big, and I can find everything I need. It is easy to get to city center by tram. Everything living in this room is wonderful. Love it."
28549348,A very Nice place with a lovely decoration ! The flat has a great localisation because 20 min by walk to the center and the neighborhood is very Nice. <br/>The only negative point is the cats who made their excrements on the floor of the flat and broke some things. <br/>Thank you Brenda for your kindness.
28576863,The best place to be! thank you David. The apartment is very nice and very well located. Also the breakfast was good. 
28606090,"Die Unterbringung war super, gemütlich und sauber und wir haben uns sehr wohl und willkommen gefühlt. Die Lage der Wohnung ist einfach toll, mitten im Leben dieser erstaunlichen Stadt. Wir haben viele Infos über die Stadt und die öffentlichen Verkehrsmittel bekommen, Stadtpläne und eine Chipkarte für die Tram und genaue Beschreibungen, wo wir finden, was wir suchen. Toll. Es gab sogar einen Geburtstagskuchen mit Kerze und Ständchen für unsere Tochter. Vielen Dank, Joke. Wir kommen gern mal wieder. <br/>Larissa, Holger und Maja"
28606363,Lydia was amazing. She greeted us with the biggest smile and warmest welcome. We had red wine frim her and lots of items in the fridge for a continental breakfast. She gave us directions for local attractions and made us feel very very at home. The boat is so beautiful and we r booking again for the summer. Its so central but far enough away to have a peaceful night sleep. Cannot recommend enough and miss the boat and Lydia already. Brilliant romantic break x
28618057,"Wij hebben een leuke tijd achter de rug bij Marian en Simon. Zoon Sjoerd heeft ons hartelijk ontvangen. Ook de communicatie vooraf en tijdens ons verblijf verliep heel vlot.<br/>De kamers waren proper, de bedden lagen goed en de badkamer was erg netjes. Dat we 's ochtends voor vertrek naar de stad konden genieten van een koffie of thee op onze kamer, was zeker een pluspunt.<br/>Kortom: logeren bij Marian en Simon is een aanrader voor wie wil genieten van een zorgeloos verblijf!<br/>"
28623096,"We had a wonderful stay in Amsterdam at Heleen's apartment. The apartment is on a great location with views of the Amstel River and is a short walk to some wonderful restaurants. The apartment was very nice and perfect for our 5 night stay. Heleen was very helpful and gave us some great recommendations, and we enjoyed chatting with her for a bit, learning about the area! "
28629475,"Caspar was there to greet us when we arrived at the apartment. The direction to the apartment was straight forward. The place is located about 15 minutes bus ride from central station. It is nice and by the water but our room was right by the street with back door facing the water. We spent only one night because we were travelling early the next morning. Caspar brought us breakfast before we left. Overall, a good place to stay but we couldn't sleep because two people in a car parked outside our room talked all night until around 5 am. The bedroom is just to close to the street."
28647598,"Olaf is a kind and welcoming person, he made us coffee, tea and warm Stroopwafel :) We had interesting discussions and sound advices as he knows very well the city.<br/>The flat is in accordance with the pictures, colourful and tidy. We definitively feel at ease, especially during the foot massage which was the best to start our day ! <br/>The district is nice and peaceful. There are some typical cafés around and the city centre is very close."
28648186,"The apartment suited us well. Having two bedrooms and two bathrooms was awesome. Lots of hot water.The beds were really comfortable. The kitchen was well equipped. The location-within walking distance of Amsterdam Central, and just down the street from the bus and tram stop was a bonus. The apt. was very close to two grocery stores. Nice welcome from Nathalie, her husband and her friend. Gave us lots of information re sights to see and museums to visit.<br/>We definitely recommend Nathalie's spot!<br/><br/>"
28662834,"very interesting apartment. We had a wonderful staying at Olaf place. The rooms are clean, perfect and comfortable.  Wi-Fi accessible, the location is great. Less than 5 mins walk to tram station and around 15mins tram to centraal station. Several supermarkets nearby. Olaf is nice and helpful. Long stairs for luggages,  but Olaf help a lot!"
28731648,"Hein nous a très bien reçu, il avait préparé une carte d'Amsterdam et avec nous ils nous a indiquer tous les endroits qu'il était sympathique de visiter y compris des lieux que l'on ne trouve pas dans les guides. Hein parle couramment français, ce qui est agréable. <br/>Le studio est conforme à la description, tout est bien pensé et aménagé.<br/>Le quartier est calme et facile d'accès. Hein envoie avant l'arrivé tout l'itinéraire pour arrivé chez lui. Le centre ville est accessible a pied (10 min) ou en métro et bus."
28742109,"We really enjoyed our stay in Viola & Daniel's place. Such a clean, bright, cozy and stylish place. Every detail was made with love in this apartment. Unfortunately, we didn't meet Viola,but we met Daniel, who was very helpful and friendly. The neighborhood was incredible! Just near Westerpark and 15 min from the centre. Me and my husband are very happy that we chose this place to stay in this great city. We are highly recommend you this apartment, because you wouldn't find any better!"
28782319,Marga and her family were lovely and shared great tips about the city as well as advice on good places to go to see the city. Being a few minutes outside of the center was a nice getaway and the bike into town was easy and a beautiful way to get some extra sight seeing in! 
28788261,"This is a fantastic place to stay in Amsterdam. We really liked the neighbourhood, Sebastian was very welcoming and gave us lots of great recommendations of places to see and eat at. Great shower and comfy bed. Very easy to get to using public transport. Would definitely recommend!"
28812356,"This is perfect for a young romantic couple.<br/>The flat is very cool, with lot of sunshine coming out of something like 7-8 windows and an  amazing view from the 3rd floor on the canals.<br/>The apartment is well furnished, you'll find everything you need, Viola and Daniel where nice hosts, always available and helpful.<br/>The location is optimal, as it is close both to the traditional tourist centre and also areas where the locals chill out.<br/>A couple of quick cons that might surprise some:<br/>- no lift and very narrow stairs, but fairly common in Amsterdam.<br/>- No bathroom door.<br/>Overall we where satisfied and can recommend the apartment."
28835046,"Riks seems like a good host - he welcomed us to the house with a smile and even recommended some places to visited. His house is in a super convenient location just 7 minutes walk way from Amsterdam Centraal station. You can also get to most of the sight seeing places in less than 30 minutes or so. Included breakfast was eggs, bread, cheese and meat and was available until noon which is nice. There we other guest at the house when we were staying there, but they were really quiet and we only saw them at the breakfast table.<br/><br/>Sadly, there were some downsides to this place as well. The two the really stuck out were (and are related) was heating and hot water. The room is heated via a single small radiator which took a while to change the temperature of the room even on the ""max"" setting and it never quite got warm enough for my Californian liking. Additionally, the radiators would go cold at night so the temperature in the room would drop. Luckily, we were provided with giant covers that helped us fight the night, but we still wished we had better heated room. Second, hot water was an issue as well for showering. We could not take early morning showers as there was no hot water (I am guessing the same heater controls water for room heating and water for the shower). Once we finally did get some water, it was only for a 5-10 minute shower, so the second person half way into their shower would get scolded with freezing water. That does not seem like much, but after hours of walking in  cold Amsterdam all we wanted was a nice long hot shower."
28842675,"Corina was very hospitality and enthusiasm host. The house location was very best and convenient. Especially the bed was very comfortable, the bath room is very great. we are very satisfied with the room."
28861847,"Debby was a great host. From the beginning of our planning stages, she was very communicative and helpful with all of our questions.  When we arrived, she greeted us and provided us with helpful information re transportation and other questions we had during our stay.  We only saw her a few times throughout our stay, but each time, she was very kind to assist us and was always very responsive to our contact through the site with questions while we were out and about site seeing.  <br/>The room was great - it was very clean and comfortable and provided great privacy. The bed was comfortable and the space was just enough.  We appreciated all the thoughtful touches upon our arrival - bottles of water, fresh flowers and the stroopwafels. This was our first experience using Airbnb and definitely made for a great first impression! Thank you Debby for your hospitality!"
28871645,"Toetsie is the ideal host!! She welcomed us warmly and we really felt at home in her lovely house, I absolutely loved the arty decoration. I loved her care about details that made our trip easier: the metro card, the map, any useful tips she could give us. <br/>And a big plus for the lovely organic ingrédients to cook breakfast and the bottle of wine. My boyfriend even had a bottle of local beer for his birthday!<br/>The house is not too far from the metro and a bit of walk to the centre, and in a very quiet neighbourhood. <br/>Thank you Toetsie!!"
28874589,"I very much enjoyed the location of this apartment.  Very easy to find from the airport and easy to navigate the city from.  David was my kind of host--there when I needed him, provided a clean space as advertised, and a nice breakfast each morning.  His instructions on how to access the apartment were easy to follow, and recommendations to get around town were great.  This place is very close to the craziness of De Wallen, but tucked away on the perfect little corner so you can forget that the hustle and bustle is there.  I had been in Europe for over 2 weeks, and the laundromat around the corner was a highly desired bonus.  Highly recommend this place!"
28893019,"Firstly people in Amsterdam are the friendliest I have met by far, NOT the host though. <br/>Peter wasnt 100%(not even 60%), gave us the impression he was rushing off hence had very short attention span(the most unfriendly host we have met after many Airbnb experiences). The only nice part was the welcome wine & snack.<br/>Please keep in mind you will only get 1/5 of the whole boat, very small. <br/>We were sneezing a lot as the bed was very dusty. <br/>We informed we were half an hour late to check out, our luggages were already removed and placed at the exit. That wasn't impressive as we don't appreciate our personal belongings to be touched with words of Sarcasm and unpleasant expression. <br/>I chose this from the reviews, am disappointment as was very excited. Oh well, we will definitely visit Amsterdam many times after but will not stay here. Please improve Peter and friend, thanks. *i've always review with good words, too bad for this time<br/>"
28906513,"Voyager avec un bébé n'est pas toujours facile, Laura a tout mis à notre disposition pour nous aider. Famille super accueillante, emplacement idéal proche du centre à pied, logement vraiment top, très propre, cosy. "
28920144,"The neighbourhood was lovely.  Quiet, calm and it was fun to see the families going to school/work on their bikes in the morning.  Cafes and shops close by were great.  The city centre was an easy walk.  Hanneke and her husband made us feel very welcome.  The houseboat was basic but very comfortable."
28926297,"Naomi's place was great.  The hosts accomodated us for check-in, provided us with essentials, and even left some treats and coffee.  The apartment was clean and about a 20 min walk to the center of the town.  Thanks a lot everyone!"
28929159,"Vibeke was lovely and very helpful providing us with maps, information and advice for our visit.  We spent time with her on our arrival but didn't see her much after although she was always reachable on whatsapp for any questions or advice. The room was lovely and comfortable for me and my 2 children. We also made full use of the kitchen .There are 2 tram lines very close to the apartment which took us everywhere we needed to go during our week long visit. Tram tickets if bought for several days are not expensive. Thank you for helping us have a lovely holiday."
28931138,"Wir haben die Unterkunft gut gefunden und wurden von Wilbert herzlich empfangen. Das Zimmer ist geräumig und schön ruhig nach hinten raus zum Innenhof gelegen. Schön das man einen separaten Eingang hat. Besonders hat uns gefallen, das er zwei Fahrräder mit anbietet. Das ist unkompliziert und er hat gute Tipps für schöne Touren z.B. ins Umland von Amsterdam. Ideal auch die Lage des Zimmers, den Vondelpark erreicht man in wenigen Minuten und auch die beiden großen Museen sind mit einem Spaziergang zu erreichen. Wir haben uns hier sehr wohl gefühlt. <br/><br/>Antje & Frank <br/> "
28950214,"Loved staying in this nice appartment, perfectly situated within walking distance of Vondelpark (nice to do some running, have a nice picknick or just chill!!) and also city centre is within easy reach. Thanks Karlijn for your great hospitality and suggestions for drinks and dinner. Defenitely would stay at your place again. Highly recommended!"
28957628,"This was our first Airbnb experience, and it was great! The apartment is in a great location, near to the tram line and all the sights and amenities. Rosie was a fantastic host, who gave good advice on things to do and see - while making our stay a pleasure. <br/><br/>The room was spacious, and comfortable, with a great bed, and the breakfast Rosie offers was more than adequate. We will definitely be back."
28963823,"Joke has been a great host, waiting for us at time of arrival. The apartment is so nice, looks even better than in the pictures, with a really nice view.<br/>We've definitely felt at home, she took really great care of us. We hope to see her in Italy :)"
28986355,"Staying at the cozy home of Marga was magic.  I felt very welcomed there, and the cabin/house are beautiful.  Use of the bike was great, and I had a very powerful aura-reading session with Marga.  Definitely stay here if you can."
29020776,"It was a wonderful time spent in Umayya's flat! This place is charming: unique apartments design, everything is permeated with love of Umayya and her daughter, so sweet!<br/>The flat is well-equipped, clean and warm.<br/>Umayya is the best host I have ever had! Extremely caring and attentive!<br/>"
29022601,"This apartment is fantastic, the location is ideal and the view of the canal is so relaxing. It really feels like a home away from home.<br/>Lovely restaurant and bars close by (try Louis, lovely food here) . Evert is a brilliant host, and really makes you feel welcome."
29079537,"Jeroen ha affidato a me e ad un mio amico un bellissimo appartamento, accogliente e soprattutto pulito, dotato di tutto ciò che ci serviva. La zona è tranquilla, accessibile e molto particolare, con un supermercato vicinissimo all'abitazione e una fermata dell'autobus a pochi passi dall'alloggio.<br/> Jeroen ci ha dato inoltre molti consigli riguardo la città che ci hanno soddisfatto e che sono stati molto utili per il nostro viaggio. <br/><br/>Jeroen give to me and my friend a fantastic appartament, comfortable and very clean, that has all we need. The place is peaceful, close to the centre and very nice, we had a supermarket  very close to the house with a bus stop in front of it. <br/>Jeroen gave us a lot of advice about the city that help us a lot and that were very helpful."
29083127,"Karlijn is a wonderful host with a nice cosy apartment in a beautiful city! The surrounding is filled with places that we liked, really nothing to complain.<br/>We felt very comfortable and welcome and would like to com back.<br/>Thank you Karlijn!"
29086846,A nice place to stay. Convenient and close to the metro station. Micha was very friendly and helpful.  He waited for us at the apartment on our arrival and explained everything to us. Would recommend others to stay at Micha's place.
29088046,"It was very nice and quite room. Petra was the best host ever. She was totaly nice and helpful. We will probably come again in the future. Neighborhood was also perfect. Right infront of our door was little place to drink good beer and eat good food. :)<br/><br/>So for us it was perfect. :)<br/><br/>Thank you :)"
29093036,"I had a warm welcome and was shown around the flat. Later we shared wine and had a nice talk. I was there on business so I needed a place close to the center of Amsterdam. This is the first floor of Toetsies apartement so you are in her house. She is living upstairs and you will not hear or see her unless you want to. The place is very quiet even in the middle of Amsterdam. One reason is probably that most people use bycycles to get around, so the traffic is minor. I slept very well and enjoyed tea, breakfast and quiet morning time by myself. I had a small living room, bedroom, kitchen, bath and toilet for myself. There is another bedroom with more beds, but I do not know if she rents out this. Toetsie helped me finding the way around by walking and by tram.<br/>The only problem are the steep stairs to the flat. For me no problem. <br/>Like all AirBNB places I have been to, this place was nicer and cleaner than most hotels. The bed was large and comfortable. You have all the equipment you need.<br/>If you want to learn how it is to be living in the Netherlands, Toetsies flat is a good choice. I am very much looking forward to come back to Toetsie."
29115469,"It was our first time to Amsterdam and Toetsie's place was a great choice. She is a very friendly and nice host with a charming spirit. Apartment is very clean and organised, public transportation is couple minutes walking distance, there are nice cafes, restaurants and great oosterpark around the neighborhood and there is Roky the ginger cat, who is a real gem:) <br/>We could not ask for more.<br/>Strongly recommend and we will definitely be back. <br/>Thank you for sharing your place with us Toetsie."
29121245,"Frank ha sido verdaderamente amable. Se adaptó a nuestro horario de llegada, y nos dejó preparado material para la visita, además de otros detalles como agua o snacks, cafetera.<br/>La cama era muy cómoda y la calefacción funcionaba perfectamente. <br/>Disponíamos de nuestra propia llave y el piso era muy acogedor. Situado a pocos pasos de The Hallen, uno de los sitios más trendy en Amsterdam. El barrio es muy bueno. Todo estaba limpio y Frank nos dejó también toallas y paraguas. <br/>Ha sido una gran experiencia! Y volvería a repetir en este piso sin dudarlo.<br/><br/>Sólo una nota, tened en cuenta que el apartamento está en una segunda planta sin ascensor."
29157806,"Sarah's apartment was perfect! It is well equipped and in a lovely, quiet location. Loved the little welcoming touches Sarah left such as tea and coffee! We would not hesitate to recommend this awesome home to anyone else. Loved every bit of our stay. All communication was quick and efficient with Sarah. A perfect stay, thank you Sarah!"
29165039,"Karlijn was a truly wonderful host. Her apartment was charming and she made us feel both comfortable and welcome. Karlijn left us directions and recommendations for dining and exploring and her apartment was both cute and clean. The apartment  is located in the perfect area for exploring Amsterdam's city center. It is also located directly across from a park that is perfect for morning runs or picnics. If I ever visit Amsterdam again, this would surely be my top pick for a place to stay! "
29179574,"Thanks Corina for a wonderful stay at your house. Great to be in the best area in Amsterdam x The room was lovely, spacious and quiet, beds were so comfortable and we also really enjoyed the outdoor area.<br/>We had such an memorable time inAmsterdam x"
29189971,"El lugar para 3 personas es bastante chico, el baño no es privado ya que se comparte con la dueña con restriccion de horario para bañarse ( de 9 a 10 y despues de las 23 no se puede usar) . La anfitriona muy amable y nos dejo usar la cocina para hacer tostadas. "
29201021,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Celeste's home. The space was amazing and was a great base for our trip to Amsterdam. Celeste made the place very welcoming and even had a bottle of wine for us on arrival! The huge kitchen diner was perfect for our group to enjoy time at home and out and about. I would recommend this property to anyone looking for a chilled out time in Amsterdam. 
29218982,"I stayed with Toetsie for 4 days after traveling Europe solo for 3 weeks. I cannot tell you how refreshing it was to stay in such a cozy home with such an inviting host. Toetsie was there to help whenever I needed but also left me to my own devices. She gave me advice about the city, the people, help with directions, provided wine and snacks, and even let me take a bike ride ;) Not to mention rokie (the cat) was a cuddle buddy every night. The house was clean, the bed comfortable, and the location was wonderful. Toetsie truly makes the Amsterdam experience; I WILL be back staying with Toetsie and rokie again :)"
29225564,"The room is good and I have a great experience in Amsterdam. Although I waited quite long for the picking up, it was fine and understandable. The host is nice, friendly and the room is nice as well. The host trusted me as family and I also kept the room tidy, being considerate, we were like a family :)<br/>If I went to Amsterdam again, I will surely consider to stay there again. :)<br/>Thanks for the hosting, Marga!! :) What you did help me have less pressure on financial, I really appreciated about it! :)"
29246874,The location is in a very loud and party area of the city. I was woken up by people screaming and loud metallic banging through the night into the early morning. Next time I would prefer to stay in another area of the city. Everything is easily accessible no matter where you stay as Amsterdam isn't too large. The pictures and the actual unit are similar the pictures make the place look brighter and more cheerful. The space is dark and the bed was very very uncomfortable. This unit is managed by a company which is why I'm guessing it felt more like a motel and less like an AirBnB. 
29251481,"Roman was very helpful through out the whole booking process and communication when we arrived in Amsterdam. <br/>He was very attentive when we arrived, showed us around the apartment and left a manual on the table for us. <br/>The apartment was lovely. Spacious. Very clean. Lots of room for us to put our bags (we had 6 bags). The beds were comfortable, can be split into two if needed and we had separate blankets which is always good.<br/>We didn't use much of the kitchen as we weren't there for very long but the appliances were new and clean.<br/>The apartment is right on the canal, and has a lovely view from the living room. The building is also very secure with a key to the main entrance that locks automatically behind you and a second key to the apartment itself.<br/>As we were leaving at 1pm from Amsterdam, Roman allowed us to leave our bags downstairs from 11am (check out time) until we had to leave for the train station.<br/>The apartment is very close to the tram (being the main form of public transport to get around Amsterdam) and only a short walk from many restaurants, cafes, supermarkets, pharmacies. Even the Apple Store is within walking distance.<br/>I would highly recommend this apartment to anyone staying in Amsterdam. Roman was a great host.<br/>"
29280558,"Nichts hätte besser sein können als bei Maike & Caspar. Sie sind wunderbare Gastgeber - zurückhaltend und doch jederzeit hilfsbereit. Mit viel Liebe und Aufmerksamkeit bereiten sie jeden Morgen ein sehr leckeres Frühstück zu. Ihr Haus liegt etwas abseits des bunten Treibens in den sehr schönen Docklands von Amsterdam. Am Morgen schaut man beim Frühstück auf die vorbeiziehenden Schiffe. Es ist ruhig und absolut sicher in dieser Gegend. Und wer sich für Architektur und moderne Stadtentwicklung interessiert, wird das Viertel gar nicht erst verlassen. Wir hatten tolle Tage in Amsterdam, auch dank der wunderbaren Unterkunft und der Gastfreundschaft von Maike und Caspar. Sehr empfehlenswert!"
29298765,"Spacious and clean room, very friendly and hospitable host. Provides great recommendation on food and attractions. Bus stop is close to the house and very convenient to go to Amsterdam Central from there. One of the best Airbnb experience for me. "
29301965,"Might be the best apartment in Amsterdam offered on Airbnb, one of the best places I have stayed in ,the apartment is in the middle of the park with wonderful view , easy to reach very well designed & host cared about little details , it's very clean bed is comfy and only 10 min or less away from tram station .Marloes & Gabriel were very nice and helpful, answered all our questions and gave us great advices about our stay in amsterdam,they reply us fast without hesitation, they offered us bikes and in last night of our stay we were hungry and everywhere was closed at that time and they served us a lovely dinner at such a late time of the night. We will definitely stay at their place again when we visit Amsterdam."
29304993,"Our stay with Toetsie was similar to staying with a long time friend. We were warmly welcomed and well taken care of as well as having a comfortable cosy room to stay in. Her house is perfectly located with quick access to Amsterdam centraal as well as having great eateries and scenery nearby. <br/>We wouldn't stay anywhere else if we visited again and highly recommend anyone in search of a fantastic Amsterdam experience to stay with Toetsie.<br/>Many thanks<br/>Jamie and Tiffany<br/> "
29307839,"Le logement est conforme à la description. Il est très beau. La chambre lumineuse, grande avec une jolie vu sur le jardin ou il est très agréable de passer quelques minutes. Tout est parfait. L'espace qui est réservé à notre accueil est indépendant du reste de la maison, c'est très tranquille. Nos hôtes ont tout fait pour nous mettre à l'aise tout de suite. Il nous ont accueillis très gentiment avec un verre sur la terrasse, très agréable et nous ont donné toutes les explications pour que nous passions un agréable séjour sur Amseterdam et la campagne environnante. (plan, explication écrites.... ) Les vélos qu'il mette à votre disposition sont très utiles aux déplacements et même si la maison n'est pas en plein centre, il est très facile de le rejoindre rapidement par une agréable piste cyclable à proximité de la maison jusqu'au ferry gratuit qui mène au centre et qui est très agréable sur une traversée de  minutes environs et qui s’arrête en plein centre . (gare centrale). Le petit déjeuner est copieux, correct et équilibre, (fruits frais, fromage, pain jambon, confiture....) Marion et Jang sont des hôtes extrêmement prévenant, gentils, tranquille, souriant. Le quartier est calme et beau, la maison au bord d'un petit canal. Marion et Jang parlent très bien le Français."
29308234,"Sono stato per qualche giorno in questa abitazione, l'accoglienza è stata buona, la proprietaria era cortese e gentile con noi. La camera era molto bella con un bel bagno e un giardino delizioso. Tutto ben curato e pulito. "
29308677,"Lovely apartment and host.  We both loved the towel warmer in the washroom - luxurious.  It was also nice to have little essentials in the kitchen such as coffee, tea, sparkling water and orange juice.  It was clear Mike wanted us to have a great time; he was very prompt at responding to our messages both before and during our stay.<br/>Neighbourhood is perfect - walking distance to everything you could want (coffee, restaurants, bars, shops, market) without being overcrowded and touristy.  Overall we really enjoyed ourselves.<br/>A couple of things worth mentioning so there are no surprises (though we didn't mind, others might): the washroom is small and it is a tight squeeze to close the door while also sitting on the toilet (unless you turn sideways).  The washroom is a tiled ""wet room"" with the shower and toilet only.  Sink is in the kitchen.<br/>The apartment is on the second floor of the building up a narrow and steep stairwell; there are sturdy handrails on both sides of the stairs.  We expect this is standard for Amsterdam."
29313368,"Jeroen est un homme gentil, chaleureux, et accueillant. Il m'a donné beaucoup de conseils utiles. La chambre est très bien, bien qu'il soit un peu froid parfois. Il se trouve un peu loin de la centre de Amsterdam, mais  grâce à le bus stop près de sa maison, le bus est convénient."
29328635,Chantal communicated very well before we arrived and in good time. Apartment was well located for museums and restaurants.
29338705,"The description was according to the announcement, and the neighborhood was nice.The flat is close to the tram station (about 5 min walk). She was friendly and her cat is very cute and calm."
29342809,"We had a great time at Mirjam's place! Although we didn't meet her, we had the pleasure to be hosted by her neighbour Desire. The place is as shown in photos, and the location is the best you can ask for!"
29343204,"As I said on the other review (had 2 different books for this place), wonderful place and wonderful hosts.<br/>Everything perfect. Great stay at Maike's and Casper's. The room is super nice and comfortable and they hosted us perfectly (also made us some dinner the night we arrived and had a very kind chat with us!).<br/>Near city centre (10/15 minutes by bus) in a beatiful place of Amsterdam.<br/>Hope seeing them again someday."
29348424,We enjoyed staying with Olaf.  A great location.  Very clean house.  I loved all his comic decorations.   
29380045,"Our host made us feel very welcome through comprehensive explanations prior to our arrival, and having a friend meet us upon arrival and welcome us. He also left us a bottle of wine. The neighborhood was central, green and lovely, with a nice cafe on the corner. We fully enjoyed our stay!"
29422353,Most enjoyable stay with Rosie.Awesome location also!<br/>Matt- Rosie's husband and Rosie were a pleasure to stay with- very helpful+accommodating.Would stay again for sure. <br/>There was a lot of music playing quite loud on several nights on the street- however this on all occasions shut off at 10/11 pm. 
29433345,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Marloes and Gabriel's apartment. The apartment is very new and clean. Although the location is a bit further out from the city, the apartment is quite close to a tram station which you can take to get into the city. Another way to travel into the city centre is to ride a bike. Marloes and Gabriel were kind enough to lend us their personal bikes and locks. <br/>Marloes and Gabriel are fantastic hosts. They picked us up by car from the tram stop and also dropped us off when we were leaving. They are both very friendly and helpful hosts. Marloes was very sweet in giving us some stroopwaffels when we left. <br/>We highly recommend staying here."
29440021,"Thank you Ingo!  We loved our weekend in your beautiful, bright, spacious apartment with its lovely view (and big windows through which to watch the world go by).  It is brilliantly situated on a pretty canal with everything one might want right on the doorstep: cool cafés, nice shops, a very good Italian restaurant next door, and the museums within walking distance.  We really enjoyed exploring the city both on foot and by bicycle.  (The 'Hidden Amsterdam' guided bicycle tour was one of the highlights of our stay.)  We would highly recommend your apartment - it was the perfect place to spend the Bank Holiday weekend. Finally thanks also for accommodating our late check-in and for providing us with a very welcome bottle of Prosecco and cookies on arrival!"
29461841,"Olaf was very friendly and helpful and the neighborhood was very nice and quite close to the center. The only bad thing was the bathroom and shower were downstairs, and the shower wasn't very strong. But the apartment is cozy and welcoming just like the host :)"
29494747,"Karlijn was absolutely lovely, giving us great instructions and a beautiful home to stay in. Good transport links very close by and in a lovely area with no noise. Highly recommended!"
29504648,"El apartamento es una pasada: muy bien situado, muy cómodo, tranquilo, silencioso, limpio, amplio, bien equipado. Lo recomendaría, sin ninguna duda.<br/>No conocimos a Roman, pero nos recibió un amigo muy amable, que nos entregó las llaves."
29557765,"Super apartment, nice neighborhood! Constanze is a great host, she was really helpfull with everything. Will come back!"
29561999,"Enith was a very friendly host, offering all kinds of information, help and snacks. :) The large room was nice, clean and very comfortable, located in a quiet neighbourhood, close to the ""Science Park"", ideal for a short stay at the university.  I recommend this room and host."
29588616,"Nous sommes très content de notre séjour passé chez Jeroen. Il nous a réservé un accueil chaleureux en prenant le temps de nous expliquer les plans très sympas et comment s'orienter dans Amsterdam. C'était notre première fois dans cette ville et ses conseils ont contribué à la bonne expérience que nous en avons eu.<br/>Le studio est original, le lit très confortable et cerise sur le gâteau, nous avons été accueilli par un héron qui semble très familier du lieu.<br/>Nous y reviendrons avec grand plaisir."
29596762,"From the moment we landed and was  greeted by Arjan ,Laura's husband , we felt like family. The house is in a perfect location. walkable to everything but we were able to bike thanks to our hosts.   The breakfast each morning was perfect to start the day.  The accommodations are fantastic, with modern space and comfortable bed. We would highly recommend this to anyone wanting to have a great visit to Amsterdam. We will definitely be back in the future.   Thank you Laura and Arjan for a great beginning to our vacation. We look forward to seeing you soon. "
29596866,Our stay at Olafs couldn't be better. The location of his appartment was in a very safe and upbeat neighberhood. Olaf was very helpful and gave us a lot of information on where to rent bikes and good places to eat. By far the best part of his appartment though was his roof terrace! I definitely recomend this place and i will probably visit again.
29603341,"Enith is a very friendly, very hospitable host. She showed me around in Amsterdam with her car and dropped me off later at the concerthall Melkweg. She had everything prepared( where I had to go): she gave me a map with all the metro stations from the Melkweg to her house and vice versa. She gave me directly something to drink at my arrival and bread and cheese for breakfast in the morning at the departure day. She also gave me a lift form her house to Schiphol (Enith works there) where I proceeded my way home by train. The room was also very nice and clean with a nice roof terrace.<br/><br/>For me it was a very pleasant stay in Amsterdam because  of the warm welcome and support I got from Enith. <br/><br/>Enith is a host I certainly can recommend,both  for the room and for her hospitability and warm welcome I got/you will get."
29670399,"Edwin's suit is definitely in a perfect location, small but cozy. It has everything you need. Although Edwin was out for holiday, he still manage to leave the instruction very clearly and his friend Boni was very friendly as well."
29678653,"Joke is a wonderful host. She welcomes us with a nice coffee and traditional bread. After that she was so kind to explain how to get to all the attractions that we want to. Also, the house is cosy and clean it make us feel so comfortable to stay in. Moreover, the breakfast was different everyday,the same is all the ingredients are health and taste really nice. Furthermore, she really take care of us, she help us to check the bus timetable to the airport it help us to get the flight on time. Finally, before we leave she even bought us some traditional bread and biscuits for us to bring home, and she also made sandwichs for us to eat while waiting for the flight. It is an amazing experience.<br/>Thanks a lot !"
29683573,"I have stayed in many great Airbnb homes, but this one was by far my best experience. The apartment was spacious and neat in the perfect location in Amsterdam; in a calm neighbourhood, but still close to the busy city center. Arjan and Laura were wonderful hosts! They had great activity and restaurant recommendations, and they went the extra mile to make sure it was an amazing stay. I would definitely like to stay here again if ever I return to Amsterdam. "
29728600,"Super hosting Fenno is very kind and help us multiple timed during our stay. He provide us a very useful ""first need"" map of the neighborhood and also gave us some great tips about the city. <br/> We had a great stay. thanks"
29736759,"Though Sarah Jane was traveling and unable to greet us she made sure that her parents were available to let us in and show us the apartment and they were a delightful way to begin our visit to Amsterdam. Very sweet and accommodating. The apartment is small (as European apartments can be) but quite adequate for our needs. It is located on a quiet street not too far from the #10 tram that can take you to the center of town or to the station where you might arrive or depart. We mostly chose to walk and explore the streets and this is a fine place to start out your day. There are plenty of food markets, restaurants and pubs near by. The place is not only clean but quite well put together and attractive.<br/>"
29746163,"Maike and Caspar are the best hosts you can get! Super caring, they invited us to their place for coffee and drinks, they lent us rain jackets and umbrellas and even a sweater, because the weather was unexpectedly cold. The room is perfect, clean, private, very complete, awesome views to the canal, private shower and bathroom, yummy breakfast. The area is very nice and modern and we loved getting to know that part of Amsterdam which you would not normally know if you stay in the center. It's very easy to get there by bus or tram. If you rent bikes, it is also close by. Not exactly walking distance if you've already been walking all day in the city... We highly recommend this place! "
29773638,We really enjoyed Tamara and Kees' home. It is a beautiful home and they made us feel very welcome. Tamara was always very quick to respond to queries. I would definitely stay there the next time I'm in Amsterdam. 
29781174,"Sjoukje was generally a friendly host, but when we arrived we didn't feel very welcome, because we woke her up in the morning, because she forgot when we arrive. She was very confused sometimes and she smoked in the flat, what we didn't know before. We are not very finical in terms of cleanliness, but the bathroom was quite dirty considering the cleaning fee of 15 Euros. <br/>Alltogether it was a really nice trip and the good thing is that the flat is very close to the tram, so you reach the innercity very fast and the bed was really comfortable."
29785891,"Martine was a very kind host, we had nice chats and she even took a splinter out of my foot. We had a great stay in her home, you can reach the metro stop in 10 minutes from the house."
29787639,"Very recommended! Pretty, clean apartement close to the princengracht in the charming and quiet jordaan quater, but still very close to center. The host Sarah is a very friendly person. The check-in and check-out was well organised whithout any problems! Thank you very much, Sarah!"
29794408,"Das Appartement war leider kein Appartement im eigentlichen Sinne,  sondern ein einzelnes Zimmer, abgetrennt durch eine Schiebewand vom restlichen Teil des Hauses, welches wir mit Marijke teilten.  Die Kategorie ""ganze Unterkunft"" traf also nicht zu. <br/>Es roch stark nach Rauch in der Wohnung und das Zimmer war zu klein für drei Personen,  da man sich ja nicht weiter im Haus verbreiten konnte. Die 500 Euro für drei Nächte erschienen uns also als nicht angebracht. <br/>Die Umgebung war nicht schlecht,  von der Nachbarschaft erfuhren wir eigentlich nichts. <br/>"
29815402,Ingo was simply a great host very chilled out and his apartment is perhaps the best spot in Amsterdam. True to the words mentioned earlier. I ratify and affirm all good that has been mentioned in the past and the only difference being that the good was simply excellent this time. Will definitely be back. My second stay at this property and yet my experience was like the very first one. Simply Superb
29963332,"Loved the home and loved the host! The apartment has a wonderful atmosphere; it's welcoming, cozy, and refreshing. We also enjoyed the neighborhood; Sheryl recommended the Thai place across the street and the Dutch restaurant on the corner, both were excellent! The bus stop and tram stop are just steps from their front door. Highly recommend for any size group."
29963343,"Это был  первый опыт Airbnb, когда вместо гостиницы решил забронировать комнату. Просторная и уютная  комната с балконом на крыше - это что-то)),  кофе и закуски приятно удивили.<br/>Дом находится красивом и тихом районе недалеко от центра. Этим и воспользовался, гуляя по солнечному Амстердаму.<br/>Спасибо  Enith за теплый и радушный прием, а также за помощь  в освоении маршрута по городу.<br/> "
29972124,"A really good welcome, a quiet room and a pleasant district.<br/><br/>Thanks you Marion for language teaching!! ha!ha<br/><br/>Marjorie et Arnaud from France (proooost!)"
29977008,"Monique and her family were an amazing host. We celebrated the birthday of my girlfriend in Amsterdam an Flint has painted a cute little picture for her. Everything was brilliant, from the handover of the key to the advices for the city. <br/>The appartment was clean, cozy, well equiped, with a fulled bookshelf, tasty tea and a coffemaker. <br/>The area was secure, with lots of families and a short jump to the public transport. By foot is just a 15 min walk along the Ij to the city center. <br/>I just can thank to Monique, it was a pleasure to stay at her place."
29978044,Marijke was friendly and the room was everything it was advertized to be. I'd recommend the place for business trips.
29979912,"Mieke was very helpful, informative and a pleasure to deal with. The flat is fantastic light airy and modern in a nice area. Quiet both during the day and evening even on a weekend. I would definitely stay again."
30030339,"Nous avons passé un très bon séjour chez Micha. Il nous a beaucoup aidé et l'appartement était très propre, bien équipé!"
30043758,"Das Apartment von Chantal ist perfekt für eine Familie wie wir sie sind: Funktional und doch sehr ansprechend eingerichtet, mit Allem, was nötig ist, um entspannt in den Tag zu gehen und sich nach einem langen Tag in der Stadt zu erholen. Wir haben alle sehr gut geschlafen, konnten die Küche gut nutzen und wunderbar gemeinsam Tisch sitzen und Pläne für den Tag schmieden. Das Apartment ist sehr gut gelegen,  nur wenige Minuten entfernt vom Museumsplein und dem großen Markt. Es ist hell und freundlich!<br/>Chantal hat uns trotz unserer langen Verspätung sehr nett begrüßt und uns alles gezeigt und erklärt. Vielen Dank, ich kann dieses Apartment absolut empfehlen!"
30059777,"Great place, good location, highly recommended!"
30063420,"What a lovely home on a boat! Hanneke was so helpful with suggestions and ideas and the boat is a lot bigger than I was expecting. It is in just a fantastic location , so central but also quiet and tucked away. The markets on the Saturday were a great idea, thank you !! "
30064063,Annneke was wonderful and had a positive energy.  We loved her home! 
30066839,We had a great stay at Barbara's house and immediately we felt like home!! The place is only a walking distance away from the center and Barbara really took great care of us in just putting all necessary information for us together!!! We would love to come back!!! Thank you very much for making our stay in this beautiful city even more fantastic!!! 
30069479,"Definitely the coolest hotel I've ever stayed in or could imagine! The main area, room and bathrooms were extremely clean and well kept. The pictures don't even do the hotel justice! The staff was awesome and very helpful as well."
30082134,"You should choose here because the house is close to tram stop and the Albert Cuypmarkt, if you want to visit the Heiniken Experience, it only takes 10 minutes by walking. Olaf is friendly and he give us many information. You can use the kitchen, computer,  and the washing machine. The room is clear and comfortable. We have three persons and live in here for four days. Everyday is wonderful."
30092352,"Olaf is a great host, very funny and a lovely guy! He even got me a present for my birthday! The neighbourhood was a lovely area, close to the tram stops and loads of shops. The roof terrace has to be one of the best things about this place, we had lovely weather and enjoyed using it. Olaf's place is cool and colourful and makes you feel very welcome. Great place, great host and great location! Thanks for letting us stay :)"
30095626,"Corina's place was perfect for our stay in Amsterdam. It's in a really nice area and very near city center- we were able to walk all over Amsterdam from this location. The room was very comfortable and had a private bathroom and lovely patio. Even without use of the kitchen, our stay was made simple, as we had our own fridge, coffee maker, hot water heater, and yummy wine and chocolates provided by Corina! A great place to stay, with a great host!<br/>(five stars :) )"
30101156,Cool apartment in a nice area. Karen was a great host. The only thing that could have been better is if she had internet at the apartment.
30114540,Jokes Appartement war für mich genau das richtige um Amsterdam gut  kennenzulernen. Es liegt mit dem Rad oder der Tram nur ca 15 min vom Zentrum entfernt. Der Weg zum Flughafen ist auch sehr kurz. Joke ist ein ganz ruhige und liebe Gastgeberin und wir haben uns bei ihr sehr wohl gefühlt . Zudem bereitet sie auch kleine Speisen und das Frühstück sehr liebevoll und schmackhaft zu. Ideal für Bio und Vegetarisch-Liebhaber. 
30121649,"Thank you Joke for your warm welcome in your centrally located flat. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Amsterdam and at your place. Waking up early we were looking forward to your delicious, fresh and rich homemade breakfast. Your tips regarding transportation & visits were very useful and enabled us to fully enjoy our days in Amsterdam. Thank you for making us feel at home in your home!"
30194247,"Hetty went bejond what I would expect from a host: She welcomed my late-arriving colleagues with a soup and there was even wine, snacks and beer in the fridge to use!<br/>All in all a very comfortable experience. The apartment is quite old and has it's specialities, you need to know how to deal with the heating and the door-keys for example. But we felt at home - much more than in a Hotel! Hetty lives close by and responds really quick to all questions or if you need some help.<br/>Last but not least, the place is in walking distance (15min) from RAI. Perfect for us as we attended a trade show there.<br/>Thanks for hosting us, Hetty!<br/>"
30196365,"Anne Marie is a very gentle and nice host. Her flat is clean, very cosy and comfortable with a little backyard. Toilet and kitchen are a little small but very well engineered. Flat is located in wonderful calm place: ferry takes you to the heart of city in 3 minutes. From ferry station to home it takes 3-4 minutes on bicycle or 7-8 on walk. It was very relaxing to come back home after all day tripping. Close to home there are three good restaurants and one big useuful supermarket.<br/>We enjoyed very much our stay here and suggest this flat to all."
30198045,"I had an absolutely fantastic stay at Olaf's place, from the very beginning I experienced the warm house welcoming and friendly host of Olaf.  <br/>The accommodations were cosey and extremely beautiful! The atmosphere was perfect with the artistic and colorful decoration. <br/>The neighborhood was safe and in a great location. <br/> Our trip was extremely better with Olaf's advises."
30200990,"Un bel endroit pour un beau moment de vie, je le recommande sans hésitation, de plus Ingo est un hôte très attentionné, il s'était souvenu que nous buvions bcq de cafe il avait mis à notre disposition différentes capsules, et durant notre séjour nous a tel pour savoir si tout nous convenait. Nous sommes restées 5 jours dans son appartement et nous nous y sommes senties comme chez nous. L'appartement est exactement comme sur les photos ( dommage il y avait des échafaudages car l'immeuble était en ravalement.... Donc la vue était genee), l'appartement est très clair avec bcq de fenetres, ce qui est plaisant car l'immeuble est borde de canaux qui ont énormément de charme, l'emplacement est ideal car a quelques mètres du centre mais sans son agitation. L'appartement est très calme, donc pour dormir c'est parfait !!<br/>Nous y retournerons sans l'ombre d'un doute."
30206736,"My friend and I had a wonderful 2-night stay at Hetty's apartment in Amsterdam. Hetty is great -- she let us check-in early and spent time telling us about Amsterdam over coffee and stroopwafels, and she was always easy to reach and quick to respond. The apartment is in a great location in a quiet part of the city, right by a tram and bus stop and a 15 min walk to the Zuid train station. The 24 hour transportation pass for 7 euro was the way to go. The apartment is homey and has everything you may need, and the twin beds we slept on were really comfortable. We definitely recommend staying here!"
30223077,"Very nice accommodation and neighbourhood. Easy to find, and very comfortable, lovely cats. Thank you "
30228362,"The first word that comes to mind is PERFECT.  Anna is the perfect hostess, the houseboat is in the perfect location, very peaceful and quiet. Anna took such wonderful care in all that she does. The breakfast was overwhelming, in quality and quantity. The fresh homemade apple tart with real whipped cream was extraordinary. From the treats in the bedroom to the cleanliness of the house, Anna seemed to anticipate more than our needs. It was so relaxing eating breakfast while watching the swans and the rowboats sail past on the canal. If a quiet and restful atmosphere is important to you, Anna's is the place. I also felt like more like family than a guest. Also we found a number of excellent restaurants within easy walking distance. And when you are ready to see all that Amsterdam is noted for, the tram is right around the corner. We are already planning our return for next year. "
30231242,"L'appartement est bien situé. Non loin du centre ville en prenant le tram.<br/>Tres tranquille.<br/>Confortable et très propre.<br/>Bonne adresse"
30234026,"Quel séjour formidable!!!!<br/>L'appartement est exceptionnel, ensoleillé, beau, propre et très confortable... Exactement comme sur les photos...<br/>C'est de loin ce que j'ai réservé de mieux sur Aibnb!<br/>Et que dire de Viola et Daniel! Très très gentils et disponibles.<br/>Ils ont rendu mon séjour à Amsterdam inoubliable <br/>Merci encore xxxx Parfait!!!!!"
30238027,"Olaf's place was extremely comfortable and clean. The colors in his apartment are very welcoming and lively. He explained everything about the house, kitchen and made our stay very easy. <br/>We ended up reaching the house earlier than we had planned and Olaf was very helpful with our changed plans. The tea, coffee and waffles he made for us definitely warmed us up on the chilly day. The Ethiopian restaurant right next to his house was an excellent suggestion from him. We would have loved to have a few drinks on the roof and enjoy the view (which was breathtaking) had it not been so cold the night we spent in Amsterdam!<br/>I definitely recommend his place if you are visiting Amsterdam."
30248720,Amazing location. Amazing house. Amazing host to contact if needed. We enjoyed this stay so much that we contemplated cancelling some of our trip to stay longer. Heleen your house is as wonderful as you are. Xxx
30293918,"We had a great experience staying here. Sarah-Jane was very welcoming and stayed up late to wait for us while our Easyjet flight was extremely delayed. The place was clean and looked just like the pictures and was in an amazing location in Amsterdam. <br/>We had an amazing time and would definitely go back! "
30299788,"Toetsie hat mir eine sehr herzliche Ankunft ermöglicht. Die Wegbeschreibung und die Verabredung für die Ankunftszeit waren gut und unproblematisch. Das Zimmer war wie beschrieben und in der Nacht auch sehr ruhig, ich konnte sehr gut schlafen. Das Frühstück war sorgfältig ausgesucht und ""organic""! Der Wohnbereich ist sehr originell eingerichtet und insgesamt ""atmospheric"". Meine Gastgeberin hat mir gute Tipps zum Ausgehen und für die Transfers gegeben. Alles war unkompliziert und die Gegend angenehm, Parks in der Nähe, Joggen/Tram/Metro einfach möglich. Gerne wieder und ein herzliches Danke!"
30330156,"Wow what an amazing stay! The pictures do not do justice to the beautifully appointed accommodation. Far superior to a hotel and Anneke made us feel very welcome with an amazing array of hospitality. <br/><br/>This houseboat is a must for design enthusiasts, and with all mod cons it delivers everything needed with far more charm and character than even the best boutique hotel.<br/><br/>The location is ideal and only a short walk to the vibrant centre of Amsterdam and all the attractions it has to offer, Anneke's houseboat is located in a fairly secluded and quite area to allow a peaceful nights sleep. "
30348082,"I've stayed in Rosie place 2nights for vacation. Must say her place is really located super convenient and the room is just like the picture she posted on here. Even my arrival time is earlier than I contacted her at first, but she still warm welcomed me. Nice talk in breakfast with other guest too. Do recommend Rosie b&b for everyone who decide to visit Amsterdam! "
30378416,"Marga is super nice, she even picked me up from the train station close to her place. The little cottage is in her garden right next to her houseboat on the beautiful Amstel river. Marga rented me a bike and offered to make breakfast. You can bike in about 15 minutes to the centre of amsterdam. Totally recommended if you want a unique place to stay! "
30383597,Perfect living experience and so happy to stay with 2 cute little cats!
30407360,"The place was exactly as on the pictures. Andrea left us some snacks, towels, bathrobes and city maps. There is everything for comfortable staying in the room. The flat is very close to subway. I recomend staying at Andrea's place!"
30424124,"We've just spent 5 days on the Boreas celebrating my 50th birthday and it was perfect in every way! The boat is a lovely old wooden Dutch ship which is full of character - we loved it! <br/>The kitchen is well equipped and the living/kitchen space was great for us to all chill out in after pounding the streets of Amsterdam. The owners did not impose on us at all but were there if we needed help with anything. They were particulary helpful as we needed internet whilst away for work purposes and they made sure this worked well so we had no stress there.<br/>We had 14 of us on the boat and everyone had a great time and agreed that the boat was a big part of that! <br/>We would highly recommend the Boreas for a stay in the beautiful and fun city of Amsterdam - thank you Grietje for making us feel so welcome!"
30498926,Great idea with the small rooms and open communal area. We had a good stay. Relaxing atmosphere with bar attached. <br/>Would stay here again. 
30518275,Room as described and suitable for 2 persons for some days. Hetty's hospitality and character is remarkable and the appartement is well located. Looking forward to be there again.
30534147,"Zeer welkom ontvangen door Toetsie, en er is alles wat je nodig hebt. Mooie etage en een prima kamer. Goed geslapen en ontbijtje was prima. Zeker voor herhaling vatbaar :-)"
30555008,Out stay in Amsterdam was perfect. A stay in a houseboat can be recommended as a different but not luxurious stay. It's clean and cozy and feels right in Holland. 
30556898,"Wonderful place!<br/><br/>Marleen and her dad were incredibly responsive before and during our stay at her charming canal-side flat.  Her dad reached out and waited quite awhile for us at check-in as we became a little lost.   When we arrived, he was very kind and showed us where to find everything (including the bottle of wine Marleen left for us!).<br/><br/>The flat is even better than in the photos and it had everything we needed for a great stay.  It is also very close to everything! <br/><br/>We definitely recommend staying here and would come again!"
30559825,"The place is very well located. I was very nicely received when I arrived.<br/>The room was great, clean and with a bathroom behind.<br/>Many thanks to everything!<br/>The only thing that I disliked, but it's not the host's fault, is that at the street there are many bars and there is too much noise late at night. People drunked and talking loud. But knowing how to deal with it, it's ok. Great place."
30582414,"We had a great time at Jeroen's place!<br/>The room is exactly as shown and described. The bathroom is shared but always clean and tidy and in the 4 nights we were there never once met the other couple we were sharing with, so it actually felt like our own private bath. Bed is super comfy and spacious as well as the room. On the same block you have a shopping mall with supermarket and everything else you might need!<br/><br/>Jeroen is a super-host: knows the city, provided us with a map and gave us precious tips that don't come in guides!<br/><br/>Don't be afraid to stay in the North! <br/>It actually gives you another perspective to amsterdam (a local one) and you'll get to go by ferry to the south side which is a free boat ride (yes, the ferry is free!).<br/>To take the ferry, rent Jeroen's bikes and cycle for just a few minutes until the ferry station.<br/>Still, if you're not the cycling type, just take the 34 bus and in 5 minutes be in the city center. <br/><br/>Definitely recommend it!"
30594715,"Had a more than lovely stay with Joke in Amsterdam! My first time in Amsterdam couldn't have been better. Joke provided us with a kettle for making tea and coffee whenever we wanted. Her apartment is beautiful - modern but has character. The room is beautiful as well. There are three separate beds, nice to have my own bed! And the veranda is right next door where we ate breakfast every morning. Joke treats her guests like they're at a real bed and breakfast. She brings it all out on a tray and presents the food beautifully. It was delicious! She even asked us what we liked and prepared it. There were a lot of options! Felt like a dream to wake up to breakfast on the terrace. The apartment is well located and Joke provided us with tram passes which we paid her back for at the end. She helped a lot with transport planning and restaurant choices. Will definitely stay with Joke again if/when I return to Amsterdam!!!!"
30599466,"Vibeke was very welcoming, she was very nice, sociable and kind. Undoubtedly we are very lucky that we stayed with Vibeke. Photos are true, everything is convenient and clean. It is easily accessible from the airport. The center is 12, 14 tram. Our trip was excellent"
30605228,Hetty was there waiting for our arrive even though our train was late. She is really nice showing us around the neighborhood area. The location of her place is perfect. 1 stop away from the airport. Only takes less than 20 mins to walk from the train station to her apartment. 20 mins walk to the museum area. Multiple trains from the central station to the apartment. Nice and quite place to stay after you walk around the city for whole day. Wifi service is stable. Really good airbnb experience.
30607002,I had a nice stay. It was wonderful to chat over breakfast with Rosie and her husband. 
30637988,"Paul was very helpful before our arrival and flexible in meeting us. The studio is as described and what you would expect for the price in a large city. Excellent location with many good restaurants and even a ""tap house"" right in the neighborhood. Paul provided excellent written notes about the neighborhood and Amsterdam as well as very good maps and other information on our arrival. Paul continued to check in on us via text message after our arrival, but also respectful of our privacy."
30657046,"Hein was kind enough to take some of his time to welcome us and give us detailed information about his best places and visits. Amsterdam by an Amsterdamer, often off the beaten tracks. We loved that ! We also can say that meeting Hein was one of the weird but heartful experiences that can happen when travelling.<br/>As for the little but comfy and practical studio, we enjoyed very much our staying in a place where we felt as in a boat room ;-) A metro station is at the end of the street, the strategic tram line number 10 <br/>runs near and there are nice cafés and a minimarket a few steps away. What else ? ;-) We fondly recommend that guy's place."
30691298,"Le séjour que nous avons passé chez Laura était parfait.<br/>L'accueil est chaleureux, et les hôtes sont très arrangeants sur les conditions d'arrivée et de départ (horaires et dépôt de bagages). <br/>L'appartement est adorable et le petit déjeuner très copieux. <br/>Le logement est à proximité du centre ville, très calme. <br/>Nous avons été très bien guidé par Laura et son mari. <br/>Merci pour tout, <br/>Pauline&Jérôme"
30705847,"Nous avons passé un long weekend fantastique à Amsterdam grâce à l'accueil très chaleureux de Anneke. Nous ne pouvions rêver mieux : situation idéale dans un ""house boat"" très confortable, décoré avec beaucoup de goût, et d'une propreté irréprochable ; petits déjeuners succulents et extrêmement copieux.<br/>De plus, Anneke nous a donné plein de conseils de visites, nous a prêté ses vélos et nous a fait nous sentir comme à la maison.<br/>Nous recommandons vivement cette adresse où nous retournerons certainement bientôt."
30734183,"Easy communication, and made us feel very welcome."
30742070,"We were made to feel most welcomed. We had a delightful three days in Amsterdam, with such a quiet, peaceful and beautiful ""Home"" to come home to each evening.<br/>Excellent central position."
30754650,On arriving at airport at 6.55 pm I received a text asking us to be there at 7.30 as she was going out . So we ended up having to pay for taxi in order to arrive in time. Rosie met us told us she was going out and showed us to room up yet another steep flight of stairs. We were told the strict house rules pay for breakages no cooking etc. although I am 67 years old it felt like I was back at school. We were told breakfast would be served around 9.00 am and she would knock to let us know it was ready. She left and I noticed kettle but no cups etc. I asked her husband for some and he said he would sort but we never got any. Sat in room 1st morning at 9.00 waiting for knock which didnt come till 9.45 greeted by Rosie in her dressing gown. Thought breakfast looked good on website but all we were offered were a couple slices of bread and a coffee. She left straight away to go to doctors. After that we never bothered with breakfast again. My main complaint would be that we understood it was a private bathroom but it was not it was communal and with a toilet that sounded like a jet engine going off. Just one towel each no hand towels I could go on but my wife and I did love Amsterdam and found some lovely places to eat but I think we will be going back to staying at hotels on our visits abroad as we think they are much better value for money.
30763297,"Hetty was a wonderful host, thank you so much for everything !! <br/><br/>We easily get in touch and she gave us (me and my friend) awesome tips for the week-end.<br/><br/>Beds were very comfortable, very quiet place, the restaurant Fidelio is great. Hema & Marqt (organic store) just in front and beside the apartment.<br/><br/>We will definitely choose this place again.<br/><br/>Anne-Laure & Lisa"
30767408,"Olaf was very helpful with his communications before we arrived,<br/>and welcomed us with warm Stroopwafels. The apartment was as described and the downstairs has a very impressive collection of comics art and memorabilia. Everything was fine and Olaf was very friendly! Also, it is a very convenient neighbourhood to stay in."
30781183,"Excellent séjour dans l'annexe de la péniche de Marga.  J'ai été accueillie de manière très chaleureuse. C'est un petit coin de paradis dans Amsterdam ! Tous les matins j'ai pu me baigner dans le Amstel,  c'était génial.  C'est un endroit atypique dans Amsterdam que je conseille et reconseille !!"
30784682,"Je suis tout a fait satisfait de l'acceuil et du logement, juste au bord de la riviere!<br/>Marga est vraiment sympathique et amicale.<br/>Je garde un bon souvenir de mon passage !"
30787391,"We stayed with a group of 6 friends for 2 nights at the apartment. It was our first experience with Airbnb and although we had to get used to the idea to stay in someones house with their personal belongings we soon got over that. We fell in love with their pet rabbit Hop!<br/><br/>Femke, Jacko and Lieve (their daughter) were all very helpful and welcoming. I got lots of info beforehand on transport and eating out tips. The 'stroopwafels' were a nice touch when we arrived.<br/><br/>The house was comfortable, spacious and clean and plenty of bedspace for our group. The stairs were steep but that is not something you are likely to get away from in Amsterdam. The tram/bus connection was convenient and the location was good with a lovely view over the canal. Bike hire was just around the corner too.<br/><br/>The only minor point for me personally was the fact we had to be sensitive to the neighbours (baby next door) which was a bit of a task for a group of 6 'giggling' girls. It's not an unreasonable consideration of course and we were pre-warned beforehand.<br/><br/>Overall I would defenitely recommend to friends and return again in the future."
30788265,"Though we didn't get to meet joroen, his girlfriend Noorje was quite helpful and pointed out a few great spots in Amsterdam to us. Our stay in their house was fairly comfortable."
30792708,"We had a lovely two-day stay at Luchiena and Philip's  house. I was particularly impressed with the lovely breakfast provided both days in the beautiful living room upstairs. <br/>We were very comfortable in our beds and the location was outstanding. I would definitely come back here, I imagine it would be lovely in sunnier weather when you could sit out on the bench at the front overlooking the Amstel river. "
30802537,"Wendy was the perfect host! She was so lovely and gave us lots of useful tips for exploring Amsterdam and a bottle of wine when we arrived. The apartment is close to lots of nice cafes and bars, and the whole area has a great local feel. It was clean and well furnished with a great kitcken if you want to cook! I highly recommend hiring bikes as this is by far the easiest way to get around. Would absolutely stay here again!"
30837533,"Arjan and his girlfriend are warm and welcoming, they tried their best to make us feel at home, unfortunately for us the space did not work out great because we felt slightly uncomfortable having to coordinate our schedules to shower with the hosts (as the only shower is located in their room). Dog barking and dog hairs were an issue. The space is the conservatory of the apartment which has been fitted out with two sofa beds, and neither myself nor the people I was staying with felt that we got good value for money as you were squashing 3 adults into one very small room. The room is advertised as private, but you do not have private/separate access, in fact the 'wall' that separates the space from the host's bedroom is just a window, and as the hosts were there for the duration of our stay, this is something that made myself and my two female companions feel a little uncomfortable. The location is very nice, near to loads of bars and cafes, well serviced by public transport."
30850162,"Nous avons été très bien accueilli dans le joli et agréable appartement de Mieke. Le quartier est un peu excentré du Dam mais tout de même très agréable. Un tram est juste à côté, mais nous avons tout fait à pied (sauf un soir). <br/>Mieke nous a très bien reçu et accueilli. Si nous revenons sur Amsterdam, nous n'hésiterons pas à revenir chez elle.  "
30923384,"Das Häuschen ist nett und steht in einer ebensolchen Gegend, man kann zu Fuß gut in die City laufen, ist aber auch schnell an den Haltestellen. Wir haben es als sehr störend empfunden, dass wir unser Zimmer nicht abschließen konnten, das Badezimmer keine Tür hatte und die Gastgeberin morgens die Zeit vorgab, wann man dies benutzen könnte, um nicht mit ihr in die Quere zu kommen."
30933768,"We really enjoyed this very spacious apartment with a great view of the river.<br/><br/>It's a very quiet neighborhood with a short walk to the tram.  It had a well stocked kitchen with an espresso machine.  <br/><br/>FYI to those who value privacy: The upstairs bathroom is part of the bedroom and does not have a door, so if you use that bathroom and your partner is sleeping, you will wake them up.<br/><br/>We've stayed in a few AirBnBs in Europe, and this was the first that had a dryer. We really liked having a dryer. "
30949339,"Alloggio carinissimo ed in una buona posizione. Ifigenia è stata un'amore. Carinissima, cortese e simpatica. Si è messa a disposizione per qualsiasi richiesta o informazione, con una cortesia e una disponibilità meravigliosa. Alloggio molto bello, colorato ed essenziale. L'ingresso con scala è in comune ma l'appartamento è privato e composto da camera e bagno.   Erano compresi anche asciugamani, pantofole, caffè e tè, biscotti, caramelle, netflix.. insomma CONSIGLIATO. <br/>Ottimo per raggiungere il centro a piedi. Dista 20 minuti a piedi da qualsiasi luogo principale di amsterdam."
30963411,"Tivemos dias bastante prazerosos no apartamento de Femke em Amsterdã. O apartamento é espaçoso e muito bem decorado e equipado. Apesar de um pouco distante do centro, a locomoção por tram é muito prática e o ponto é bem próximo ao apartamento. Fica de frente para o parque Rembrant, que aproveitamos pouco por causa da chuva.<br/>Como Femke estava viajando, Caron nos recebeu e foi bastante atenciosa. <br/>As crianças adoraram o Hop. Tivemos uma ótima experiência."
30988013,"Friendly apartment with lots of space and cool interiour. Also the location is perfect to explore the city by foot. Around the flat there are a lot of cafés, pubs, and shops. Pictures & description are very accurate. Thanks for the nice stay Mark!"
30996985,Really nice experience I enjoyed staying here 
31017665,"Perfect in every way. When I asked my Aunt what we should say about the apartment she said ""when are we going back?"" and that just sums up how spot on the lovely apartment was. The apartment was extremely clean, comfortable and well equipped .The location could not be better, great local bars, restaurants and convenience stores. Easy access to public transport and a lovely walk through Vondelpark to the Museums. Thank you Karen and Catherine for all you hints on making it a superb break - and yes we will be back! "
31022624,"Nous avons passé un très agréable séjour à Amsterdam. L'appartement de Jeroen est situé dans la banlieue mais à seulement 10 min de bus du centre-ville. La chambre est spacieuse et propre, et elle dispose d'un grand lit et d'un flipper! Jeroen nous a chaleureusement accueilli, indiqué les lieux à visiter et s'est soucié du bon déroulement de notre séjour. Il parle très bien anglais et un peu français. "
31050448,Rosie is a great host! She has so much experience in traveling and can give you helpful tips on what to see and where to go. Very fascinating woman! The apartment is not as centralized as I would have hoped but the transportation system is reasonably easy and cheap. The city is flat so very walkable. 100% definitely recommend!
31051651,"Even before I reached, I had all the details: which tram to take? where to get down? How to reach? All very well explained.<br/>I reached pretty early in the morning. In spite of that, every arrangement was in place, including maps, guide book....Very thoughtful.<br/>The stay was very comfortable. The tram and the bus stops are nearby which makes life very convenient. <br/>The place is very cosy, with lot of books and art objects. Enjoyed a lot. Thanks Toetsi.<br/>"
31053752,"This is the apartment which have been possessed to an impolite, arrogant host. Lack of communication with us. I will never been there anytime due to the baddest experience which I have never been experience before. In my case, I remembered that every time I sent massages to him, he expressed inpatient attitude and just provide one or two wards to reply us. The room is small with low quality. When I arrived at his home, I negotiated with him that we want to plus one people and we will pay the extra money for this situation. Probably this is our mistake that we did not notice to him in advance. However, he rudely said ""why?"" and impatiently implicated that we can leave and complain to him! We eventually left this terrible place with very upset mind, and in that moment the rain was extremely heavy.   Moreover, we had to find another flat in the heavy rain situation...... All in all, may be this is a cheap flat, however the service is also cheap!"
31054630,"Right in the heart on Amsterdam. Ideal location. Lovely people, making us feel so welcome and really informative "

Je l'ai d'ailleurs déjà recommander dans ma famille."
31104667,"Nathalie e Sarah, foram super atenciosas o tempo todo. A casa é muito aconchegante e confortável. O Bairro é fantástico! perto te tudo e com muita acessibilidade. Realmente indico para todos. O Único detalhe que para nos não foi um problema são as escadas. E mesmo assim apenas na chegada e saída que estamos com as malas.  Para nos esse foi um detalhe insignificante. Com certeza voltaremos uma próxima vez.  Obrigado a Sarah e Nathalie por tudo."
31116274,"Room was just like the pictures. The neighborhood was wonderful.  The interaction with our hosts was just right for us and all my questions were answered.  We only stayed a few days but found things quite to our liking.  The room is compact, but we didn't come there to stay inside!"
31169466,"Wendie and Hans were terrific hosts. Their place was just as presented and very comfortable and private! In addition, they were happy to recommend area restaurants and places of interest. I would definitely return to stay here and recommend their place to anyone. Thank you!"

31224147,"We had a great stay at Jeroen's! Jeroen was an excellent host. He met us at the door and gave us advice and lots of recommendations. The room is very spacious and has good security - there are locks on the front door, an inner door and the door of the room. The supermarket and the bus stop are one minute's walk away, with the no. 34 bus going to/from Amsterdam Central in 10-12 minutes. Would definitely stay here again."
31283494,Tout était tel que décrit...petit cadeau de bienvenu avec beaucoup de détails sur le fonctionnement de la maison et sur ce qu'il y avait à faire et à visiter aux alentours.  Tout simplement parfait!
31297382,"We hebben ons uitstekend vermaakt in Amsterdam in het kleine huis in de tuin. Het voldeed aan al onze verwachtingen. En de locatie was verbazend groen zo dicht in het centrum van de stad. Een echt rustpunt na de drukte in het centrum. Nancy en haar gezin zijn ook ontzettend gastvrij, je voelt je meteen op je gemak. En wil je iets weten dan helpen ze je graag. Wij waren er nu voor de 2e keer en hebben weer een heerlijk weekend gehad met 4 vriendinnen!"
31352139,Heerlijke locatie en super leuk tuinhuisje. Marga is heel vriendelijk en gastvrij. We hebben genoten.
31352712,"The apartment was very nice and beautifully decorated. Extremely clean and organized. Vera and her husband were very easy to get in touch with, as there is a door that leads directly to her own home. Simply knocking brought Vera down with assistance. Only a tad out of the way of the most exciting portions of the city (not a knock against Vera), but otherwise a great experience. "
31353710,"We had a great weekend in Amsterdam.<br/>A very warm welcome from Femke and her daughter.<br/>It´s a beautiful house, perfect for a family stay.

31402044,"We stayed 2 days in Raul studio in July 2015.<br/>The location is awesome and the studio is nice. But there are three problems:<br/>1  The communication with Raul was BAD. We sent a mail 2 weeks before telling him that we would arrive at 10AM, drop the luggages and visit the city till 19PM, asking for details to meet him. No response. After 10 days I asked for a reply. Raul then wrote that he had already sent us all the details, which was not true as it can be seen by AirBnB list of messages. So we arrived at 10AM and found 2 doors and 4 ring buttons, but no Raul. We ringed all the bells and finally an old woman opened her door. She didn’t speak a word of English, but she let us drop our luggages in her living room.<br/>Back at 19PM, door closed and no Raul. The woman saw us waiting and opened the door of the studio…Raul should really read the mails of his customers and make rapid replies :(<br/>As Raul was not there, we ignored he had two bicycles to lend and we had to rent our own :(<br/>2  Inaccurate description: The studio is underground, a sort of cave without window, with just a very small window of 60x40cm obstructed by wooden blind. you have to rely on electric light all the time :(   This fact doesn’t appear in the description of the studio as it should! The price was high, 134 euros a night + 26 taxes, by far the most expensive we ever experimented with AirBnB and we think that for this price you don’t expect a room without daylight.<br/>3  Not enough attention to details :  The shower is Indian style, no shower tray, no shower curtain. Water splashes all around and the water evacuation in the floor  was almost obstructed so that you had 1cm of water all over. The electric light in front of the bath room was out of service…<br/>We will not go back to this place :("
31433867,"unfortunately I was unable to stay due to a family illness, and had to leave Amsterdam sooner than anticipated. Toetsie was understanding and helped with getting some kind of refund back. She checked in with me periodically to find out about the family illness. I am sure this would have been a delightful place to stay, if I am in Amsterdam again, I will definitely stay with her. "
31442268,"A wonderful place in the heart of the city! Marijn was very responsive to every question we had, before and during our stay. <br/>We had a great time! We stayed for 1 week at Corina's place.<br/>It is on the best location within 15 min from anywhere in the center of Amsterdam.<br/>Corina was very nice and even recommended some nice places :) <br/>The room was comfortable and clean with a lovely small garden. <br/>We definitely recommend Joanneke was very welcoming and super responsive. We had a wonderful time at her place and it was just what we were looking for. The place is in a great location, and was also perfect for small breaks in the middle of the day, as we were traveling with a toddler."
31452822,"Marga was a wonderful host, very welcoming and helpful, she came to pick us up from the airport late at night, and drop us at the Rai station when we left the house, the guest room was cosy, clean and very comfortable, and the breakfast was delicious, we really enjoyed our stay there. Definitely recommend it.  "
31467161,"We spent one week in this superb spacious house. It is perfectly furnished and has all of the amenities of home and moreover. The location is great, just 10 minutes by tram to the center, a walk to sport area, children playground, one tram stop to Albert Heijn supermarket, close to Amstel and Science Park train stations.<br/>Our hosts Inger and family put a great amount of effort into making the house extremely comfortable- it is a typical Amsterdam brownstone, just outside the hustle and bustle and in a beautiful residential street that gives you a glimpse into real Dutch Amsterdam life. The spacious kitchen leads into a large living room with fireplace and long wooden dining table which is nice to eat and make a day trips plans. Piano, guitar and sound system create an artistic atmosphere. Glass wall leads to green floral terrace with exit to a canal, armchairs, bench and sofa, table,  barbecue and a small boat. Our hosts kindly provided us with the bikes, wrote us a touching message at the entrance and left fresh tulips.<br/>I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for something comfortable and genuine in Amsterdam, especially for the families with children ! When we will return to Amsterdam, we will definitely stay here again!"
31497295,"I really enjoyed staying at margas,the garden hut was extremely cosy even in the cold weather,I loved the log burner and it kept the place nice and warm,it's a nice 20 minute bike ride into town. Perfect place to stay if you want to avoid the busyness and loudness of staying in the town  "

31525437,"We LOVED staying here in De Pijp! It is an incredible neighborhood and especially convienent to the Rijks, Van Gogh, and Stedelijk museums. The Albert Cuyp Market is literally around the corner and the Sarphatipark is righ across the street! A great area to explore, walk, and find a yummy bite to eat.<br/>The apartment had everything we needed and was just like the pictures. It is cozy, light and airy, and nicely appointed. The kitchen is a perfect size (with dishwasher!) and the bed is super comfortable! We appreciated the black-out curtains for sleeping in, too. We enjoyed the view outside the windows, the cleanliness of the apartment, and chatting with Mike! He is a super nice and fun person to talk to and was very helpful when we couldn't quite figure out the washing machine!<br/>We loved everything about our stay and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a spot in De Pijp. <br/>Thank you! :) We love staying here! The location is perfection & the coziness of the apartment is just right for the two of us! Wouldn’t stay anywhere else ❤️ Extra awesome was a late check out! Thank you, Mike!"
31532499,"Jeroen was a great host! He told us all the cool places to go in Amsterdam Noord, and some really great places in the center. We got to rent his bikes, too, which made us feel like real Hollanders! An awesome city, and a great time!"
31588149,"Our stay was great. The location is very easy to reach when coming by public transportation from the airport. The house was very, very clean and neat and our room was big, comfortable and well equipped. Petra sent us very prompt mails and whatsapps with information and tips about the town and about any of our other questions, before our arrival. She is a fluent english speaker and had friendly conversation with her. Every morning she prepared us tasty breakfast, served in our room.<br/>One of the nicest & biggest park in town is just few minutes from the house. Few restaurants and pubs can be found few steps away. The tram station is also very close. In one word: perfect stay at this location."
31588717,"Job was a wonderful host and has clearly put a great deal of effort into making his flat a unique and comfortable place to stay in Amsterdam. The details - the decoration, the bath tub, the lighting - scored big points with us. The location was ideal - an interesting, vibrant neighborhood with easy access to the rest of the city. The basic amenities were all there and everything appeared exactly as it did in photos. We look forward to our next stay. "

31624842,"Arie was incredibly welcoming and helpful, and everything was just as described (if not better)! We had the most wonderful time on the houseboat, which is on a lovely quiet street that is close to all the action, and it was such a treat to come home after a long day of walking to such a beautiful place. If there wasn't so much to do in Amsterdam, I could have happily spent hours just relaxing on this boat! There are huge windows by the kitchen table that you can open to wave to the passing tourist boats and welcome the birds (coots, swans, and ducks came to say hello). Comfortable bed, hot shower, and coffee included! Overall, an absolutely wonderful stay. We didn't want to leave!!"
31635282,"Super séjour à Amsterdam. L'appartement est joliment décoré, propre et avec tout le nécessaire pour y séjourner plusieurs nuits. Le quartier est superbe. Un séjour qu'on ne peut oublier ! Merci à Mike pour sa réactivité !"
31636327,"Anne-Marie gave us a warm welcome and we feel like we are visiting our friends. She even prepared a quick guide on how to go about the house and Amsterdam. The living room is spacy and my two sons enjoyed playing there. It is quiet neighbourhood and going back home after all action day with the ferry and 7 minutes walk feels like going back home after work. Thanks for the cot bed she provided for my son, we had enough bed space and good sleep. The back garden could have been useful in the summer time. "
31688275,Marleen est une hôte exceptionnelle. Appartement impeccable et très bien situé. 
31714905,"This is a lovely apartment - bright and airy, well furnished and with all the comforts and conveniences you could need.  It's in a pretty residential area, with plenty nice little bars and restaurants around, which means you can escape the tourist rammy in the town centre and soak up some of the real Amsterdam. But it's only 15 mins walk from the museums and into the heart of the city, so very convenient. <br/><br/>Karen could not have been more helpful and flexible and, with the help of her friend Catherine who was our contact in Amsterdam, provided all sorts of useful recommendations and tips.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend it."
31716394,"Wij zijn vriendelijk en gastvrij ontvangen. De ruime kamer was smaakvol ingericht, schoon en van alle gemakken voorzien. Het ontbijt was heel uitgebreid. Wij zijn niets tekort gekomen en kijken uit naar ons volgend bezoek."
31727711,My stay at Marga's place was wonderful. She was kind enough to pick me from the train station and her husband despite being busy himself offered to drop me to the tram station on check out. The home is a little away from the nearest tram stop. But you can rent bikes from Marga. She explained how to get about to the centre from their home and was very kind. The room was clean and comfortable as well.   I definitely suggest staying here.
31767964,"Wow. What an amazing stay. This is a beautiful apartment with all the amenities that you need for a great stay in Amsterdam. The apartment is clean, stocked with toiletries and even fresh ground coffee! It was the perfect base to explore this amazing city. <br/>It is located close to the museums in an absolutely beautiful and quiet neighborhood right outside the Voldepark. <br/>Jan was a wonderful host who was able to accommodate any question I had.

31790509,"Bij Matthijs en francina zit je echt op een top lokatie! Heel centraal met alles wat je wilt ervaren op loop afstand! Wij hebben geslapen in de Hollandse kamer, een klein maar fijn kamertje in de Hollandse sferen met een prima bed en elke dag verse handdoeken. De badkamer deel je met de andere kamer, deze rook heerlijk fris bij aankomst en van het gezamenlijk delen hebben wij geen hinder ervaren! Het ontbijt word verzorgd door een extern bedrijfje (weet even niet meer de precieze naam) dit is al een hele ervaring opzich een leuk klein tentje waar de heerlijke geuren van verse producten je tegemoet komen! Top geregeld dus! <br/>Ohja niet te vergeten dat Matthijs ons zeer enthousiast welkom heeft geheten en elk moment wanneer nodig voor je klaar staat! <br/>Helaas hebben wij geen massage ervaren maar ook hier voor is de mogelijkheid!<br/>Ik zeg zeker een keertje hier gaan verblijven als je harte Amsterdam wilt beleven!<br/>Groetjes Adriaan en Marian "

31842613,We were welcomed by Stephanie who showed us everything we needed to know! The unit is in a quieter neighborhood which is a nice place to retire after spending time in the craziness.

31919430,"Malou was really the perfect host. She welcomed us with a bottle of wine and had prepared informations about the surroundings of the appartment as well as informing us about what was happening in town at the time of our visit.<br/>The appartment is more than great as well. It is beautifully decored, has a pretty confortable bed, a fully equipped kitchen and a very nice garden and all that for a very affordable price compared to general prices of Amsterdam Remco made us a little tour of the appartment and gave us useful informations before leaving us his nice and clean appartment for the day.<br/>He was very friendly and fast to reply during all our contacts and the appartment has all you can wish for. "
31934810,"Wonderful stay on a houseboat in central Amsterdam! Arie was a good host, very keen to welcome us. The boat is spacious, comfortable and, for those who get sea-sick, very stable despite frequent canal boats passing alongside. Location is excellent, in a quiet canal east of central and ten minutes' walk from Damrak (through the red light district). Would definitely stay here again when in Amsterdam."
31975501,"Gerard's apartment exceeded our expectations in every way.  My girlfriend and I were greeted upon arrival and had no issues with check in.  The location was quiet at night, yet very close to all the action in every corner of the Amsterdam.  The Nespresso was an added bonus that we certainly took advantage of.  I would highly recommend this listing to other traveling couples."

It is at a great location and amazing neighbourhood. Restaurants and tram stations are within 5min walking. Museums are also within 15min walk. Olaf is a very good and thoughtful host. He explained everything to us thoroughly and patiently. Communication was a problem at all. We really recommend his flat and him as a host!
32021653,We only stayed 5 days at jereons  although we felt right at home from the start. Jereon is a great host who is more than helpful to point you to all the great spots in Amsterdam.  It's only a 10min  bus ride to central amsrerdam  too. Would recommend this place to anyone looking for a place close to town with their own private room and free helpful hints from the host thankyou for a great stay

32113492,Carolien was easily contactable during and before the stay and provided handy tips before arrival which is always beneficial and appreciated. 
32132674,"Toetsie made my stay in Amsterdam simply wonderful. Although it was a short 1 night stay, I never felt more at home and welcomed at a foreign land, especially this is my first time there.<br/><br/>She is one of the best hosts I have come across, everything is well taken care of, bed and room was clean and the kitchenette has everything you need to whip out a 5 star breakfast in the morning. <br/><br/>Location couldn't be any better. Away from the noise of main town, yet easily accessible by Metro and Trams. You shouldn't need to walk very far with your luggage once you get off from the Metro station. And it is not difficult to find the place. Streets signs are visible at every corners.<br/><br/>I am going to bring my family to Amsterdam and will definitely stay in Toetsie's apartment if it is available.<br/><br/>I would imagine such great place in Amsterdam will be popular and top of the list in the Airbnb Amsterdam.<br/><br/>5 Stars Airbnb Apartment!"
32133614,"Heleen's apartment at De Pijp neighborhood of Amsterdam is large, well lit and airy, beautifully decorated, and socked with all the amenities that made our stay perfect.<br/>The place has 2 bedroom with queen-size beds and a nice sleeper-sofa in the living room. A modern kitchen, a large dinning table and 2 small balconies (one overlooking the Amstel River), a clean bathroom with tub, shower and washer/drier and a separated toilet.<br/>It is located within a short walking from tram and bus line that reach all the major attractions in Amsterdam within 20 minutes. Or you can walk to Rembrandtplain and the Flower market in 20 minutes and to Dam square or the Rijksmuseum in 30.<br/>There are many nice restaurants and coffee shops in the area and plenty of stores and supermarkets around. The neighborhood feels very safe, with children playing on the street and in the nearby park. <br/>Heleen is a grate host. She is patient, easy to communicate with and fun to have a conversation with. She helped us with all our needs constantly throughout the visit and made sure we feel VERY welcomed and at home.<br/>This place was a hidden treasure for us in the heart of Amsterdam."
32150484,Marleen was very fast at responding to any emails. Her father was at the apartment to greet us when we arrived and showed us around. We had a wonderful stay and would definitely come back. The only accident we had was the one of Marleen pictures fell of the wall and the frame smashed...Sorry Marleen! It was a freak accident
32223166,"Olaf was great! Very friendly and as interactive as you choose to be. We had very very comfortable beds and a great great stay. Great, great area as well. Very safe and close to the city. It was the perfect location and stay for us. "

32276759,"Unser Trip nach Amsterdam war super. Dank Gerard und Joke hatten wir einen echt schönen Aufenthalt! Das Hausboot ist sehr modern eingerichtet und bietet alles, was man braucht. Die beiden haben uns ein nettes Frühstück gemacht und haben auch sonst dafür gesorgt, das wir uns sehr wohl fühlen. Sie haben uns super Tipps für Restaurants und Aktivitäten in Amsterdam gegeben. <br/>Gerard hat mit uns eine Bootstour durch die Grachten von Amsterdam gemacht, wodurch wir Ecken kennengelernt haben, die man sonst nicht gesehen hätte.  <br/>Es hat also alles gestimmt - die superschöne, ausergewöhnliche Unterkunft, sehr freundliche Gastgeber und eine sehr lebendige Stadt! Sehr zu empfehlen! Wir kommen gerne wieder! "
32289698,The place is nice and quiet just in the heart of the city. However we were a bit disappointed about the kitchen because there was only a microwave. The place was clean and Marijn was here to greet us and available for any questions. 
32294870,"My friend and I booked the canal view spot months ahead expecting it to be just as amazing as the reviews and description. IT WAS WAY BETTER THAN EXPECTED! <br/><br/>David made sure he checked in with us earlier prior to getting there and left a thorough and easy direction to follow to find our place (about a 5-10 min walk from Central station) . You cant beat this location. Its central and a short walk to everything including fantastic restaurants. The room is so beautiful, quite, safe as well as clean and that view though! Waking up with the canal view reminded us we were definitely in Amsterdam. This place added to the charm of the city and I would book this same spot in a heart beat. <br/><br/>"
32333085,Very great journey in this flat! Near subway! Great quarter! Josy is a very great person! Enjoy Amsterdam!

32391841,"I am sorry to say this is the worst experience I ever had with Airbnb. The unit was basically not in the condition for living in. The owner had painted the walls inside the bedrooms only 1-2 days before. As a result, we couldn't  sleep in the bedroom and needed to live in the living room instead. The smell of the paint was very strong and could be hazard to breath in. The owner was aware that the smell won't be gone by the time we checked in; however, they didn't let us know in advance and didn't look for other units. They mentioned all the alternatives were booked.<br/>Moreover, we saw a mice running from the kitchen to the living room. The response that we got from Lin was ""I am sorry. That was the problem of City of Amsterdam"" .... I have no further comments since I got this type of reply.<br/>After talking with Lin, she decided to credit us one night with the cleaning fee. However, if I compare with several hotels nearby, I should had booked the rooms in one of these hotels instead. At least I will get a clean room with my new bed sheet everyday as well as I don't need to be careful of what I would breath in everyday which could be very dangerous to our health. "
32399571,"We had a lovely time!<br/>Heleen was a great host - she was very welcoming, showed us around the apartment and gave us valuable insider tipps for our stay in Amsterdam.  Thanks again for the welcoming presents: cheese, fresh strawberries and the apple juice! Yummie!<br/>The flat is in good shape and perfect for up to 4 people. The two seperated bedrooms and the big living room with kitchen, as well as two small balconies makes the place very spacious. <br/>The apartment is located right next to the Amstel river with public transport, grocery shops, bike rentals, restaurants, parks right around the corner. After a long day in the touristy city center, it was the perfect place to experience the (for us) typical Amsterdam lifestyle in De Pijp.<br/>Furthermore it is a very good headquarter to explore the city. We bought tram tickets and it was very easy to get around from Heleen's apartment.<br/>All in all a very nice experience - we all, me and my girlfriens (25-30) as well as my parents (60+) had a great time!!<br/>Thanks again for all your convenience and for making us feel at home in Amsterdam. I hope we did not leave too big of a mess ;)<br/><br/>Viele Grüße!<br/>Phil"
32417132,"Emer is very welcoming. The house is really bright and cozy. We were 5 persons and it fit easily, the house is much prettier in reality than in pictures.<br/>Also the house is near to the center, it takes 20-30 minutes from the house to the Center, and with bikes only a few minutes. The neighborhood is very calm and pretty, there is a beautiful park at 500m and the neighboors are really really kind. <br/>That was a fantastic experience, thank you again Emer."
32421117,"Absolutely incredible airbnb. The room was better than the pictures could have shown. The location is just outside the main area so is quiet and has some fantastic things near it including a micro brewery not far away, a beautiful view of the bridge and river and a supermarket. The breakfast provided was better than some hotels, fresh fruit, yogurt and breads, absolutely amazing. Maike and Casper were very friendly and great to chat to and can't wait to visit again."
32533243,"Marga and her husband Rico are very nice and welcoming. She really cared about our staying. She picked us at the RIA station, she told us what we needed to know about Amsterdam and cooked a nice breakfast for a small extra fee."
32557767,"Rosie was a very good host and gave us lots of very good information. Her apt. was as listed, with lots of stairs, however was worth it when you reached your room. We did not meet her husband during her visit, but he sounds like a very interesting man. We would recommend Rosie to those in Amsterdam!"
32579749,"Toetsie is a great host, she is nice and always available for support! From Casa Vrolik is easy to reach the city center, with buses (stops are so near) or Metro. The apartment and the toilet were clean. She also gave us a delicious apple and mango juice and some bread, as a welcome! "
32604146,"Anne-Marie is a wonderful host. The apartment is very cozy and for those who love to smoke, sitting outside is amazing! It is outside the busy city center which is nice but still within walking distance. Would definitely recommend to stay there if you are in amsterdam for more than just a couple of days!"
32647715,"The location of this accommodation is awesome, and with the canals, restaurants and red light district literally at your door step, the atmosphere is buzzing. It is within easy walking distance to central train station, very clean and well equipped. It is just like the photos, and David the host was very accommodating and helpful, but not at all intrusive. I really enjoyed staying here, and would do so again. If you like to be in the centre of things, I would highly recommend this place. We also had the back room which provided us with a quiet nights sleep. Thank you David."
32648740,"I couldn't thank Bram enough for allowing us to stay in his apartment. The place looks far bigger in person. Although Bram was away we were greeted by Jessica who was fantastic and offered to help if we needed anything throughout the stay. The rooftop terrace was great for relaxing and something I will look for in future stays. The place had all the amenities for cooking, was 500 Metres from a supermarket and only 5 tram stops from town. Highly Recommend and would love to come back.  Thanks again."
32665213,"Marga was fantastic, very welcoming, generous and friendly.  The property was exactly as described and very comfortable.  I was very happy to stay here!"
32681060,"Excelent place to stay! Very clean, Toetsie was an amazing host"
32718198,"Wendie and Hans were great hosts and the location of the room is in such a central location, walking distance to everything. Wendie and Hans were easily reached if required with advice and tips. The room had extras  surprises that added to the experience. Hans was lovely enough to help bring our luggage down the stairs. Would recommend this room to anyone visiting Amsterdam :)"

32780797,"Wir wurden von Bob's Eltern herzlich empfangen und später auch von Eve. Die Unterkunft ist genau wie beschrieben und bebildert. Der Kühlschrank war mit kleinen Aufmerksamkeiten gefüllt wie Bier, Wein etc.<br/>Die Eltern haben uns in Vertretung von Eve alles gezeigt und erklärt. Die Unterkunft hat eine eigene gerade verlaufende Gangway die direkt auf den Aussensitzplatz führt, der in natura etwas größer ist als es auf den Bildern wirkt, eine steile Treppe führt nach unten in den Raum. Man hat viel Privatsphäre, ein sehr bequemes Bett, schön wäre noch eine kleine Kommode um nicht aus dem Koffer leben zu müssen. Auf dem Sonnendeck, das ganztägig sonnig ist, haben wir uns gerne aufgehalten auch abends um die vorbeifahrenden Boote zu beobachten. Eve hatte für schöne bequeme, verstellbare Holzstühle gesorgt, Auflagen dafür gab es auch und zwei Decken für kühle Abende. Besonders schön war das Einschalten einer Lichterkette über dem Schiff bei Anbruch der Dunkelheit. Wir können die Unterkunft uneingeschränkt weiterempfehlen.  Für Großstadtverhältnisse relativ ruhige Location.<br/>Achtung für Leute die mit dem Auto anreisen! Den PKW äußerst zügig entladen. Dort patrouillieren Aufpasser, die den ruhenden Verkehr kontrollieren und dann die Polizei rufen. Das wird uns, laut Polizei, 90€ kosten. Dann den Park und Ride Service nutzen, der wirklich günstig ist, 1 € für 24 Stunden plus 5€ für das Bahnticket für 2 Personen, Eve oder die Eltern werden den Standort gerne erklären.<br/>Besonders empfehlen können wir das Restaurant Bloem Eten & Drinken, was fussläufig in der Entrepotdok  gegenüber der Fußgängerbrücke liegt.  Der Schwerpunkt liegt  auf regionaler und biologischer Küche bei fairen Preisen.<br/><br/>PS: Eve ich hoffe deiner Katze geht es wieder besser.<br/>Liebe Grüsse<br/><br/>Kirsten und Robert Die Gastfreundschaft von Theo und Helga war fantastisch. Sie haben bei Ankunft den Kühlschrank mit einigen Lebensmitteln und Orangensaft bestückt. Die Unterkunft ist "
32878738,We had a wonderful stay at Bronte's apartment! She was so nice about everything when in touch with us and even provided some extra information about what to see and do in the surroundings. Thank you so much Bronte :)
32880846,It was a Great weekend in Amsterdam! Super Appartement and a very cool Host. Could not be better!
32885228,"It was a pleasure to stay in her house! She greeted us with a big smile, and she explained so kindly about her house and the city. Unfortunately, she suddenly became sick so we didn't have much time to talk together. But she communicated with us through airbnb message. Thanks to her, i got a good memory about holland. Thanks, vibeke! :)"
32901665,We were welcomed upon arrival and the room was exactly like the photos!
32910633,"Floris' apartment is really big and clean. It's placed near the city center, in a quiet place. Public transportation close to the location. <br/>He was so helpful with all the info he gave us!!! We will come back!"
32923395,"Nuestra experiencia fue fantástica. En todo momento nos sentimos como en nuestra propia casa, y tuvimos la suerte de conocer a Joke y Gerard, 2 personas maravillosas que nos trataron estupendamente y estuvieron atentas con cualquier cosa que necesitamos. Desde luego que, la próxima vez que volvamos a Amsterdam, este lugar será el que escojamos para hospedarnos. No se me ocurre mejor opción :)<br/><br/>Gracias por todo!!."
32934719,"Excellent accueil et en français :-)<br/>Petit coin sympathique, à l'écart du centre mais à 5 min à pied de l'arrêt de tram qui mène au centre.<br/>L'appart était très propre, fonctionnel et très bien équipé. <br/>Merci à Karin pour toutes les petites attention (dosettes café, thé, jus, pains, oeufs, fromage...)<br/>Hôte très sympatique, chaleureuse, de très bon conseils et disponible.<br/>Une excellente adresse que je recommande à tous."
32957884,Very nice apartment and Paul is very nice. No problems at all.
32993440,"Edith was a wonderful host with a perfect room. She greeted me with coffee and we chatted about the city and her suggestions of places to go and explore. She also lent me a very detailed map of Amsterdam, which I used quite a bit. She's extremely professional about renting out the room and had thought of everything I could ask before I did. The bed is comfy, the private bathroom is very nice, and the provided coffee and tea in the room made the stay extremely pleasant. I also couldn't have asked for a more perfect location. It's perfect for not only exploring the old city center, but seeing other neighborhoods that Amsterdam as to offer. This was my first time using AirBnB and traveling as a solo female and Edith made my stay better than I could have imagined. The stairs are definitely a hike though so this is probably not the place for you if you have more than a ""carry-on"" sized bag."
33021744,"Merin is a welcoming host. She made it easy for us every step of the way - from getting the key at a late hour to a bottle of wine, coffee and cream. Merin responds quickly and kindly to messages. The neighbourhood is close to the very center of Amsterdam, yet not too close to the bustle. There are bus and tram lines on either end of this quite street. It is even possible to walk to the Dam.  It is a lovely neighborhood on its on. The appartment is rich with natural light, and exactly as shown in the pictures. In fact, I did need some eye blinds to nap at noon, being there in june. Spacious, light coloroed, spotless - the place is relaxed and homey. The appartment is on the second floor and itself is devided to two floors, so be prepared to use the typical duch steep stairs. All and all the place, neibourhood and host - I highly recommend Merin's appartment. "
33035156,"Micha was very friendly host, the house was excellent, he provided us every information of the city, definitely 5 star"
33049570,"Really cozy place in a very, very good location. Even though Tessa & Romain were not there, everything went very smoothly.<br/>The room is not very soundproof and opens to a staircase where there was a lot of activity during the night on the weekend."
33061556,"Vibeke was lovely as could be very helpful and acomidating. Actually sorry we couldn't spend more time together , feel like I have a new Dutch friend which is awesome! "
33122980,"Wij werden zeer hartelijk welkom geheten door Andrea. Bij ontvangst kregen we een duidelijke uitleg aan de hand van een door haar samengestelde map en tevens zijn er voldoende folders op de kamer aanwezig. De kamer ziet er mooi, sfeervol en fris uit. De bedden zijn heel comfortabel! Enig minpuntje: de buurt kan op het eerste oog een beetje afschrikken, met name in de avond/nacht. Toch hebben wij er geen onveilig gevoel aan overgehouden indien je niet als vrouw alleen rondloopt maar minimaal met twee bent. Met de metro en/of bus ben je redelijk snel in het centrum of bij de Ziggo Dome. Hiertoe vonden wij deze B&B vooral ideaal gezien we 1 avond naar de Ziggo Dome gingen en het fijn is dat bij terugkomst met de nachtbus het maar 1 halte is tot aan de B&B. In de buurt hebben wij gegeten bij  Meram, gelegen op de Bijlmerdreef. Erg lekker en ideaal voor als je iets in de buurt wilt eten. In het centrum hebben wij bij Brasserie Van Dam gegeten wat ontzettend lekker was en een hele leuke sfeer! "
33138397,"I had a great time in Ellie's apartment. It was very clean, cozy, and close to everywhere I needed to go. It's a nice walking distance to both the touristy areas of Amsterdam and some hip neighborhoods. It is also conveniently located along one of the tram lines which makes it easy to get to/from the train station. There are many restaurants, cafe's nearby and a grocery store right down the street. <br/><br/>I would highly recommend this place to anyone!"
33167196,"We had an awsome time at Romans apt.<br/>He met us to give us the keys and explain about the house rules. And was very welcoming and gracious.<br/>The apt itself is amazing! Its set up perfectly for 2 couples or a family with kids. We were a group of four friends and was perfect for us.<br/>Very spacious! Just as it looks in the photos and even better.<br/>The location is great with the most amazing view out the large windows. A five minute walk from Leidseplein and Vondelpark.<br/>We would definately stay there again given the chance. Willems place is awesome!<br/>I often stay at Airbnb, and have been in Amsterdam many times.  The apt was better than I expected. Lots of little touches that seem trivial but make all the difference. <br/>The location is a tiny bit out of the center, so take in mind that it's about a half hour leisurely walk to the center, but there are plenty of tram lines that will take you there and it's a 2 minute walk to the beautiful Oosterpark and the main trams."
33182921,"Totesie was amazingly friendly and helpful during our stay. Her place was welcoming and she provided food, wine and allowed us to use the bus cards she has.<br/>The place was easy to find and we arrive late in the evening so Totesie left us a key in a secure key box at the door — super helpful!<br/>The common areas are filled with trinkets and bizarre props. Totesie has a large collection of 'things' to peruse.<br/>The room was very small, however (it was really a double bed squeezed into a single room). Also note the room is a few floors up on a very narrow, curving, staircase which isn't desirable if you have large suitcases."
33220628,"Superbe nous avons été accueilli comme des amis et avons reçu une bouteille de vin comme cadeau d entree<br/>des bonnes adresses pour la visite de la ville et des restaurants, à conseiller aux français et aimé par les français "
33256834,"Lovely Home! Amazing Family Vacation! Our family of 4 rented this charming home for our first trip to Amsterdam and we could not have been more pleased with our overall experience. At first I thought the home would be located too far out of the center of the city to conveniently enjoy all the attractions, but as it turned out, the charming neighborhood and enjoyable bike rides to and from the City were the best part of our stay. The home is so charming & spacious and we loved the ground floor (kitchen & eating area) and the sliding doors leading out to the beautiful lush back yard. Martine was a pleasure to work with and made us feel very welcome in her lovely family home. I highly recommend this home to any group or family of 4-6 that are looking to enjoy an authentic Amsterdam experience. We will definitely stay in this home again on our next highly anticipated visit to Amsterdam (my kids new favorite city!) "
33267090,"Jean-Paul and Lidia have been very helpful before and during the trip. <br/>The flat is very warm, well situated (near VongelPark), stairs are a part of the charm (second floor). <br/>Ideal location to disciver the city !<br/>We were 4,  the flat size was perfect and it is well accomodated.<br/>We had a real pleasure to stay there and can only advice you to book it ! "
33287725,"Everything was perfect, and everything was just like the pictures and descriptions.  Wendy is gracious, patient and very accommodating. I am so thankful we found Wendy and her apartment. She is a jewel..."
33291884,Logement comme attendu et décrit. Très bon accueil!!
33292747,"Toetsie was an amazing host! Very relaxed and kind, with two of the sweetest cats ever. The location is perfect for getting into Amsterdam central by any transport; metro, tram, bike, walk etc. And right next to a beautiful park. If you're visiting amsterdam, this is a must stay"
33342430,It`s a really nice place and Toetsie is a perfect host!
33351000,"We found the apartment clean and in a great central location.<br/>Thought it was a house-boat ... was surprised to find it was an apartment.<br/>Karin was welcoming and pleased to assist in any way.<br/>We appreciated Karin's assistance to find a doctor when needed...and also a nearby pharmacy.  "
33365139,"Very nice and cosy appartment in a great neighbourhood with lots of cafes restaurants. <br/>Also the hosts are very helpfull and responsive. We had a great stay, would defenitly book again. "
33390174,"The place is truly perfect! The directions that they provide are super helpful and much appreciated! The location is central to everything that Amsterdam has to offer, it was great! We were able to walk to whatever we needed. Francina was out with a hurt leg, hope she's better now, but Matthijs was the best host we could have ever asked for. They had an entire book with the best places to see, eat and things to do in full description. It was wonderfully helpful! The room and bathroom were both very clean which made us feel so at home and comfortable. Even though we shared the bathroom with the room across the hall we never once saw our ""room mates"" or had any trouble getting into the restroom when we needed! I would highly recommend this place to anyone. In fact the friends that we were traveling with stayed in a different place when we visited but when they passed through Amsterdam on their way back to the states they ended up staying here for their last night and they loved it as well! "
33420664,Was a nice and clean room. House needs a little bit renovation ;-) Very nice host.
33443440,"Better than a hotel - really!! A perfect location right by the red light district. You walk right out of your room into the bustling city street; it feels like you're really living in Amsterdam and not just visiting. The place is immaculately clean, fully stocked with wifi, maps, and brochures, and David couldn't be nicer. He was able to accommodate us last minute and we had a fantastic stay. Book right away!! "
33447724,"Very good stay in this friendly and well positioned apartment. We don't had direct contact with the host but with a rental agency. However, they are very professional , kind and we could drop off our bags on their premises once the check-out made."
33469318,Toetsie was a fabulous host. She provided great instruction on how to take the train from the airport. I arrived to a bottle of wine and a lovely space. She provided all information needed for the neighborhood and public transportation. Location was great. Many great bars and restaurants very close. Highly recommend!
33507904,"Notre séjour chez Laura et Arjan était super. Les hôtes sont très accueillants et disponibles. Le petit déjeuner est copieux et très bon. Laura nous a donné des adresses de restaurants où nous avons très bien mangé. <br/>L'appartement est très bien et le grand lit est très confortable. Le quartier est agréable car légèrement isolé du centre et au bord de l'eau.<br/>Nous reviendrons certainement lors de notre prochain séjour à Amsterdam."
33552559,"Matthijs and Francina were both lovely hosts. They were very welcoming and helpful about how to get around Amsterdam. My girlfriend and I definitely enjoyed the experience and our little dutch style room! The breakfast vouchers they provide are for a small corner bakery down the street. ""The Last Crumb"" was absolutely delicious and fresh. You get a croissant, freshly made juice, bread roll, some cheese, meat, and a coffee of choice. I highly recommend RUST and will be staying there in the future!"
33624303,"We enjoyed staying at the ""sweetest studio"" so much! The address was easy to find, there are a bus and tram near by and the area is very pretty and safe.<br/>When we arrived, we had a very warm welcome and there were even maps and bus schedules in the appartment. The studio itself is really nice, clean and the furniture is good as well. <br/>We would always be very happy to come back! <br/>"
33639885,"2 thumbs up to David's place.  Superb location, very clean and perfect for a nice getaway in Amsterdam.  David is also very nice and welcoming.  Even before we went there he answered all our questions on stuff to do in Amsterdam.  He also has a lot of information and coupons in his house that you can use.  I strongly recommend this place if you want to spend a nice vacation in the busy areas of Amsterdam. "
33672145,Tres joli appartement en rez de chaussée d'une résidence très calme située dans un quartier très proche de Vondelpark et des musées . Un jardin sur cour très agréable. Tout est prévu par l'accueillante propriétaire pour que le séjour vous laisse un souvenir inoubliable. Un conseil : se garer à l'Olympic stadium (4j/4€) et louer des vélos. La meilleure façon de découvrir Amsterdam
33682977,"In one word: superb. Dirk's house has everything one needs to feel like a true Amsterdamer. It's very well located, in a residential/quiet neighbourhood offering all the amenities: groceries store, bagel/coffee shop, bicycle rentals, restaurants. The area is 10 mins away from the touristic places, so one gets to meet mainly locals, very friendly local people. After a couple of hours in Dirk's flat, you'll feel as if it was your home. Beautifully decorated, very comfortable, super-clean, spacious,... exactly like in the photos. Dirk was also a great host: welcoming, communicative and friendly. I plan to visit Amsterdam again, I will definitely choose Dirk's place again."
33692082,房东Joke是一个很重视生活品质的人，善良又热心，每天都会准备丰盛的早餐给我们，擅长各种厨艺，非常推荐来此居住！
33717611,"Aucune mauvaise surprise : Anneke sait recevoir et veille à tous les détails pour que le séjour se passe parfaitement. La péniche est magnifique, le confort est total, le petit déjeuner succulent et le quartier très agréable. Nous avons passé de très bons moments avec Anneke et la remercions pour sa gentillesse !"
33756691,"Wendie and Hans were the perfect hosts. When we arrived Wendie was there to meet us & give us lots of top tips for our holiday. The room & bathroom was lovely and very private. The apartment is very central so super easy to walk everywhere. We loved our stay, thank you Wendie and Hans!"
33759664,"Le logement est bien situé, quartier très vivant, juste à coté du marché aux fleurs et au cœur du centre ville. On peut tout faire à pieds ou à vélo. La chambre est propre, conforme à la description et la literie est confortable. Edwin est super accueillant, avec le sourire et une énergie communicative, il vous montre ce que vous pouvez visiter et il n'hésite pas à vous aider ou répondre à vos questions. J'y retournerai et le conseille à mes proches sans hésiter ! Merci encore Edwin pour cet agréable séjour chez vous ! <br/><br/>The flat is well located, lively neighborhood, next to the flower market and downtown. You can do everything on feet or by bike. The room is clean, consistent with the description and the bedding is comfortable. Edwin is a great welcoming, with a smile and an catchy energy, he shows you what you can visit and he does not hesitate to help you or answer your questions. I will return and recommend it to my family again! Edwin, thank you again for a lovely stay at home!"
33764008,"Toetsie was very welcoming. She greeted me at the apartment as soon as I arrived in town, gave me a tour of the accommodations, and showed me a spare bike that I could use during my stay. She even had a bottle of organic wine for me and ingredients to make breakfast in the morning. Apartment was very nice and tidy. The bike enabled me to get around town conveniently and like a true local. Great hostess and a great place to stay!"
33808904,"Hi there , the appartement is really nicely located , and kate was a great host ! I do recommend ! "
33830465,The apartment is really nice and clean. It's 2 mins walk from a tram station and 20 mins walk to the downtown area. I didn't get to meet Stephanie but her boyfriend helped me moving in. They were really nice and very easy to reach. The only downside is that the apartment doesn't have an elevator so there are a lot of stairs. Overall I highly recommend it!
33853916,"Paul is a nice host. He welcomed me warmly and in French. The flat is very well situated in De Pijp which is a very nice and living neighborhood.<br/>There was unfortunately a flood in the flat when I was there.<br/>The flat is a bit wet, noisy and it miss cupboards."
33866594,"Could not have been more perfect! Mike was an excellent and attentive host, more than ideal location (nice part of amsterdam and walking distance from a lot of restaurans and shops), and the apartment itself was great. It looks just like the pictures - well decorated, clean, very comfortable bed, and nice shower (he even provides towels and shampoo). The bathroom (just toilet + shower) is quite small, but clean and very nice. Great, well-sized kitchen as well. Thanks for everything , Mike!"
33868677,Harold nous a réservé un acceuil tres chaleureux et tres sympathique. Son boat est tres bien équipé et corespond tout a fait au fotos du site. Le boat est également ttes bien situer a proximité d un arret de tram qui vous amene au centre d Amsterdam en 10min. En bref nous avons passer agreable moment chez notre hote Harold. A conseiller.  
33876795,The place was beautifully located near the center of Amsterdam in the Jordaan area. The studio is small but has everything you need for a short stay. Kitchen is well equipped and bed is comfortable. The host was helpful when needed.
33907366,"I thoroughly enjoyed staying here. Petra is a lovely and accommodating host.  She answered all my questions quickly before and during our stay. The place looks exactly as in the photos and is absolutely lovely and clean.  Great location too, I would very happily stay here again.  Thank you Petra."
33921821,"Our stay with Toetsie was so great!! She made us feel welcome and comfortable right away.

Also, the roof the apartment is incredible and has a great view! "
33971801,"Everything was good, no complains. I highly recommend this place."

Kees arranged every things for us to have a nice stay.<br/>The neighbourhood is kid friendly and very quiet.<br/>Parking is free and easy, and we could reach Amsterdam city center in just a few minutes.<br/>We would definitely recommend it to anyone."
34136977,"This is the third time I have traveled to and stayed in Amsterdam and staying at this home with such a kind host was definitely a great part of the trip. Marion is really kind and her room was so amazing with beautiful flowers in view. She treated us to an amazing breakfast and it was so delicious, she was also a joy to talk to. I definitely recommend her to stay for anyone. "
34167935,"We didn't meet Corina until our second day in the apartment as she had just returned from her holiday. However she was very friendly and ensured that everything was fine for us. The apartment was in an excellent location which was convenient for shops, cafes and bars. It was also close to tram stops as well as the Airport Express bus. Corina was kind enough to take us to the bus stop on our departure. The ground floor room was clean and tidy with an excellent shower. It was pleasantly furnished with plenty of soft lighting as well as overhead lighting. It was perfect for a good night's sleep as the room was quiet and the king sized bed was extremely comfortable. The wifi connection was excellent."
34173397,"Good location, the apparment is very nice but the bathroom is one of the worse I have seen. <br/>Very small, no lamp and with all the cables of the house visible (telephone, fiber, electricity...).<br/>Apart from that what I think is easy to improve I would recommed it."
34205654,A place where make us feel like home! Definitely will come back again. Not forgetting to mention the host is pretty friendly and nice! 
34248096,It's a pleasant home to stay and the lovely family is being so friendly and helpful!  The beautiful sea view and those cute ducks are totally worth it. You will hv privacy in your room. The decoration of the guest house is also great! So bad I couldn't stay longer! <br/>I will definitely recommend this one.
34254444,"Micha is the kindest host we have ever met. His being extremely nice and friendly had made our days. As for the room, it's very clean, spacious, and located near the metro that actually facilitated our journey to everywhere. we highly recommend this place and would be back to stay there for sure if we were back to Amsterdam. "
34260309,"It was good, except some disturbance due to mice (Rat)  and also there are so many things of the house owner !!<br/><br/>Rest all were absolute good."
34285790,"Olaf is simply the best host. He was very accommodating and even took some requests just to make us feel a little bit more comfortable. His apartment was literally the happiness place on earth---it's filled with Disney characters. The location is GREAT. We found the place at an ease and the neighborhood is just filled with great shops, cafes and restos. Overall, I believe our Amsterdam trip would be not be as fun and comfortable because of Olaf and his place. When i visit Amsterdam again, i will definitely be in Olaf's place again."
34309120,"The host was unable to meet us.<br/>So we had to go to the office to pick up our keys.<br/>The apt was futher than the 10 min walk more like 20.<br/>Which makes a difference when carting luggage.<br/>If a correct estimated was givin by the staff, I would have gotten an uber .<br/>And the stairs were a challenge after waking 20 minutes with bags.<br/>The apt was nice,<br/>And comfortable."
34327311,"Arjan and his girlfriend Prema are exceptional guests !<br/>I had a wonderful stay, and they really made me feel like home !<br/>Their two dogs are so cute and funny.<br/>The bedroom is really nice, I slept well and rested.<br/>If I am to come back to Amsterdam, I would definitely go back at their place and bring some friends of mine with me !"
34334400,Marion人特别好，跟她在一起很开心。她很有艺术细胞，很享受生活。房间布置的特别温馨，早餐让我们受宠若惊。房间没什么可挑的，交通便利，四周都是饭店和超市，很方便。另外她还提供自行车，骑到中央火车站也很方便。
34335447,"Atanas is very helpful and friendly! The host is beautiful! You have your own room, bathroom and toilet. The host is looks just on included photos. We have had a kettle, microwave oven and coffee maker. The bed is very big and comfortable. The district is full of shops and restaurants. Atanas prepared for us the map with around places. We had a wonderful trip, thanks to the fact that we have chosen an Atanas`s apartment . Highly recommend!"
34337080,"David happily welcomed us into the lovely Velvet Amsterdam B&B even when our flight was delayed. B&B situated in the perfect location, easy to find, and extremely pleasant accommodation. Would highly recommend to anyone looking to explore Amsterdam!!"
34402758,Olaf was a very kind host with a very special place. Lots of fun Disney and cartoon memorabilia. Definitely the most interesting Air B n B I've ever been in. He was very helpful and flexible about arriving and leaving times. The neighborhood was very nice and around a lot of good restaurants and cute shops.
34449965,"The apartment was perfect for the two of us. More than enough room. Very clean and tidy. The breakfast provided was excellent. We had no problems whatsoever, and would highly recommend this apartment. <br/>Also, the location was perfect. We chose to walk everywhere that we wanted to go. Nothing of interest was more than a 25 minute walk away. Central station was no more than a 15 minute walk. Bikes and trams are also very easily accessible."
34486815,"We had a very good experience. Host Evert is very pleasant and helpful. The room is as advertised: classy and very well located. an excellent place.<br/>"
34526968,"My friend and I absolutely loved staying with Marion and Jung. The place was very easy to get to from the airport/Sloterdijk and very quiet and peaceful. Marion and Jung were extremely inviting and we enjoyed having conversations about music, traveling, and motorcycles over the traditional Dutch breakfast they provided. They also let us borrow their bikes and map and bike out to the local windmill. This is a great place to stay if you want to experience dutch life outside of the city. It does take about half an hour to get to the city using public transportation from their place. Marion and Jung are very helpful in recommending various ways to get to the city and places to see, things to do, and where to eat."
34532529,Marga and Rico were so helpful and kind.  They went out of their way to help me by picking me up at the train station even though the train was late.  I really enjoyed my time there.
34533908,"I would recommend staying at Anne's place to anyone I know. My cousin and I stayed there for 2 nights over the weekend. Although Anne was on a trip and could not greet us, she made sure everything is covered and we feel like at home. Before we even got there Anne sent us very detailed info about her house, how to get there and all other helpfull info. She was very quick in responding to all our questions. Once we got there we were very happy to see that the place is exactly as it was in the photos - very nice, comfy and clean. Also, Anne left us a bunch of brochures and maps of Amsterdam in the apartment. That was great for someone who is in Amsterdam for the first time. We were also very happy with the location - 2 minute walk to tram station, 5 minute walk to Vondelpark. Overall - if I am ever again in Amsterdam I will check if Anne has an opening. :) "
34575085,It's an absolut wonderful place to stay if you wanna visit the Centre of Amsterdam as quick as possible but you don't wanna noise neighbour's. Laura and her Family were all absolut friendly and as kind and helpful as possible. I would absolutely stay at this place again.
34583882,"Nice house outside of the city center. Nima was helpful and very nice to help when we needed. Very clean and tidy room very well located in a nice ""clamer"" neighborhood than the busy city center. Right beside the Vondelpark. We had a great time thanks to Jady&Eva's room :)"
34591257,"I really felt at home at Toetsie's place. She welcomed me very friendly, had some chats with me or lend me her spared bike. The room was tiny and lovely as described in the ad, with basic cooking possibilities in the kitchenette. The public space/living room is a perfect extant to the small room for some reading or chats. On my next trip to Amsterdam I will defintily stay at hers again :)"
34598643,"My girlfriend and I stayed here for 2 nights and had an incredible time. The hosts are extremely generous and are willing to help out their guests however they can. We got an amazing breakfast brought to us both mornings and it was the perfect start to our day. The basement apartment is a great space for a couple and was nice and warm when we arrived. We slept really well on the bed and the shower is wonderful. We walked everywhere, from the train station to the apartment and from the apartment all over the city. I would highly recommend staying here and hopefully I will get the chance to come back in the summer months!"
34609828,"Toetsie is so sweet and always help you with everything you need. Her place is really close to the center, I walked from there until the Heineken experience and spent 15min. But you can also take the tram number 7 and get there in 10min. I really recommend her and want to come back soon ;)"
34612602,"This was my first airbnb experience and I have to say that Mathilde is an excellent host. She is very communicative and cheerfull. We stayed at her appartment for three nights and everything was great. The space is very big, clean and comfortable. It really felt like we were at home. The neighbourhood is also very nice and quiet. Next time I'm in Holland I willl definitely stay at the same place. I recommend Mathilde as a host and her appartment 110%."
34632129,"Toetsie was very welcoming and the room was exactly as described in the listing. She was always helpful and she went to great lengths to ensure that we were comfortable during our stay. <br/>The neighbourhood around the apartment is very nice and we particularly enjoyed the nearby organic supermarket, the local bars and the amazing Thai restaurant. Additionally we had easy access to public transportation from the nearby subway stop.<br/>Definitely worth a recommendation!"
34652772,"We had a problem with our delayed flight and had arrived at 01.30AM, so Olaf had to wait for us. I was so worried, but Olaf was super great. He took a time to explain everything and we felt like at home. Rooms very clean, cozy and colourful. The flat is close to the centre and most of the time we walked everywhere. In close distance is big food market, shops, restaurants, museums, park. You can take tram number 4, from central station, no need to change the numbers. I recommend the flat for everyone (expect stairs as this is Netherland), pity we didn`t have time to drink a wine at the roof terace. Beautiful view. Thank you, Olaf :-)"
34689562,Sally's apartment was perfect for our stay. The apartment is very comfortable to relax inside and in a great location to explore the city.
34702079,"Toets is great and awesome! This was my first experience with AirBnB and Toets have left me speechless with awe. Even before reaching her house, Toets had me aware of all the events and to-do stuffs during my travel. One of this included Le Grand Départ event flagging off Le Tour de France. If it wasn't for Toets message, I would have just visited Amsterdam, roamed around like one of those dumb tourist walking around, and went away, but luckily this wasn't the case. <br/><br/>She guided me with various other aspects like provided a map, public transportation, tours, etc. The place I stayed was very clean. She provided me with almost everything including towels, utensils, soaps, food, wine, juice, breakfast, books to read, adorable cats to play with, roof-top balcony to enjoy that morning sip of hot coffee, etc. etc. etc. etc. (a BIG list)<br/><br/>Upon request, she also provided me with certain utilities, and she didn't even charge me for that! <br/><br/>Toets is a great host, that you won't regret. <br/>Like I told her before, why do people go to hotels when you have .... !"
34715630,"Je ne me suis pas sentie a l'aise des le départ qd on m'a annoncé que notre pièce c'était juste là et que nous n'aurions pas accès au reste du logement pourtant en photo sur le site.<br/>Ce logement ne correspond pas à ce que j'avais contracté.<br/>Je n'ai pas rencontre Marijke qui était représentée par un monsieur qui habitait le logement en son absence. <br/>Très déçue."
34728451,"Olaf was a great host! Although we were only there for a night, he greeted us warmly and explained everything thoroughly. He took the time to answer any questions we had and give us recommendations on what we should do during our short, 24 hour visit to Amsterdam. The room was cozy, colorful and clean and the apartment is a short walk or tram ride to the city center. It's a great area- super close to a big open air market too! We certainly recommend Olaf no matter the duration of your stay! "
34750793,"The room was furnished just like a hotel. Plenty of space and very comfortable feeling. <br/><br/>Martine did an amazing job at accommodating all of our needs. She knows a lot about the city and upon arrival took extra time to recommend where to go and what to avoid. She made sure we had everything we needed and really went above and beyond what I expect from a host.<br/><br/>Very easy to get in and out of the city. I would be happy to stay here again.<br/>"
34779888,"La casa es muy linda, pero la habitación más aún. La cama era muy cómoda. En cuanto a ubicación, nosotros nos tomábamos el tranvía hasta el centro porque eran varias cuadras caminando. La habitación y el baño no estaban muy limpios."
34935329,"Toetsie is an amazing hostess :-)<br/>"
34957357,Nous sommes ravis du séjour que nous venons de passer. Nous avons été très bien accueillis dans ce charmant logement situé à proximité du centre-ville. Nous le recommandons fortement ainsi que les petits déjeuners exquis! Merci Laura & Arjan! Et peut-être à bientôt...
34965715,"Great first experience of Air BNB! Rosie the host was friendly, helpful and informative. Great location, 10-15 minute walk to Museam District. House was clean and decor was lovely. I would definatley consider staying again :)"
35008657,"We really loved the place and even more the location. We received our firt christmas gift from David, which make us very happy. He was very responsive all the time. The place has the perfect location..everything is near. I will highly recommend this place!"
35014729,"Apartment was just as small/ big as you see in the pictures. Toilet is in the corridor, was not so comfy in the morning. Never met Ruud, but his friend Diogo was amazing - friendly, gave advice about everything! Stairs with bigger luggage might be problem :) <br/>"
35016808,"We were so happy to stay in Anne-Marie's flat. Every thing functioned well. We could sit in the garden on a sunny day in April. Anne-Marie gave us very useful information so that we had four nice days in Amsterdam. It is easy to get to and from city center and central station 5 min by bike, and 7 min by shuttle ferry. Thanks to Anne-Marie we easily found our way to the countryside by bike. We rode our rented bikes to many places in Amsterdam. Anne-Marie's house is in a very quite area. We had a lot of relaxing time in the flat and in her garden. And it was so nice that we so easily could go by bike all over Amsterdam. It was very safe. Anne-Marie is so friendly and gives you all the information you need. We could contact her at any time - though we didn't need to do that because we did not run into any problems during our stay. We give Anne-Marie our best recommendations."
35017918,Everything was as described. David let us leave our bags as not flying till later in day. That made a huge difference. Lovely places for breakfast very near. Would recommend the old church cafe.
35024851,"Everything was very good - even a little better than described here at airbnb!<br/><br/>Before arriving to the apartment, the communication with Karen and her friend Catherine was very nice, reliable and relaxed.  Catherine was waiting for us at the appartment with the keys and gave us a nice introduction.<br/><br/>The neighbourhood is very good (save at night and nice quite & green streets with good restaurants and stores around). The next tram station is only 3 minutes away and you get to center quickly.<br/><br/>The nice and bright apartment (maybe around 140m² !) is fully equipped with everything you need. The beds are comfortable, internet was fast and there was also a small balcony. <br/><br/>We enjoyed our trip to amsterdam and would fully recommend Karen`s apartment.  It is much better than staying at a hotel!"
35034114,"The hosts for Iambnb were a friendly helpful staff looking out for the guests. I unfortunately did not get a chance to stay at this Bnb, however the Iambnb guys contacted me and helped me select a new Bnb which were equal or better value. Which ended up being much better and in a central location."
35115268,Un très bon moment avec un accueil sympathique et même une grande touche de gentillesse avec des cadeaux en fin de séjour<br/>Merci
35116971,The experience was great. The host was really friendly and helpful 
35117610,"Staying with Marga was truly a joy. She and her family was very welcoming and the neighborhood was quiet and safe. She allowed us to rent her bikes, which was helpful. Our room was large and equipt with a water boiler to make tea, fresh towels, and many maps to borrow. Everything was clean and the overall atmosphere was positive and refreshing. The room is on land next to Marga's floating family home so we could see the water and hear the birds every day. Thank you Marga! I would love to stay again someday:)"
35144911,"Micha is one of the best hosts that I met! He is very disponible and friendly, He helped us for moving around Amsterdam and what to do. The house is very big and clean, it is near the metro and train station so it's very easy for move by there. If I will come back in Amsterdam I will ask to Micha again!"
35179592,"Long story short,we loved our stay at Tessa's house!<br/>She has made us feel welcome before we even made the booking and helped us with evry qustion we have.<br/>When we arrived to the house it was exactly as seen in the picures and she even left us a bottle of wine and ingredients with a recepie to cook  a meal for our first night!<br/>The house itself is perfect for familys with kids,it has a specious living room and kitchen and toys (especialy lego) for the kids to make them occupied when indors.<br/>The nighborhood is very quiet but only 10 min drive from the city center and the museum area.<br/>Tessa also had evrything amazingly orgenized with a booklet explaining how to work things out around the house.<br/>All in all evrything was great, and i wholeheartedly recommend it.<br/>Thanks agian to Tessa and her family for letting us stay at thier home and for being such a great family and hosts!"
35188722,"Fantastic apartment, very cosy, clean and homely. Great location, no need to take trams you can walk to all attractions. Roman was helpful and was able to let us check out slightly later as we had a late flight. Defiantly recommend and would stay again. 🙂 "
35228198,"The apartment is incredibly nice! Great location, easy access, very secure,  GEORGEOUS view!!!   We were three people - one slept on a sofa - decent, while bedroom is perfect.  Kitchen has all you ever need,  and the living room is comfortable and really spacious. Ingo was a very nice host, all was easy and fast - just as we wanted. the instructions in the apartment (on EVERYTHING - from sightseeing to bar and restaurants recommendations) - perfect. Thank you, we will be back :)."
35241418,"Bardzo miła rodzina i niesamowie miejsce! W jadalni kaczki podpływają pod samo okno. W pokoju gościnnym pianino z którego z przyjemnością skorzystałem. Polecam!<br/><br/>Marga's family is most welcoming and her place is extrardinary! You can admire the ducks and swans on the channel coming just to their dinng room window (which is 30cm above water :) . In the guesthouse there'a a piano which I gladly made use of! Recommended!"
35253573,"Incredibly great location, spotless and modern, comfy bed, David was very helpful with directions and instructions. Cannot say anything bad, it was perfect. Would love to stay here again in the future. Thank you so much David :)"
35258054,"My friend and I absolutely loved our stay here!  It was so convenient to everything we wanted to see, with the benefit of being in a quiet part of the city.  The flat was very clean and the beds were super comfortable.  Oh, and I LOVED the coffee maker!  It is true as others have said that the stairs are intense, so try to pack light and you'll be just fine.  Also, Marielle provided us with a wonderful guide in the room for everything one would need to know once in Amsterdam.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful space with the world Marielle.  We will definitely be back!"
35285995,"El apartamento está muy bien situado, a quince minutos en tranvía de Central Station y cerca de un parque precioso. El vecindario es super agradable y tienes de todo muy cerca. La casa está fenomenal y Bart y Monique fueron encantadres. La recomiendo totalmente."
35307056,"Toetsie is very nice lady and very helpful. Apartment is near to the main city, easily connected to city centre. Near by tram connection and overall it is in good place. "
35343878,Laura and her husband were great hosts and surprised us by providing breakfast each morning. Laura was very helpful and the apartment was perfect. It was in a quiet area and still close to central Amsterdam. We would definitely stay here again the next time we visit.
35352889,"They are very good hosts and make an effort to help with information and advice about the city. The location is great. <br/>The photos do not show that there is a large and somewhat precarious step up to the bath, shower and toilet Which is not ideal for an older person. <br/>My departing flight was at 21.00hrs and they were not able to provide a facility for me to hold the luggage after check out time 11.00 which was rather inconvenient. "
35383356,"we had a great time in ginas garden house. very uncomplicated and nice people, gina and frans. the house is lovely and very clean. fruits on the table, beer in the fridge, everything was there what we needed. we'll be back in this nice little house, as soon as we go back to amsterdam. thanks a lot!<br/> "
35393468, Philip & Luchiena gave us a warm welcome ! We felt good in our private room. The place is well located ( not far from the center ) and you can have a walk next to the river and admire the boat ! Moreover the breakfast was gorgeous !
35408877,"Good room, good location. It can be a bit loud at night because it's close to the street, but apart from that everything was perfect."
35423863,"Hein ha sido muy amable y la comunicación con el es excelente. El apartamento esta muy bien ubicado, su organización y limpieza hacen de nuestra estadía una experiencia muy placentera. Sin dudas volveremos a hospedarnos aqui en nuestra proxima visita a amsterdam  "
35426864,"Toetsie is amazing!! We had such a wonderful time at her place and she made sure everything we needed was set up (ingredients for breakfast, bikes, even a bottle of organic wine!). The location is great (we walked everywhere we went and the train station is just a few steps away), the house is clean and the room is small but very cozy. Roky the cat is an added bonus to this lovely BnB. <br/>We highly recommend staying here. Thank you Toetsie, looking forward to seeing you again!"
35441830,"We loved staying here. A beautiful apartment in a quiet area but within walking distance of everything. Welcomed warmly at the airport by Arjan and later by Laura. They were on hand if we needed anything  (restaurant reservations made, thank you!). We would definitely stay here again (and look for the bottle opener more carefully to open the bottle of wine kindly left for us that we couldn't drink because I didn't find it!) Breakfast was lovely and lots of it. Thanks to Cherrie too for our breakfast deliveries. We highly recommended staying here. Thank you again for your great hospitality."
35444688,The apartment was very beautiful and in a good location. The communication and everything else went great.
35445856,We had a great time in Amsterdam!:) and the room helped to feel the city even more. Very clean! Smelling great. Location is good as well. 5 minutes walk to the shopping mall and 10 minutes by bus to the city centre. Free parking places was a good bonus! Very friendly host! Many thanks. Hope to see you again:)
35503043,Monique and Roland's apartment was perfect for our stay in Amsterdam. Monique was very helpful from the moment we arrived in assisting us in getting settled and feeling welcomed. They had a nice binder filled with tourist info to help us with ideas of places to eat and see as well as how to get around while our car was parked securely in their garage. The location was well situated with a quick and easy bus ride to the city center. The apartment was quiet and tidy with a nice private entrance off the garden and the bed was the most comfortable bed we slept in on whole trip. We would love to stay there again when we are back in Amsterdam and would recommend it to others who are looking for a quiet and comfortable spot just outside of the hustle and bustle of Central Amsterdam. Thank you for a fabulous stay!!!
35509944,"This was my first airbnb experience and although I don't have anything to compare it to, I really feel like Toetsie went over the top as a host! Everything was great, and she even let me use a bike and offered me wine on her rooftop. She also let me use her electric keyboard to practice a little - I had some concerts coming up so it was so helpful to be able to play a little during my stay. Thank you Toetsie for a great experience in Amsterdam!"
35518941,"Had a fantastic time at Marga's and would have stayed longer if I'd had the time! She has a lovely garden and a piano in the guest cottage, and was prepared to rent me a bicycle at a very good rate for the day and recommend some restaurants. Very generous and welcoming place to stay while in town."
35519118,"Really pleasant appartement. Spacious diner room and very great roof top. Leontine made everything easy for us to keep, return keys and our luggages. Very good location closed to the centre (2 tram stops only), to the vondel park and very good conexion with airport. Good restaurants and market on surroundings. We had a very good journey. Great journey at Leontine appartment. Good location only 2 stations from hypercentre by tram 1, and so easy to join the airport. Pleasant neighbourhoods (coffee plaza, restaurants, market). So great rooftop, and friendly spacious kitchen and diner room. And Leontine made everything easy for us to keep and return the keys and find solution for our luggages. We spent very good time!!"
35528601,"Merle var supertrevlig, tillmötesgående och svarade snabbt när vi hade några frågor. <br/>Lägenheten är fräsch och har allt man kan behöva, bilderna stämmer överens med hur vi upplevde den. <br/>Området är väldigt trevligt och det finns både bra shopping, restauranger och barer. Väldigt hippt. <br/>Vi kommer mer än gärna tillbaka! "
35529510,"Marga is a wonderful host. She was welcoming and patient when I first arrived, showing me the garden house and where the bathroom was in the (main) houseboat so I could freshen up following a long flight. She even offered me some delicious homemade dessert meant for her family, and we sat on a bench over the water and had a lovely chat. When I told her what I was looking for in the city, she immediately opened up the map and gave me detailed instructions on the best way of getting there.<br/><br/>Her home is located along the river, which makes for a very unique experience. It is a warm and cozy garden house, and the separation from the houseboat makes the privacy much appreciated! I made the amateur mistake of using a phone charger with the wrong voltage on the first night and blew the fuse in the room. She and her husband very kindly helped me fix that despite the fusebox being located in a shed outside. I had to leave early on my last day, and she woke up early to give me a ride to the train station. <br/><br/>Such patience makes Marga a lovely host and I definitely recommend her place. Thanks, Marga!"
35577559,Edwin is a wonderful host. He is very attentive and give you all the necessary informations. His appartment is very clean and sunny. We had an amazing stay in amsterdam thanks to him! 
35587099,I arrived to a very friendly and amiable malou accompanied with a bottle of wine (always a bonus!). Malou was very welcoming and made me feel right at home in her lovely and cool apartment - I look forward to returning to Amsterdam soon! Thank you!
35589838,"Great location for exploring Amsterdam. Short walk to cafes, markets, and public transportation. Easy check in. Cute apartment. Host was wonderful!"
35597306,"We only stayed one night but it couldn't have been lovelier. The location was easy walking distance to everything we explored, as well as to the tram to get around. Anneke's houseboat was beautiful inside and out - we loved sitting on the back porch watching boats go by in the canal. And finally, Anneke was a wonderful host. She shared several recommendations for the area, and cooked more breakfast than we could possibly have eaten!"
35616552,"listing was quite accurate, host was nice and polite<br/><br/>i barely seen him since me and wife were almost all the time out exploring amsterdam<br/><br/>deeply recommend this, next time im in amsterdam im booking it again if i can :)"
35641737,Didn't know that I can post a comment on Airbnb so here's the late comment: very nice house with two angel dogs! Love love love them! Although it has been  rainy for 3 days but the temperature inside is okay for me. Also I love the bed( not as too soft as French ones) Prema and Arjan were considerate and friendly. I personally like the color inside the house and the tiny decorations. The bath is also modern and easy to use! Nice stay! Hope to see u again next time in Amsterdam :)
35644633,"Supertolle Wohnung in zentraler Lage in Amsterdam mit supernetter Gastgeberin! Heleen hat uns wirklich wie alte Freunde empfangen und uns super Tipps für unserern Aufenthalt gegeben. Für uns vier Mädels war die Unterkunft einfach nur perfekt, auch weil sie so liebevoll eingerichtet ist."
35698294,"I stayed here with 4 friends for a weekend break in February 2016. The house was just as Leontine said, very close to 2 separate tram lines straight into the city centre and also very close to Vondelpark. It's a typical Dutch house (I'd imagine), the stairs were terrifying if you were carrying anything but that was really the only negative. The house was very clearly someone's home rather than a strict rental property so had a very lived-in feel to it. Leontine was very easy to work with and very flexible on arrival/leaving times which was nice as it meant we didn't have to rush on the last day. The cats as well were very sweet. I'd definitely recommend staying here!"
35764784,"We stayed in the apartment 22-26 august 2015 and was very satisfied. <br/><br/>The location is very central and has canal view at a bend – meaning just sitting and watching canal boats passing by is a pleasure itself. The apartment has in our opinion charm.  The hosts were nice and Michael even took the time to show us another apartment in the building were two young Jews were successfully hidden during WW2. This apartment has been left more or less unchanged since the WW2! <br/><br/>Being an old building and in the city centre it was not totally “noise free” but we guess that  compared to other locations in city town this is a quiet place.  <br/><br/>Our apartment had three rooms (or two rooms and the kitchen)  although they are not separated by doors. For the single bed in the 'living' room it can be a little bit difficult to get it really dark since the curtains of the many windows are quite transparent. It did not bother the one of us sleeping there but might be good to know. In the bedroom it was dark enough also for more light sensitive persons.  <br/><br/>We can only come up with two minor minus – many of the glasses in the cupboard was not at all clean but with a dishing machine it was not too difficult to fix. Secondly (which was pointed out to us when we were introduced to the flat) was that some water was running in the bathroom over the floor from the basin to the shower. It was not fixed during our stay but if you were careful when entering the bathroom you could easily avoid it. <br/><br/>Best regards<br/>Anders<br/>"
35771497,Sehr schöne Unterkunft und eine tolle Gastgeberin. Wir kommen gerne wieder!
35808323,"Heidi's house was absolutely beautiful, and a perfect place from which to explore Amsterdam. It is 15 minutes from Central Station, and 5 minutes from a metro stop - but everything in the city is within walking distance anyway.<br/><br/>The house was very clean, beds were incredibly comfortable, and the kitchen was a great space to cook and eat communal dinners. Everything we could have needed was provided! <br/><br/>Be aware that there are steep stairs to get up the 3 floors that this house covers, so if you have children or people with mobility problems, this might be an issue. <br/>"
35824233,"Fenno and his place were great. Clean and comfortable apartment with a welcoming, helpful host. I'd stay there again. "
35841480,"We had a wonderful time at the apartment. It is a great location - easy to get a tram into the centre but away from the hustle and bustle, and very peaceful. The park near by is beautiful with a lovely playground and little animal farm. <br/>The apartment is beautiful, open and bright and very stylish! Femke was very helpful. I definitely recommend staying here."
35844776,Great experience and great host. The host is very helpful and nice. I strongly recommend Rosie for travellers wanting very reliable accommodation at an inexpensive rate in a reasonably central location (15 mins by tram 35mn by walking to Amsterdam Central).
35868820,"Logement situé dans un quartier résidentiel du Nord d'Amsterdam, accès à Centraal Station en 10min en bus (direct) ou en 15min à vélo.<br/>Chambre avec mezzanine au 2ème étage, richement décorée (bonus pour les masques !), propre, avec bon réseau wifi.

Nous sommes arrivés en retard à cause des embouteillages dans Amsterdam mais notre hôte nous a attendu sans problème. les lits étaient faits, la salle de bain et le bateau très propres. Les filles ont adoré la terrasse pour donner à manger aux canards. Proche du tramway de restaurants du supermarché et à 20 mn de marche du centre d'Amsterdam. Nous sommes venus en voiture, il faut noter que le parking est à 27 euros la journée. Une très belle surprise. Allez y sans vous poser de question. c'est magnifique. Nous reviendrons et pour plus longtemps. Merci Lucas de nous avoir permis de partager votre maison. Nous avons ADORE !!!!!"

36127112,"Laura was a great host, her, her husband and Cherry went out of their way to help us with whatever we needed. They provided us breakfast every morning which was delicious and great start to a day of exploring the beautiful city of Amsterdam. The location was good and they even provided us with bikes. Last minute our brother chose to stay with us and they were very accommodating, providing him with breakfast and a bike also. Wifi was great and the shower was AMAZING! Would recommend staying here to anyone and would stay again in a heartbeat. Thank you for providing us with a fantastic place to stay ! "
36191200,"We spent a wonderful weekend with 8 persons (2 families) in this cute Amsterdam-typical home.<br/><br/>The house was big enough for all of us, well equipped, clean, with a beautiful small garden.<br/><br/>The hosts daughter was kind enough to pick us up at the local train station where she also returned us at the end of our stay. She provided us with some good information and tips as well.<br/><br/>Upon arrival we were surprised about a cake the family left to very warmly welcome us, which made everything a lot more personal.<br/><br/>We were also able to use their bikes, which came in very handy being in Amsterdam.<br/><br/>All in all we have had a very good time and it was a pleasant stay and we can highly recommend this accommodation."

The house is in a very quite area from 10 min to the Central Station by metro, the room is perfect, clean with all the equipment we need. Simone also let in the fridge all the food we need to prepare breakfast and she also make us a surprise for our Sunday breakfast giving us a “brioche”.<br/>Simone is also very helpful since she keeps our dog Eggy during our visits for free and gives him a walk in the park near the house.

36317760,We both really enjoyed our two night stay in Laura and Arjan's comfortable apartment. It was a lovely historic area to be in and to wander through and we found two great restaurants nearby. Everything we needed was supplied including a very generous breakfast. Being driven to the airport was the icing on the cake!! Thank you. 
36324324,"The apartment was very spacious, clean and well decorated; it's so lovely! It has everything you need to have a confortable stay (sheets, cook utensils, towels..). The neighborhood is very quiet, altough it's not near to the center there's a bus station nearby and you can also go by bike (if you want to feel like you're living there, try the bike!), and there's a supermarket, some restaurants and also cafeterias nearby.<br/>About Julie, she was the nicest host we could find! She was very helpful, she was always available and she answered every single question that we had (how to get to the apartment, how to move around the city...). She also lend us bikes, and she bought us some food and drinks to welcome us! <br/>If you're planning to go to Amsterdam we really recomend you to stay in Julie's apartment, not only for the lovely and confortable place, but for the help and attention that you'll recieve from Julie!"

En revanche, à notre arrivée, un de leurs amis nous a accueilli et à notre départ, nous n'avons pas pu les rencontrer. C'est dommage au vue de leur badge de super hôte."
36687387,"Petra was in contact with us immediately to offer assistance with regards to travel information and helpful routes and apps available to us, as well as ensuring that we have her contact details should we need any further support or information.  She was also very kind to agree to an early check in for 9 am so to accommodate our early arrival.The description and photos are very accurate- in fact I would say that the accommodation is even better than what is seen in the photos.The accommodation was in a lovely neighbourhood within the popular and elegant museum quarter and the beautiful Voldlepark.

From the location to the apartment everything was fabulous; we were nicely welcomed and everything about the house rules was nicely explained; the garden is perfect to hang out after a long day of walking around; the location is right in the center and perfect to go to the large market in pjip and jump on a tram to go to all attractions! I highly recommend this appartment!
37022110,"Hallo Matthjs en Francina, <br/>we hebben de tijd in Amsterdam genoten! Hartelijk bedankt voor de lieve begroeting en de vele informaties! Wie hebben alles goed  gevonden.

37038731,"Micha was such a nice and welcoming host. The place was big, clean, spacious, comfortable and had food available. Only 5mins away from the metro station and 10mins from the centre city by metro. When I return to Amsterdam I will definitely stay again in Calypso. <br/>Best regards"
37043533,"Partis à la découverte d'Amsterdam, mes deux enfants et moi avons été accueillis avec beaucoup de chaleur par Arjan & Prema. Leur appartement est très agréable, la terrasse reposante lors des après-midi ensoleillées (ce que nous avons eu la chance d'avoir !) et Cookie et Lieverd sont les chiennes les plus adorables que nous ayons rencontrées. Le quartier est lui aussi très sympa, loin du tumulte de l'hypercentre et pourtant bien desservi et fourni en commerces et restaurants pour le quotidien. Bref, une belle rencontre, un lieu de séjour très recommandable !!! "
37062167,"Harald en Edith zijn zeer gastvrije mensen. Ze hebben ons met open armen ontvangen. Verder hebben ze ons ook enorm veel informatie en leuke tips gegeven over de stad waardoor ons verblijf onvergetelijk werd. De kamer ziet er heel goed en proper uit. Door de recente renovatie is alles dik in orde. De kleine keuken is zeker ook een meerwaarde. Het is gelegen net buiten het centrum, maar alles is te voet bereikbaar.  Heel erg warme ontvangst! Kamer was helemaal in orde, goed gelegen in een gezellige buurt en gemakkelijk bereikbaar. Zou het sowieso nog een keer boeken!"
37132302,"Stephanie et Sebastian ont été très accueillant et nous ont très bien accueilli.<br/><br/>L'appartement est tres propre et très agréable.;-)<br/><br/>Merci pour tout.<br/>Patrick"

37243279,"Olaf's two nice rooms corresponded to the description. Everything was clean and well aranged. For us, the matrasses had just the right strength. Olaf is a friendly host and we had interesting hosts. Thank you Olaf for the strong belgium beer and the good coffee and the good advice for the african restaurant. And next time I'll find the right words for the partying students in the house oppsite to yours: Stil te graag!<br/>Highlight: the roof terrace.<br/>We strongly recommend Olaf's home to have a nice starting point not far from the city centre. If you fear for your expensive bike: leave them at public fiets bestalling at Amstel station."
37308235,"Viola & Daniel's apartment was amazing! Spacious, bright, stylish, and cosy. Looks just like the photos. The view is lovely, right by the canal. It's so close to the centre and has many transport links. Tram 3 is right in front of their place! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay there. <br/><br/>It was lovely to meet Viola and Daniel when we first arrived, very friendly and helpful. They've given us some very useful tips, made our stay in Amsterdam even better. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here when we find ourselves in Amsterdam again!"
37327119,I cannot praise the apartment and hosts enough. It was such a beautiful place to stay the photos do not do it enough credit. The location exceeded my expectations - the best place to stay in Amsterdam. Thank you so much Marijn for having us to stay and greeting us when we arrived even though we were late. We will one hundred percent be back 
37372867,Un peu à l'écart du centre mais l'appartement est cosy et permet de se reposer . On s'est senti comme à la maison... très agréable.
37376061,"Heel gezellige authentieke kamer vlak buiten Amsterdam. Fietsverhuur was ideaal zo kon ik me snel en eenvoudig naar het centrum verplaatsen. Goede ontvangst, heel vriendelijke verhuurders."
37382661,alles was conform verwachting (en meer);  bijzonder welkom gehad met fles wijn en stroopwafels.  alles klopte heerlijke rustige buurt en hee centraal gelegen. Lekker relaxen op het balkon aan de gracht 's avonds
37423528,"This place was lovely! Marga is wonderful host. I really recommend this place :)<br/><br/>"
37463057,"We hadden een super ervaring in Amsterdam! Al van bij de ontvangst was Fenno de ideale gastheer, altijd correct en snel in communicatie en heel open en vriendelijk. Er stonden zelfs al enkele frisse pintjes klaar in de frigo bij aankomst! <br/><br/>Het appartementje is niet zo centraal gelegen maar bevindt zich wel in een leuke buurt. Met wat wandelen of het gebruik van openbaar vervoer is alles wel vlot bereikbaar. <br/><br/>Een echte aanrader voor iedereen die Amsterdam bezoekt. Ideaal voor koppels maar, zoals in ons geval, ook zeer aangenaam met 3 vrienden (Fenno voorzag hiervoor een extra bed in de living). Eén van m'n betere airbnb ervaringen en zou hier zeker terugkeren bij een volgend bezoek aan Amsterdam. "
37500202,"Both Laura and Arjan are a wonderful host and we had a lovely memorable time in Amsterdam in their apartment.  We were driving from Lucerne (+800 kms) and our time of arrival was not certain due to traffic situations.....however, they ensured that everything was in place and that they were always contactable to us for any guidance and assistance on our arrival.  The daily morning breakfast hamper was a joy to receive each morning with freshly baked croissants, juices, eggs and yogurts.  We stayed there for four nights and the apartment met our requirements (family of four – 2 adults and 2 kids) as it is located to the west of the central station (taxi is EURO 10 to central station) which is the main city attraction and found the locality/neighborhood to be very calm, scenic, traditional buildings giving the whole experience a warmth and serene feeling.  The description of the apartment and the facilities available match and if there is any concern they are there to assist.  Both went beyond their host duties and made everything easy with their guidance on parking facility, tour guidance, places to visit and tips to avoid and be careful in crowded public places.  Our children were also welcomed to their apartment to play with their kids (as they were of same age) and had a lovely time together.  Overall, they are an excellent host and take pride in hosting people and ensuring that the guest leaves with wonderful enjoyable and loving memories of Amsterdam.  A perfect home away from your home.   I am sure we have made friends for a lifetime and will recommended them and surely visit them again. <br/>Regards,<br/>Astha, Prakash, Sankalp and Sidak."
37516387,"From start to finish Laura & Arjan could not do enough to make our stay a comfortable & pleasant experience! The attention to detail in the apartment was fantastic, plenty of hanging space in the wardrobe & the most comfortable of mattresses! We struggled getting up in the morning as we slept so well!!!<br/>The kitchen was very well equipped & had everything you needed. The bathroom was awesome especially the rain shower. The apartment was spacious & Internet was excellent. The location was perfect too, lots of history & added bonus staying on an island! Laura was on hand to answer any questions we had & offered lots of suggestions of places to eat & visit. The transfer from the airport & back was very helpful, stress free & comfortable. The breakfast was delicious & set us up perfect for our today!  My daughter is already planning her next visit to Laura & Arjan's. We would definitely stay again & have told friends & family of our perfect experience, thank you Laura & Arjan."
37519959,"Toetsie was very welcoming and her instructions on how to reach her home were spot on. Days before my journey she made sure I knew how to get there and was great at answering my questions. Her home was clean and the room was exactly as shown in the picture, more charming even. She was attentive to all my needs (in terms of heating and knowing where everything was). She was kind enough to let me borrow her transport card. Her cat is adorable and breakfast was lovely. I would definitely stay here again. "
37525575,"Our stay at Vondelpark House (room 1) was probably one of the best highlights of our honeymoon trip. The room was AMAZING! We loved the attention to detail, how it is beautifully decorated,  and the immaculate state of it overall. The room was spacious, very cozy and had one of the most comfortable beds we ever slept in. The toilet and bath was just as beautiful, well equipped with towels and toiletries. Location was excellent, situated in a neat residential neighborhood just a short walk to a tram stop. Just a few steps to Vondelpark too, which is a lovely place to stroll around in the morning. There are a few steps to climb to the second floor where the rooms are but it's all part of the Amsterdam experience (having some really steep steps)!<br/>Everything about our stay was even better than we expected and well worth the money. This is one of the few places where we actually felt sad to leave. <br/>What we loved the most was how Petra accommodated us like family and it made the experience even more valuable. We will definitely be back here when we return to Amsterdam! Maraming Salamat!<br/>PS: do we recommend staying at Vondelpark House? A resounding YES!! "
37540983,"Very nice, helpful and funny hosts! I felt very welcomed and had a great time here. They gave me useful clues and information.<br/>I slept well in the bed and it was very quiet.<br/>Great location, I rode the bike everywhere I needed to go and it really wasn't far. When I booked I was a little afraid it would be a little far from tourist attractions but it actually is very close by bike, even for lazy people like me ;) <br/> Also, this location will give you the chance to see shops and cafes where locals go.<br/>Washer and dryer work very well too.<br/>I would stay here again!"
37546440,Excellent host. Made us feel like really valued guests. Communication was very frequent and quick. Resalieke was accommodating to our special requests and made us feel at home. Highly recommended venue. Only minor drawbacks were that the TV did not work for us and that the shower area is semi open so the water can seep to other areas of the bathroom. The TV was not an issue for us as we were outside most of the time. And again the apartment overall was fantastic.
37596057,Merci Floris nous avons passé un très bon séjour à Amsterdam et notamment grâce à votre appartement familial très agréable.  Merci à Ana pour sa gentillesse et disponibilité.  <br/>Le séjour était trop court pour visiter votre joli ville mais nous reviendrons car vraiment nous avons tous été charmés petits et grands

37702533,"Wohnung für 3 Leute passt. Sehr angenehm eingerichtet. Hat alles was man braucht. Terrasse vorhanden, jedoch muss man über das Fenster steigen. Fernseher hat sogar Deutsche Sender. Die Wohnung ist beheizt. Das Bad und die Küche klein aber fein.<br/>Brigit hat einen sehr positiven Eindruck gemacht. Sie hat uns beim Check-In spätabends um 23:00 Uhr herzlich empfangen & alles gründlich gezeigt und sowie eingekauft fürs Frühstück.<br/>Die Lage ist grenzenlos Perfekt für Jemand der gerne in einer ruhigen Gegend und gleichzeitig nahe am Zentrum sein will. 5 Min zu Fuss bis zum Zentrum und den dutzenden Shopping-Möglichkeiten.<br/>Fazit: Amsterdam ist eine Stadt die man unbedingt erleben muss. Diese Wohnung dient perfekt dazu.<br/>Vielen Dank Brigit"
37722812,"To summarize, my family and I had a fantastic stay on Olaf &Mark's houseboat. After traveling through London and Paris over the holiday/new year, everything about their place was exactly what we needed. <br/>The location was perfect for us to explore the city while still being outside of the craziness of the town center. There were two very nice bars at just at the  end of the street. And there was the choice of either an organic or regular grocery just around the corner.  Public transport is also just at the corner, but we simply walked everywhere.<br/>The two rooms had queen size beds and were comfortable and surprisingly spacious. nice sized kitchen overlooking the dining table and the living space. The bathroom got a little cold and the toilet was a little high due to plumbing in a houseboat.  Although my legs dangled a bit, it was honestly more funny than an issue.<br/>Mark and Olaf were so accommodating. Before we arrived in Amsterdam, they connect with me through Whatsapp, and provided a great list of things we would need to know to get to the houseboat.  Mark picked up power converters for us when we first arrived since we didn't have any. During our stay, we had an issue with the door (I accidentally bent the key).  Mark was both understanding and helpful in fixing the issue.  <br/>As I stated earlier, my family and I had a great time on the houseboat. It was fun, relaxing, and an authentic experience. Although we didn't get to use the deck or chairs on the front of the boat due to the cold rainy weather, it just means we'll have to come back during the summer/spring. "
37752292,"Nous avons passé un très agréable séjour chez Joke et Gérard. Ils sont très prévenants, agréables et chaleureux. Gérard est même allé jusqu'à nous acheter des croissants le matin et nous a invité à faire un tour dans les canaux d'Amsterdam. Une très belle expérience! Joke et Gérard font des efforts pour parler français, car nous ne parlons pas très bien anglais...La house-boat est très lumineuse et fonctionnelle...et ce mode d'habitat est très original. 4 jours magnifiques. Un grand merci à tous les deux!"
37754253,"We had a lovely stay at Mike's apartment. The room was beautifully furnished and Mike really went the extra mile to make the stay enjoyable. For example, he let us keep our bags in the office after we'd checked out and he arranged cabs for us to leave for the airport. Great guy and a fantastic stay! "
37815700,"We werden zeer hartelijk ontvangen.  De kamer was perfect, schoon, voorzien van allerlei extra's (zoals Nespresso apparaat, handdoeken, doucheproducten, koelkast, ...), prachtige omgeving.  Maike en Caspar hadden ook een heerlijk ontbijtje voorzien voor ons, dat was een zeer aangename verrassing.  Vanuit de locatie is het centrum perfect bereikbaar.  Maike en Caspar hebben ervoor gezorgd dat onze eerste Airbnb ervaring een succes is geworden."
37822019,"Femke was the best! She was super accommodating as we were so many hours delayed. She even greated us with bread and cheese and delicious snacks. She left us with maps and told us how to get all around the city and where all the important things were. She even texted us to make sure we were doing okay. Her house was beautiful and the beds were so comfy. It's located right next to the tram and the bus, couldn't get better than that. Loved this place."
37823110,"Do you know the sensation of...surprise? That feeling hits us sometimes, tastes happiness... So I feel it with Laura & Arjan, I feel like at my own home since the time I arrived to Amsterdam.  I recommend it 100%. If you want to have this experience, then don't think anymore..., book it! My expectations has been exceeded. And that is my first time traveling through Airbnb. Excellent!"
37825537,"This is a beautiful, charming boat located in the very peaceful Westerdok. The surrounding area is beautiful, with a city farm and historic craft beer bar within 2 mins walk (try the Oud Kase at Westerdok bar - it comes on a guillotine!) The breakfast provided by Flip was more than enough to make sandwiches for lunch too, and he thoughtfully catered to our dietary needs. Bikes and canoe are provided free which is a huge bonus. We were foolish enough to leave our glasses behind but Flip messaged us before we even realised and will post them back. A fantastic host with a fantastic boat in a stunning location. We cannot recommend this highly enough! An ideal, tranquil retreat with great access to the city. There is a wonderful little terrace at the end of the garden looking out over the canal. Highly recommend "
37888873,"Das Apartment bei Lidia und Jean-Paul war großartig. Meine Familie war über das Wochenende dort und alle haben den Aufenthalt sehr genossen! Die Gastgeber waren auch sehr nett und hatten ein paar gute Tipps für die Umgebung.<br/><br/>Das Apartment ist sauber und ordentlich und vor allem großartig gelegen. Wenige Schritte in die eine Richtung und man ist im Vondelpark - Amsterdams grüne Lunge. Wenige Schritte in die andere Richtung und überall finden sich Cafés, Bars und Restaurants. Der Supermarkt Albert Heijn ist ebenfalls in der Straße und sogar Sonntags geöffnet.<br/>Von der Wohnung aus kann man mit der Straßenbahn (in 5min zu erreichen) direkt zum Hauptbahnhof ohne umzusteigen. Ein Fahrradverleih ist auch in der Nähe. Wer kein Fahrrad- oder Straßenbahfreund ist, kann die großen Museen aber trotzdem fußläufig innerhalb einer halben Stunde erreichen.<br/><br/>Insgesamt also sehr zu empfehlen."
37920331,We felt almost like home at the apartment. It fits perfectly to our requirements. The hosts were very friendly. Not to forget the service of breakfast with hot coffee and fresh orange juice. The location is also very central. 
37921911,"Marian and his husban were really kind and helpfull, they made our stay very pleasant. <br/>The area we had was very neatly decirated and the beds very confortable.<br/>The location was great for us, near the park and museums and away from the noise of the center. The transport by tram made very easy our movilization around the city and to the airport.<br/>Deffenetly a place ti stay!!!"
37973239,Nelleke's apartment was great for my family of 5. Having a kitchen and washer dryer made traveling with 3 children much easier. The neighborhood was nice and quiet and next door to a lovely park and close to trams and supermarkets. The rooftop terrace was amazing as were the many balconies off each room. Nellekes was available to text and ask questions and replied promptly. Only cons were lots of steep stairs and no lift but that is typical of Dutch homes.<br/>Would highly recommend for families!<br/>Tami
38015358,"The stay at Heins place was very nice! There is everything you need. With his nice bike you are in 7 minutes in the centre. There is a cinema, cafe and restaurant just one minute walk from the appartment. Hein is a very good guy. I like him, he is funny! Rent his appartment and you will enjoy amsterdam! Annes Apartment was great: clean, stylish, cozy! It was 10 min. from the Center and surrounded by authentic Cafes, Bars, Restaurants, Shops and Parks! Anne is very kind and fast responding, no AirBnB-Host before was this fast :D thank you!"
38043617,"Hans and Wendie were wonderful hosts. The space/room was incredible, and they have made sure they thought of everything to make my stay there as pleasant as possible. The room was large and relaxing, there was a senseo coffee machine, little basket of Dutch sweets and fruit, there were guide books on Amsterdam and even a pocket 'how to speak Dutch' book. The space was very clean, and the bath incredible! <br/>I honestly could not recommend this place enough. The location is fantastic - right among the shopping strip of  Liedersplein. Everything was accessible by walking (1.5km max to most sites), but if walking isn't your thing, then there was a tram right out front which took 10 mins to central station, less to the Dam square.<br/>Thanks for making my stay in Amsterdam so pleasant :)<br/> "
38055636,"Dear Arjan many thanks for your hospitality and moreover for the friendly relation you gave me , remember that in Italy and Swiss you have always a friend to count on .<br/>I want to inform all that I was in Amsterdam for my Job and  the house of Arjan was full of good energy .... maybe was not only the good willing of Arjan and his beautiful dog ... the fact is that I came back with a good contract signed .I guess that you cannot find a better place and a better Host for your stay in Amsterdam.<br/>Daniele"
38070754,"Die Unterkunft von Jeroen ist sehr gemütlich und so, wie in der Anzeige beschrieben. Es fehlt an nichts: Fernseher, wifi, großes Bett, Flipper.. man bleibt auch sehr gern mal zu Hause! In die Stadt kann man sehr gut das Fahrrad nehmen, was einem Jeroen leiht oder den Bus. Jeroen ist ein toller Gastgeber, der sehr bemüht ist und viele gute Ratschläge gibt, was man (auch in Amsterdam Nord) machen kann. Sehr empfehlenswert!"
38077105,"Wij zijn uiterst tevreden dat we Viola & Daniel hun appartement hebben mogen huren! Het was er zeer gezellig, proper en fris, door de vele lichtinval en het had een geweldig uitzicht over de buurt.<br/>Je zit er dicht aan het Haarlemmerplein, waarvan je met de bus en de tram op een wip aan het centraal station bent en van waaruit je heel A'dam kan exploreren (met tram&bus). Ook te voet biedt de Haarlemmerdijk en - straat een goede uitvalsbasis, ook ben je zo in de Jordaan of aan de grachten en zelfs de Dam is best te voet te doen. Wil je naar A'dam Noord: steek je met het pondje in de buurt gemakkelijk het IJ over.<br/>Check zeker het met gratis wifi voorziene Westerpark op 5 min. loopafstand, waar je in alle rust iets kan eten of drinken zonder over de vele toeristenkoppen te lopen :-) . <br/>Ook een dikke 'thumbs up' voor Viola en Daniel die je in woord en daad bijstaan.<br/>"
38081852,Everything was as on the pictures; beautful apartment and great location. Cozy room and the host was very helpful. Highly recommended
38159486,"Jeroen is a really hostility host when we stayed there. He is willing to give us many information about the sight seeing and recommendations about good restaurant to go; plus, the place is really convenience to down town (15-20 min by bus )and supermarket (5 min walk ), I will recommend you this place to stay if you are coming to Amsterdam ! "
38212157,"Clean, great location, great stay!!!! :)"
38237832,"Laura and Arjan were simply amazing. The location is in a quiet part of town and the apartment, although in the lower level, was immaculate, spacious, and awesome! I was traveling alone and they really went out of their way to make me feel comfortable. I'd go back in a heartbeat!<br/><br/>Also, the breakfast rocked.  "
38244495,"Marga,Rico and her family made me feel most welcome. They kindly collected me from the station and also dropped me off at the end of my stay. Their hospitality is second to none and I would not hesitate to recommend them. "
38263490,O local é simples e bem localizado. Anfitriões muito amigaveis e simpaticos.
38313731,"Gerrit hat uns freundlich empfangen, uns alles erklärt und einige gute Tipps gegeben. Seine Wohnung liegt im Erdgeschoß eines Hauses in einer ruhigen Seitenstraße. Sie ist geräumig und mit allem ausgestattet was man so braucht. Besonders gut hat uns der Garten im Hinterhof gefallen. Um ins Zentrum zu kommen, benützt man die Straßenbahn (Haltestelle ganz in der Nähe), oder die U-Bahn (etwas weiter entfernt). Der Stadtteil ist sehr belebt mit vielen Geschäften und Lokalen. Falls wir wieder einmal nach Amsterdam kommen, möchten wir auf jeden Fall wieder in Gerrits Wohnung wohnen. Recommended without reservation!"
38337479,"Very nice neighborhood. The apartment was very clean and spacious for two. Private bathroom with a wonderful shower.<br/><br/>Corina was a great host and provided us with whatever we needed. Also very noligable about the area and recommended great places to visit!"

38494186,"We had an amazig stay at Ellen's place! The room is really lovely, everything is new and there is plenty of space for two or even three persons. A bit off from the city centre but it is very easy to go there by public transport, there is good connection and the quiet neighbourhood will let you catch some good sleep. Ellen and Ron are simply amazing hosts, so helpful and always taking care about their guests. They even brought our luggage to the ferry station close to Amsterdam Centraal so that we could enjoy our last day in the city without carrying our bags with us since our train was not leaving until the evening. We hope to come back one day! "
38524852,"Monique and Roland were amazing hosts. The communication before and during the stay was extremely uncomplicated and friendly. However, and more importantly, the apartment is amazing and nicely decorated. Especially the free parking space in the garage is awesome considering the parking situation in Amsterdam. All in all, I defiantly recommend the apartment.  This place is amazing and something very special for Amsterdam. The boat is located directly in the heart of Amsterdam and Marie is the best host you can think of."
38544043,"The Kramer's Kramer is about all I could ask for. It was very cozy, with all the needed amenities available in a condensed, almost garage sized package.<br/>Hein was present and very welcoming, and was able to provide some very helpful insight into the surrounding area. I'd highly recommend the house to singles or couples who are looking to get out and around and see the city."
38555346,"I booked this trip as a birthday surprise for my boyfriend. Stunning flat and it is actually nicer than the pictures suggest and Viola & Daniel made us feel very welcome. I definitely wouldn't hestitate coming back here again. Had a lovely stay here, very clean and tidy. "
38559575,"as it said: it's a cozy room, with a little garden, where you can smoke. Gina is really nice, and she will prepare you breakfast(like a loving mama). It has been a really nice stay there.  We spend a weekend in amsterdam with a collegue and this place is in optimal distance from city centre."
38603658,"The apt is fantastic, clean, in a great location. It is off the beaten path in a good way. The hood is very nice, a little quieter with great cafes, restaurants, bars, etc. The busier center is easily accessible on foot (5-10 min walk). We had a great time. Mostly enjoyed the local restaurants but made one meal in the apt with ease. Wish we could have stayed longer. "
38641977,"Un appartamento PERFETTO...<br/>I proprietari gentilissimi anche se non c'erano è venuta una loro amica molto brava che ci ha dato indicazioni su come muoverci,il posto è abbastanza centrale con il tram sono poche fermate dal centro.Inoltre ci hanno fatto trovare dei cornetti delle uova latte e una bella bottiglia di vino rosso inoltre la casa dispone di 4 biciclette.<br/>CONSIGLIATO A TUTTI"
38678659,"El departamento de Mike es tal cual está descripto; está muy bien equipado (con cosas de buena calidad), tiene una cocina excelentemente preparada para cubrir todas las necesidades, la cama es grande y cómoda. El baño es chico, como él ya menciona en la descripción, pero el combo del departamento en general es más que excelente.<br/>La zona es muy bonita y pintoresca; la calle es tranquila y está enfrente de un muy lindo parque, y está a pocos minutos de caminata de la ""zona turística"" de Amsterdam (o para aquellos a los que no les gusta caminar, pueden encontrar una parada de tranvía muy cerca).<br/>Mike merece una mención aparte, es un host muy amable y atento; nos recibió y ayudó a subir mi valija por las escaleras, nos dio consejos y respondió dudas, y nos dejó como cortesía algunos alimentos para nuestra  estadía: café, frutas, bebida en la heladera, etc. Realmente está en detalles que hacen la estadía mas confortable. "
38693437,"I had such a beautiful time at Ellen 's. Her husband picked us up from the train station and welcomed us with maps, suggestions and the room was even more beautiful than the pictures. They weren't able to be home often but made sure there was someone home if we needed anything. They even wrote us a letter after a day to make sure we didn't need anything extra. SUPER hosts!!"
38698662,Original place to discover a beautifull town.<br/>Very nice welcome
38735961,"Frustrating stay. Owner was not there so was dealing with son in law who made it very difficult. Stated we could have an extra person stay for 50 euro but charged us 150 instead. Complained we were home late constantly when we were simply arriving home from being out. Had other people partying below us and told us we could stay and extra night and then revoked that when they had another booking online. No sheets or towels provided for the additional person we paid for and abused me when I woke them up at 10pm as I got locked out. Whilst it's a nice place to stay it was a one bedroom with 2 singles not 2 beds, and a fold out uncomfortable couch. This stay would have been better if we were dealing with the owner I believe. "
38764022,"Fantastic place and very warm hosts. The nature aground is stunning. Vito and Marina made me feel at home, took care of all my needs and even made me acupuncture and reiki. Very special people. Definitely recommended. The apartment is very nice. Chill, modern, clean and very pleasant to be in."
38866278,"Sally's listing description was accurate, but her pictures didn't really show how beautiful, new, and clean the flat is - it's gorgeous! She greeted us personally, showed us the flat and explained the house rules, and then spent 15-20 minutes talking to us and answering ALL of our questions. Her bakery, pub, pizza, and other restaurant recommendations were wonderful suggestions! She even had tram maps available for us to use. If we ever stay in Amsterdam again, we'll definitely be staying at Sally's flat again!"
38905696,"Joke looked after me from the moment I booked. I got very good directions from the airport and after taking the free ferry onto the north side, where Gerry picked me up. The room was very clean and I found it very peaceful, just watching the water flow. Both, Joke and Gerry, made me very welcome, gave me tips on what to do and even took me on a small canal tour. I had a fabulous time. Thank you."
38912655,"The flat was exactly as described. It was very quiet but still very close to the main touristic spots. And there wet also shops at 5 minutes walk to buy everything for a great breakfast (lidl, Eco supermarket and bakery). The kids found their rooms very welcoming and comfortable."
39000584,"A nice and cozy room in an amazing location in the center of Amsterdam. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Matthijs is a very helpful and friendly host. <br/>Breakfast at ""de laatste kruimel"" was lovely too! "

You have the felling to live like a real dutch! There are all what you need at 5min to the house(supermarket, boulangerie...). There are even a nice park at 2 minutes.

39115425,"I felt very comfortable and welcome in Enith's house. The apartment is very clean, cosy and spatious and I felt like at the  5 star hotel.Also there is a verry nice terrace on the roof. The neighbourhood is quiet and located in a green area, very easy to reach from the tram station.  Enith is such a wonderful person and her positive energy you can feel inside her house. My friend and I - had an amazig  'U2 Innocence &Experience' time and citybreak in Amsterdam! Thank you Enith, my warm wishes from Transilvania!"
39143850,Great experience. Very hospitable hosts - even picked me up at the station and dropped me off at work. Couldn't ask for more. Room as advertised. 
39146032,"Wir hatten 4 tolle Tage! Amsterdam, Haarlem und der Strand sind von hier aus gut zu erreichen. Im Haus ist alles was man braucht und das Frühstück wär immer ausreichend und frisch. Man sollte für dieses Haus ein Naturfreund sein und spinnen und Wespen nicht scheuen. Dusche und WC befinden sich auf den Zimmern! Die vier Räume sind alle sehr schön. Die Gastgeber waren sehr nett und jederzeit erreichbar. Um die Ecke befindet sich ein toller Badesee. Wir kommen gerne wieder."

39266515,"The room was nice and spacious, 5 mins walk from the train station, at the beginning of the Red Light District (RLD). Although the RLD is a lively neighborhood, it's pretty safe and the room is located in a very quiet area. It has a mini fridge that comes in handy, some cutlery, glasses, a kettle and some basic stuff so you can prepare your own breakfast/snack (a toaster would have been nice though). The place was clean enough and the bed was very comfortable. Shower wasn't separated from the rest of the bathroom but finally it wasn't as messy as we thought at first. We didn't have the pleasure to meet David but he was always available by email. <br/>On the other hand, even though it was a quiet street, the building itself was kind of noisy. There were kids living upstairs, playing and doing what children should do, but if you're sensitive to noise maybe you should re-consider booking this place. Also, daily cleaning was not included. "
39270163,"Joke es un ángel! Las atenciones, disposición, amabilidad y calidez hizo que nos sintieramos como en casa. El lugar estaba muy agusto, aunque el baño era compartido, todo estuvo muy limpio y agradable.

Non abbiamo incontrato Nathalie ma abbiamo comunicato con lei e ha sempre risposto velocemente e con precisione, dandoci molti utili consigli. La splendida terrazza assicura momenti di relax. Attenzione per chi ha bimbi piccoli o difficoltà di spostamento perché le scale interne sono molto ripide. Grazie Nathalie per l'ottima ospitalità. Federica"

39581392,"Me and my boyfriend had a wonderful long weekend staying in Remco's apartment! We felt that very need was catered for and more so. The bathroom upstairs was luxurious and well stocked with towels, toiletries and lavish furnishings. We also loved the unique layout, n which the bedroom and bathroom is only separated by a wall for the bed to rest against in the centre of the room- very modern and comfortable.<br/>the bed itself was very comfortable and lovely to cuddle up in, very warm too. Good quality bedding. The view was very cute onto the canal and surroundings.<br/>The location was easily walk-able from the centre, a good 20 minute walk if you are strolling and looking in shops. Very close to several trams and cafes. <br/>Kitchen also well stocked- small balcony very sweet, if it  had not been so cold we would've used it more often.<br/>We were met by Remco's friends Friedrich and Bernard who were very friendly ans gave us lots of helpful tips on the apartment, the location and sights to see.<br/>Would definitely recommend this place for a couple or a solo traveller, and we would definitely stay again.<br/>Thank you Remco!"

Tengo que agradecer profundamente a SHAI y Maria ya que KLM olvido entegarnos una valija y ellos llamaron y se preocuparon para que en menos de 24 hs. la misma volviera con nosotros. Sin celular europeo y sin conocer el idioma, esa ayuda fue mas importante que cualquier otra cosa.  Son un gran equipo !<br/>El resto: ubicacion, departamento- limpieza, medios de locomocion, seguridad, cercania en supermercado y bares-restaurantes, excelente. Gracias/<br/>"
39694759,"Martine est une hôte sympathique et chaleureuse. Elle parle parfaitement le français, nous fait sentir rapidement à l'aise et nous laisse fonctionner en toute indépendance durant le séjour. Le quartier où se trouve sa maison, bien qu'un peu excentré, est calme et agréable et les lieux de vie (chambre et salle de bain) sont propres et fonctionnels. Dans l'ensemble notre expérience amstellodamoise chez Martine fut très agréable et je recommande cet aibnb. <br/>"

39921792,"I was staying in Amsterdam for my brothers birthday and therefore was looking up an apartment that was as close as possible to the city centre.<br/>Raul's place ticks all of the boxes. It is no more than 10 mins walk from the central train station, while 10-15mins to walk to the city centre. The surrounding amenities to the property include; supermarkets, juice bars, deli (head to Vinnies Deli just 2mins away), a selection of very good coffee shops (Barney's is around the corner) as well as a small playground including a basketball court. To top it off, just outside the property is a canal. Further up the road you can watch boats pass through the canal, by sitting on the nearby pier - perfect for some canal gazing in the evening!<br/>In addition, the flat itself is clean and tidy and looks great! Raul was kind enough to get us breakfast on the first day, after which with Raul living just above he was never to far when we needed him.<br/>All in all, I would highly recommend this flat!"

Toetsie was more than welcoming, we even received a bottle of wine and juice, together with towels, soap, and a breakfast that was big enough for 2 mornings! Communication was easy and fast. The house is great, with a real Amsterdam-feel to it. We had the whole floor to ourselves, as there was no one in the other room at the time. The bed is very comfy, the neighborhood is cool and safe, and you can easily walk into town. Toetsie is lovely and so is her cat Roky! We would definitely recommend this place to anyone!

40933711,"A wonderful place to be: an exceptional host with exquisite taste that turned a short stay into a great one. <br/>Its a great location to stay: quiet enough if you need to rest and it's 10m walk to major museums.<br/>Great dutch amenities!!!"
40951688,"We really enjoyed our stay. Caroline made us feel welcome. The arrangements for picking up the keys was tailored to our requirements. The accommodation felt like a welcoming home. The accommodation was of a high standard. Caroline kept us informed and was keen to ensure we enjoyed our stay. The location is good. It is easy to access public transport into the canal area of Amsterdam and near to Vondelpark.<br/>We would recommend others to enjoy this accommodation."
40978571,"We loved Mike's flat, it was bright and spacious, and a lovely place to spend time. It was full of everything we needed - coffee machine, pots and pans and tea, water and juice, fantastic! <br/>Gorgeous area, just opposite the park and very close to a number of restaurants and the Albert Cuypstraat market.<br/>We would definitely come back!"
41022869,"Toetsie was a perfect host, very friendly and helpful. The coffee was delicious. Her house has unique decor. It was a pleasure staying there. Highly recommended. "
41070609,"We had a lovely trip to Amsterdam, first time using Airbnb. Couldn't have been happier with the experience, especially how flexible and friendly our host was!"
41140395,"Amazing place to stay and in a very convenient location. Very lovely and private room with a wonderful restroom. Laura's breakfast was delicious and an extremely wonderful way to start the day. She was also very kind, helpful and fun. Staying here was an integral and unforgettable part of our Amsterdam experience. Do yourself a favor and stay here! 10/10"
41141860,"This really is a lovely apartment in a lovely area, we thought we had struck gold (we will be making fairly frequent trips to Amsterdam and thought we has found a great base).... BUT...<br/><br/>They advertise 'an entire apartment' but if you read it carefully the owner can come back at an any point and use the spare room (and I assume the bathroom and kitchen), which we weren't aware of. So this is NOT an entire apartment (the host showed us into the spare room).<br/><br/>And this is what happened to us... at 2am (with no warning). The owner snuck back into the spare room where our 4 month old was sleeping, we were woken and thought it was an intruder (or worse). <br/>This was honestly the scariest moment of our lives when you realise a stranger has snuck into your sleeping baby's room in the middle of the night.<br/><br/>Long story short - we challenged him, it took us 30 mins of arguing for him to convince us he was the owner (who had come back for his tennis kit!!!! At 2am!!!!). As a martial arts instructor, this could've ended up very differently.<br/><br/>I do think this was accidental and a one-off, but it's hard to recommend this after such an experience."
41158279,Very nice/ funny & comfortable B&B! Excellent to have a cold beer waiting for us and Olaf showed us the perfect place to drink it: his rooftop terrace. This b&b has not only a comfy bed but also a hospitable host who gave us lost of tips for restaurants and taxi to the AirPort. It's a bit of a mixture of like sleeping in your old room at your parents house and sleeping in a comicbookmuseum. Perfect for 2 couples travelling together and visiting Amsterdam for a day or three. Oh and by the way: it's located in the most friendly area of Amsterdam. Thumbs up!
41191398,"Fantastic location and view of the canals. The room was comfortable, had a bathroom connected, and had coffee and tea available. Would recommend!"
41308306,"Les photos sont un peu trompeuses...<br/>L'annonce n'est pas assez claire...<br/>Nous pensions être seuls dans l'appart...le propriétaire vit là, une personne dormait sur le sopha le premier matin...pas accés au salon...<br/>La chambre est vraiment trop petite pour deux lits, trois personnes..."
41378400,"Laura and Arjan were incredible hosts! They picked us up from the airport and got us checked really quick.  The breakfast was a wonderful start to the day and the apartment was everything you could ask for; clean, good location, comfortable, etc.<br/>We loved having how quiet the area was around the apartment, but within just a few minutes walk from the downtown area.  We couldn't have been happier with our stay and we can't wait for a chance to come stay here again!"
41400235,"Edith was very helpful in describing the neighborhood and the best way to get to the room, which truly is in the heart of Amsterdam. She was very attentive and welcoming which was especially nice because it was our first visit to Amsterdam. Edith provides a (multilingual) folder full of useful information about attractions and travel. The breakfast was a divine array of fruits, breads, egg, cheeses and meats which catered for my vegetarian preference too. The room is exactly as photographed: spotless, warm and quiet with a lovely canal view - although be mindful that there are steep stairs up to the room. Everywhere is within walking distance - be sure to visit the Cheese Museum opposite the Anne Frank House and take a cruise down the canal in the evening to really appreciate the historic atmosphere of Amsterdam. Myself and my boyfriend had a wonderful birthday trip and cannot wait to return as there is so much to do. Edith, and her wonderful room,   really made the trip all the better. Do not hesitate to stay here!"
41466815,"Marc and his family are really welcoming. They gave us a lot of useful tips, where to go and what to see the city. "
41535699,"I've stayed in several airbnbs and Christopher was definitely the best host ever!<br/>He was very attentive and thoughtful. Got everything well-prepared and took good care of his house. He's a person who loves to share. We've had interesting conversations and he did his best to show me around and give me good advices (like a festival which local people will go, instead of tourist trap). I felt like I was staying at a good friend's house and I really love it!<br/>As to the apartment. It was exactly as  description. Spacious, comfy, well-equipped, has many big windows from which sunlight could come in. It's pretty easy to go to city center by public transportation, however I highly recommend to take a good walk from and to Chris' house. :)<br/>Amsterdam itself is amazing, but Chris just made my stay perfect!!!"
41538081,"We are still considering to report Sheryl and Lucasz to Airbnb. <br/><br/>Why? <br/><br/>We are a family of 3, mom, dad and our 2-year old daughter and booked the apartment for a weekend. We paid in advance, received the confirmation and Sheryl told us where to find the key. Upon arrival on Friday night, there was no key. Sheryl’s phone was off and also no response to our e-mails. We had to spontaneously find and book on short notice a hotel in Amsterdam on a Friday night. You can imagine how pleasant this is with a 2 year old in the car at night. Not to speak of the prices.<br/><br/>It took Sheryl until Saturday morning (09h44) to contact us. She reassured us that she would leave the key in course of the day (this time for real) at a restaurant close by the apartment and let us know. <br/><br/>At 16h16, we had still not heard from her and contacted her again to check whether the key is now at the restaurant. She confirmed to us that the key would be there. We drove to the said restaurant, where we were told that there is no key. After calling Sheryl again, Lucasz in a very aggressive tone rebutted that the key would not be there and insisted that it is at the restaurant. <br/><br/>It took three more phone calls with Lucasz until he admitted that the key was “delayed” and someone is now for sure on his way to deliver the key to the restaurant.<br/><br/>Once we finally had the key and entered the apartment, we had to realize that it was not properly cleaned. I spare you the details but e.g. the fridge was partly filled with open/ old groceries including two bottles of spoiled milk.<br/><br/>Sheryl did apologize and transferred the money back that she had received for the booking. <br/><br/>I would caution to book this apartment if you travel with small kids and need certainty around your accommodation."
41542254,"Wer eine Luxusunterkunft erwartet ist hier sicher falsch! Dennoch war es für uns die perfekte Unterkunft und wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt. Miram hat uns persönlich in Empfang genommen und alles gezeigt. Sie hat auch angeboten, dass sie rund um die Uhr erreichbar für uns ist.<br/>Das Bad ist wirklich klein, das Spühlbecken dient gleichzeitig als Waschbecken und die Kochmöglichkeiten sind begrenzt. <br/>ABER: Der Parkplatz ist sprichwörtlich vor der Haustür und das Studio bietet reichlich Platz um sich breit zu machen. In der Umgebung gibt es alles, was man zum Leben braucht: Supermarkt, Geldautomaten, Imbissläden und Restaurants. Die Lage ist ruhig und dennoch ist man mit der Tram schnell in der Innenstadt.<br/>Gleich ums Eck sind das Mojo mit Burgern, Sparribs etc. sowie das La Vallade, in dem man für 35 Euro das 5 Gänge-Menue des Tages bekommt - wir fanden es super.<br/>Alles in allem haben wir uns sehr wohl dort gefühlt! Vielen Dank nochmal an Miriam!!"
41564029,"We spent 3 days in Christopher's place and everything was perfect!<br/>He was so welcoming and helpful. He gave us so many good advices and we felt like home. <br/>We took time to talk to each over : he is open-minded and he took care to speak an English easy to understand! :-)<br/>His appartment is definitely charming and light. <br/>By tram, Amsterdam is pretty close and it's possible to come back home by feet too ;-)<br/>From the airport, you only need 30 minutes by train and there are direct trains : so easy!<br/>If we go back to Amsterdam, we will contact him for sure!<br/>Thank again Christopher"
41570026,"La chambre est conforme aux photos, agréable et joliment décorée.<br/>Elle est à l'étage au dessus de l'appartement des propriétaires, assez indépendante. <br/>Si vous avez du mal à dormir avec de la lumière, penser à prendre un masque, car la chambre est lumineuse et les rideaux peu occultants.<br/><br/>Elle se situe dans un quartier calme, dans une rue agréable, à environ 15 minutes du centre en transports ou à vélo.<br/>L'accueil est très bon.

41603662,Karin hat uns sehr herzlich empfangen und geholfen uns in Amsterdam zurechtzufinden. Das Hausboot ist gut eingerichtet und sehr sauber. Die Umgebung ist angenehm und ruhig. Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt. Gerne kommen wir ein andermal wieder.
41614107,"It was our first time using airbnb and we couldn't have hoped for a better host. Olaf was hospitable yet unintrusive. The location of the apartment is great, just a 5 minute walk from the Albert Cuyp Markt. The bedrooms are spacious and comfortable. Only downside I could think of is the sharing of one bathroom by four people but if you're out sightseeing all day it shouldn't be a problem."
41683065,"Super Lage - sehr einfach zu finden.<br/>Wir haben ein Fahrrad für die 3 Tage gemietet und waren so sehr schnell im Zentrum. Das Boot fährt alle paar Minuten - somit beste Verbindung zur City. <br/>In der Nähe von der Wohnung gibt es diverse Bars, Restaurants,... usw.<br/>Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt. Die Einrichtung war nicht dieselbe wie auf den Fotos - aber das hat uns nicht gestört.<br/><br/>"
41691529,Petra's house was just perfect. Lovely style and very very clean. Got everything I need there. Wonderful location. Close to beautiful Vondelpark and a walking distance to Van Gogh museum. Easy to city centre and airport by public transportation both. Strongly recommended!
41744877,"If you get the chance to stay here, do it! Reinout was the perfect host. He had suggestions for what to see and where to eat. Breakfast is included every morning and is wonderful. The top floor space is huge by European standards and has an ensuit. I peeked in the other room and even though it doesn't have an attached bathroom, is large and light and bright! If we make it back to Amsterdam, we would gladly stay here again. Thank you for your hospitality, Reinout!"
41747543,"Unsere Zeit in Amsterdam war toll. Laura und ihr Mann haben uns den Aufenthalt sehr angenehm gemacht. Sie sind sehr zuvorkommend und haben mit einem Frühstück den Start in den Tag perfekt gemacht. Das Appartement ist super ausgestattet und sehr sauber.

Everything there is as it should be, the whole in 1049 Prinsengratch is friendly and cosy.<br/>We've largely appreciated the private access and facilities.<br/>The room is ideally located close to all Amsterdam mayor hot spots: in few minutes of cycling is possible to reach the Museums district, Dam square or Centraal Station.<br/>We do really recommend Canal View Prinsengracht. <br/>Stefano e Rosangela"
41835808,"La maison d'Amos était idéale pour accueillir notre famille composée de 2 adultes et de 2 adolescents. Depuis le penthouse, vue dégagée sur les toits. Beaucoup d'espace, beaucoup de lumière, décoration chaleureuse et beaucoup de générosité dans l'accueil et la mise à disposition des commodités de la maison. Une façade donne sur une rue calme et l'autre sur l'espace vert d'un îlot d'habitation. Le quartier fin 19ème, est totalement safe et les liaisons en tram avec le centre sont directes et rapides. Des magasins, supermarché et marchés en plein air à proximité. Amos a été  très prévenant et à notre écoute. Nous n'hésiterons pas à y retourner lors d'un prochain séjour. "
41838857,Communications clear and precise and timely. Directions were accurate. I walked from Amsterdam Central in 45 minutes.<br/>Marga was very sociable and helpful.<br/>The accomodation was exactly as described. It suited my needs and tastes perfectly. The bed was very comfortable and the room very cosy even in the morning when the logburner had gone cool.<br/>Breakfasting at the big table in the houseboat kitchen living room was a delight as I was observed by the Ducks and Swans through the water level windows.<br/>Yes I would come again!<br/>Thanks very much Marga and Family it was a real pleasure to meet you.
41852664,"Our journey to Amaterdam in Reinas apartment was really great.

42001549,Mike was very welcoming. The flat was very clean and comfortable. Everything as shown in the pictures. No surprises! We will come back! 
42032616,"Toetsie is a warm and open soul and is very helpful.  The rooms are small, but I found the place great to spend time in and recharge when I needed to.  The location is great because it is on a quiet street, but there are amenities like grocery stores, pharmacies, restaurants and cafes very close while only being a short bike ride from anywhere in centrum.  Plus, the Oosterpark area is a very cool off-the-radar neighborhood and worth exploration.  An added bonus is the close proximity to Muilderpoort train station.  You can skip the very busy Centraal Station going to and from Shipol.  "
42035654,"Perfect location, love De Pjip and lovely apartment with large comfy bed and lots of extra touches e.g. Fluffy towels, toiletries, water, juice and fruit in fridge on arrival.

42045373,"Agradable estancia, habitación muy acogedora con una ubicación excelente, David nos atendió muy bien, llegamos antes de hora y no tuvo problemas en darnos la habitación, lo recomiendo al 100%. En próximas visitas que haga a Amsterdam sin duda elegiré esta habitación."
42093631,"I booked on a very short notice a room for a single night (the day before my actual travel). Marga answered me immediately. I told her my arrival times and she proposed to get me at a station about 10 minutes travel with the car. That was really great, also taking into consideration that my arrival was later than planned.  Marta and her family are very easygoing and you feel welcome. The little house where I slept is very cute and cosy. I had no problem that the bathroom was in the main house, a charming self-designed boats house by Marga’s husband Rico. That gave me the occasion to visit the house and to say hello to the family, with whom I had breakfast the next morning. The neighborhood is calm and you have the impression to be at the countryside. With the bike which you can rent you are in about 20 minutes in the center, biking next to the Amstel. I had a great time in my 1.5 days where I travelled alone,  and I am happy that I met Marga and her family. I hope that I have the opportunity to come back to visit them again. "
42115620,"We arrived around midday, Nortje (Jeroens girlfriend) welcomed us and showed us around. She gave us really good informations about the area and where we should go. She gave us maps and answered all our questions.  The room is really nice, cozy, clean and big. We felt at home immediately.  There is a pinball machine in the room which is a lot of fun. We were sharing the bathroom and the entrance with some other people. Unfortunately there is no lock for the room, which would be nice to have, because of the roomates. The supermarket is really close and also the bus station is only a two minutes walk. Jeroen and Nortje prepared two bikes for us, which was absolutely great. They were old but did their job. We also met Jeroen and had a good talk. He was really friendly and asked if we were feeling fine. <br/>Thanks for everything!! We loved it at your place,<br/>we definitely recommend to stay at Jeroen´s.<br/>greets"

42188201,"We had an awesome stay- not only the home was as picture perfect as you see it, but our hostess was all that we could have hoped for and more- Petra was kind enough to answer all our questions and made us feel very welcome and completely at home.<br/><br/>The location is next to the beautiful Vondelpark and one can conveniently hop on the Metro to get to City Centre in 15-20 mins, <br/>"

I don't think I could have found a more perfect place for a solo trip to Amsterdam.  I recommend to anyone traveling, especially any other ladies traveling solo.  You will feel welcome and safe."
42308706,"Host was welcoming and helpful, showed us which trams to take, etc.  Interior of houseboat was very nice, clean, modern.  Shower was great, bed was comfy.  Our only issue was the amount of spiders and spiderwebs everywhere.  While we only found one medium, brown spider in our room during our stay, there were many outside.  We continually had to sweep them away from seats, gangplank, door.  This might not be a problem for everyone, but I'm phobic about spiders and had a very difficult time staying here.  I stuck it out, but would not have booked had I known it was ""spider season,"" as our host called it when we arrived."

42340910,"Willem and spike were amazing hosts. Not only are we allowed to leave our luggages at the apt (we arrived at 8 am), but they kindly let us refresh ourselves in their facilities since our room was not ready till a little later. This was really helpful after a 13 hour flight :) the apt itself is truly beautiful with the most picturesque window view of the canal and tree lined streets, with a nice park just beside it. They thought of little details like a nespresso machine, wine, heated bathroom floors and towel warmer that makes this a truly enjoyable stay. "
42351226,"Fenno's place was perfect for my girlfriend and I's city break to Amsterdam. Great location - felt very safe at all times of day/night. The bus stop at Fennos is 1 minute away, and the bus service runs every 10 minutes until midnight to Amsterdam Central. And a Tram stop only a 5 minute walk away. <br/><br/>Fenno greeted us at the bus stop, introduced us to the neighbourhood, the accommodation (e.g, any house rules - all as expected), and his own tips for what to see in Amsterdam. He was also flexible with our check in/out times which was a big help to us!<br/><br/>The accommodation was cosy and romantic.

42440247,"The apartment was as pictured. Clean, spacious, near to train station. Mathilde provided tea, coffee, waffle biscuits, jam... And the kitchen was complete for cooking.<br/><br/>Unfortunately we arrived on a very cold and rainy night and the radiators did not work! Only the bathroom radiator heated up, so the bedroom was very cold. My son caught a cold and the heaters were only on for half the time in the 4 days we were there. Even though we had the whole apartment, we could not control the heating (or lack of it). We ended up being unable to visit much of amsterdam.<br/><br/>As we were travelling for 2 weeks, we had large suitcases, unfortunately there was no mention that the staircase up to the second floor apartment was a mini spiral staircase. <br/><br/>The bed was as pictured but we were not used to the type of mattress which is not firm, instead it was very soft and gave us backpains.<br/><br/>All in all not a good experience, half due to weather, half due to the heating and bed."
42446316,"Apartment compatible with the offer - exactly the same on the pictures and the description. Great location - very close to the center. Daniel & Viola were in good touch when you book your room and stay. It was a very good rest. We recommend 100%.<br/><br/>Monika & Marcin "
42488559,"We had a great time at David's place. He was wonderful about communicating with us and the room was large, clean and very attractive.

Edwin is the only one refuse to help me with my 22 inch luggage.  He said he cannot wet himself while letting me staying in the rain and he said he is not suppose to help. I almost called airbnb Bc I cannot reach my room. His attitude was really bad. When I left, I asked the guy in the room next to mine to make my luggage to the door. Apt is extremely old. This is the only unpleasant stay I had with airbnb. "

42681614,"The communication with Nancy was fine. A little more information about how to get there, like which station we had to get off, would have been good. It was also kingsday, when we arrived, which we didn't know and the metro didn't stop where we had to get off, that caused an exhausting start. But when we arrived, Nancy's mother welcomed us and was really nice. She showed us around and answered all of our questions. The apartment was really nice, but we had trouble figuring out how the shower worked, because there are maaany buttons, a manual would have been a big help, also the plug from the bathtub was broken and wouldn't come off. After calling Nancy's mom we got it worked out, but that cost us some time and nerves on our first morning. Other than that our stay at Nancy's apartment was great!"
42684064,"Fabulous house and relaxed easy going hosts. Our children loved it, especialy the firemans pole and cowboy bedroom.  Great location, lovely views. <br/>Also a big thanks to the hosts baby sitter Kris. Our daughter had lots of fun with her. <br/>Hope we can visit again. "
42695238,"Très joli appartement, accès très facile au centre ville à l'aide des bus et à 15 minutes à vélo du centre ville.<br/>Le quartier est calme. <br/><br/>L'appartement en lui même est très douillet, avec un énorme canapé, idéal pour flaner.<br/><br/>Bronte nous a mis à disposition une liste de commerces, restaurants et services divers, a été très accueillante."
42712504,It was a perfect week in Amsterdam at Toetsie 's home. I felt very welcome. Esspecially the rooftop with its beautiful look over the houses. Toetsie gave me a bike and so visit the City of old Amsterdam was a Shorts ride of 15 minutes.  A Yoga Studio is just around the corner. If you like cats its very comfortable. I enjoyed  it very much! Die Unterkunft ist gut gelegen. In 20 min zu Fuß kann man alles erreichen und die Stadt erkunden. Olof ist ein super freundlicher und schneller Gastgeber!
42773459,We had a wonderful weekend staying with Joke & Gerard.  Their houseboat is beautiful and perfectly located for a city break.  Joke and Gerards' hosting skills are suburb and after a being collected from the ferry point we were warmly welcomed into their home and shown our delightful room and the facilities.  They are a friendly couple who are full of local knowledge which they are only too happy to share should you need any touristy assistance.  Breakfast was plentiful and fresh and more then enough to set us up for the day.  We were lucky that the weather was stunning so we had breakfast served outside on the deck - such a treat!  We were also lucky enough to be treated to a tour of the canals with Gerard on their motorboat!  All in all an absolutely delightful property in a perfect area with hosts who helped make our stay exactly what we wanted!
42778298,"Perfect flat well situated to visit Amsterdam. Good connexion with the city center.<br/><br/>Thank you very much Bronte for you nice flat and your advises. <br/><br/>Best regards"
42799734,"We had an amazing weekend in the lovely appartment of Hein. We definitely recommend it ! <br/>"
42817390,"the room was very big, so if you are a bigger group of people and someone is fine with sleeping on the floor i guess it would also be a good option. everything worked out perfectly, we just had problems with the bicycles which were not really functioning. however, jeroen gave us back our money without any problems.<br/>jeroen explained all the area and places to us and he actually also spoke german very well!<br/>the only little inconvenience for me was the mirror which was too high up, i couldn't really see myself in it as i am really small. would be nice to have another mirror somewhere."
42823645,Had a fun and eventful stay at Edwin's place. He's a helpful host and a wonderful human being! 
42831845,"Loved  Amsterdam. Naomi's studio was my first Airbnb experience and it was perfect. Check in smooth and the studio although small is immaculate, beautifully decorated and felt like a boutique hotel room. The area is lovely and it was super easy to get everywhere. We hired bikes from Otto Bikes on Overtoom. Just a 5 min walk away for 10 euros a day. The local bar was a bit noisy but with the windows closed it didn't bother us, and it was never noisy later than midnight. <br/>I think the price was good though you can probably get a bigger place for a bit less if that's important to you. Would definitely use the place again. "
42853190,"Gina nous a accueillistrès chaleureusement. L appartement etait tres bien, la chambre tres propre, le petit dejeuner tres copieux et le quartier etait tres sympa et pratique cote transport en commu . Bref tout etait tres bien!"
42885696,"Lovely. Good location in Amsterdam, not too far from the centre. The flat is great, gives you everything you need, a home away from home."
42888911,Amsterdam er nýja uppáhalds borgin mín og Petra  sá til þess m.a. mælti hún með góðum veitingastað sem við borðuðum tvisvar á.  Virkilega fínt herbergi og öll aðstaða til fyrirmyndar.  Go Petra!
42893686,Lugar muy acogedor y anfitrión simpático y muy agradable
42922089,Die Unterkunft bei Joke und Gerhard hat unseren Amsterdambesuch zu etwas besonderem gemacht. Wir wurden herzlich Willkommen geheißen und fanden das Zimmer gemütlich und sauber vor. Der Blick aufs Wasser ist natürlich ein Highlight. Joke und Gerhard waren tolle Gastgeber. Das Hausboot ist von der Innenstadt gut zu erreichen. Auch Nachts fahren genügend Fähren und Busse. Wir können dieses Zimmer nur wärmstens empfehlen!
42930317,"My two friends and I stayed in this apartment for three days and two nights. What an excellent experience! Bronte is very hospitable, leaving information about the neighborhood and greater Amsterdam for us. I think it has been mentioned, but do be wary if you are allergic to cats that a cat has been in this apartment. I would rate this entire experience a 10/10!"
42935408,"Très bon séjour chez Maike, très accueillante, l'appartement est impeccable et très charmant. La vue est magnifique, à une dizaine de minutes de l'hyper centre en velo. Je recommande ! "
42973579,"L'accoglienza da parte di Gabriella e Jonh è stata incredibile, due persone squisite gentili buone e sempre disponibili. durante il nostro soggiorno ci siamo sentiti a casa, sembrava di essere in famiglia clima caldo e accogliente ma soprattutto familiare. Hanno addirittura cucinato per noi e mangiato con noi, mentre si conversava, come un famiglia. La casa è stupenda da 4 stelle ed 15 minuti dal centro. La consiglio a tutti ,aumenta in positivo la visita della città.<br/>Gabriella and jonh are amazing, they are cute, kind and ever avaiable for everythings. they help us in all things, information food place club etc.. the house is fantastic, it is more luxury and more confortable, near the centre only 15 minutes in a good street. They are cooked for us( and drink good wine) the dinner, and we ate togheter the breakfast. I suffer this flat for anyone, it's a great experience."
42986449,"Everything was perfect !!!<br/>It was a very spontaneous trip to amsterdam, but you and your friendly Room with the lovely garden made it to a beautify weekend for us!!!<br/>Thanks for all!"
42997004,"Merci pour cette étape qui me change des hôtels aseptisés ! Il s'agissait de ma première réservation airbnb. Si tous les propriétaires sont aussi accueillants, aimables, serviables et disponibles que Laura et son mari alors, j'arrête de dormir à l’hôtel ! Merci et peut être à l'année prochaine."
43014922,"Das Apartment ist wirklich super. Es liegt etwa 450 Meter von einer Tram-Station entfernt, die direkt zum Hauptbahnhof durchfährt. Auf Grund der schwierigen Parkmöglichkeiten lohnt sich eine Anreise mit dem Zug.<br/>In der Wohnung war alles vorhanden: Gasherd, Kühlschrank, Spülmaschine,... Sogar Trockentücher, Bettwäsche, Handtücher, Shampoo und Haarfön wurden gestellt, sodass wir wenig von Zuhause mitbringen mussten. Paul ist ein super Gastgeber. Im Kühlschrank gab es ein Willkommensgetränk und sogar die Koffer hat er uns hochgetragen. Einziger Nachteil: Der Zugang zur Wohnung führt über eine wirklich sehr sehr steile Treppe. Ist gewöhnungsbedürftig - aber in Ordnung, solange man vorsichtig hinabsteigt.<br/>Wir hatten einen tollen Kurzurlaub in Amsterdam"
43021397,"Très bon accueil de la part de Daan.<br/>Très disponible pour nous conseiller avant notre arrivée (tram, bus,..)<br/>Un beau panier de fruits et qques petits provisions laissés pour nous dans frigo et dans armoire.<br/>Daan est d'une grande souplesse par rapport à nos heures d'arrivée et de sortie. Nous avons quitté l'appartement l'après-midi et c'était OK pour lui.<br/>Merci Daan !"
43055453,"Clean and very organized studio apartment in the heart of the downtown of Amsterdam. David was very nice and helpful and allowed us to store our suitcases before time.  The apartment had a cooler, gas heating, a small TV, water heater for coffee/tea, really nice shower, and a view of the canal. "
43065724,"It was a beautiful sized, clean and well kept studio apartment in a great location in Amsterdam on a street full of nice little restaurants."
43099567,"Everything is good except the WiFi connection. I don't understand how a double room can only have a single access to the WiFi. Even in public place, we can easily get access to any free WiFi connection. It was so inconvenient for travelers. If you need an extra quota for the WiFi connection, you have to pay for that. But all in all, all the other things was fine. The location is great. Breakfast is included which is quite a good point for us."
43099840,Everything was great! Especially the luxury shower and the delicious Turkish breakfast across the street!
43133500,"Fui muito bem recebida  e o quarto correspondeu exactamente ao que estava ilustrado nas fotos. Adorei o local perto do rio, muito sossegado mas perto do centro, de bicicleta cheguei rapidamente  aos locais mais turísticos. Recomendo para quem quer conhecer um outro lado de Amsterdão. Fiquei uma noite em casa da Maike e do Gaspar. Fui bem recebida pela Maike, foi uma estadia muito rápida, mas no quarto estava tudo muito bem preparado e organizado. O bairro é muito bom, tranquilo,  perto de lojas e restaurantes. Ideal para quem não quer ficar no centro turístico de Amsterdão mas, quer ficar perto, num bairro moderno e com vida. Obrigado Maike"
43190451,Very nice location at centrum. High privacy in B&B style. Very suitable for two :) 
43193319,"Staying at David's place was perfect. The appartement was central, right in the middle of the city. You can find everything you would need in a few minutes. <br/>The room and the toilet were very clean and comfortable. If I ever go back to Amsterdam I would like to stay there again.<br/>I absolutely recommend this place!"
43198872,"En arrivant, nous nous sommes tout de suite sentis à l'aise dans cet appartement spacieux, lumineux et très décoré. Une bouteille de vin nous attendait même sur la table ! Le quartier est central, tout en étant très calme, et il y a un café très sympa au coin de la rue. Pour ce qui est de l'appartement, nous n'avons manqué de rien et nous y avons bien dormi. Nous n'avons malheureusement pas pu profiter de la terrasse à cause de la météo, mais celle-ci était aussi jolie que sur la photo."
43204729,"I would highly recommend choosing this room! <br/><br/>Over the three nights me and my boyfriend stayed here, it really felt like home. The room itself is very comfortable, clean and peaceful (also great shower and super comfortable bed!); we both looked forward to coming back in the evening or during the day for a nap, with the added bonus of how close it is to the main hub of Amsterdam! It was such a lovely place to come back to and wind down. Despite it being so central however, you almost feel tucked away in your own quiet corner which for us was absolutely perfect and adds to how homely the room feels. To top it off, David was very welcoming (but non-intrusive) - the perfect host! I miss the room already! Would have happily stayed there a few more nights (or weeks... months...). Definitely would book again."
43209455,"Absolutely beautiful place. This apartment is perfect for those looking for something unique, that you will remember. Very cosy, warm place with nice comfy beds. All this plus a very friendly, quirky owner made our stay in this place fantastic. We also paid less for this place than we did for an 8 bed shard dorm at a hostel the night before!"
43242685,"le logement correspond à la description quoique le changement de disposition des meubles le rend moins spacieux<br/>proximité du centre de amsterdam très agréable et très pratique<br/>quartier nouveau agréable et calme<br/>le seul reproche concerne la propreté de la literie : en bon utilisateur nous avons défait les draps et avons découvert une couette tachée... et une alèze avec des ""anciennes tâches"" : pour nous c'est inacceptable. le coût d'un nettoyage pour une couette s'élevant à 15 euros et l'achat d'une alèze neuve autour de 30 euros...d'autant que une caution de 400 euros peut être prélevée si les locataires abîment quelque chose, nous avons dû mal à accepter la situation...<br/>le loyer n'étant pas dans les plus accessibles.<br/>pour le reste rien à dire,  nous ne regrettons pas notre séjour chez alicia. la prochaine fois, nous insisterons un peu plus pour connaître l'état de la literie. d'une excellente note, nous passons à une note très moyenne."
43267587,"Staying at Rosie's felt a little like having a home in Amsterdam. The house is vibrant with the warmth of a family, and i felt most welcome with all the family members being up for a talk when i got home. The room is very comfortable, as is the bathroom. And both were super clean. The yummy breakfast Rosie served every morning, with coffee, pancakes, and talks about almost anything, was the best way to start my days."
43303335,Staying with toetsie was my first Airbnb experience and she made me feel right at ease. She was also kind enough to have a bottle of wine in the evening put out and breakfast in the morning. I had a great experience and would definitely go back.
43328004,"Small cosy flat very well located in a dynamic neibourghood Perfect place and great guest.<br/>Great and clean flat very well located; close to the center of the city. Tram and buses litterally ""at the door"".<br/>Annemarie's sister has welcomed me and even drinks & frutis were already put for me.<br/>I can only recommend Annemarie & Patrick.<br/>Thank you Great place and great host.<br/>I have really enjoyed this nice ground floor flat. <br/>Very nice terrace to relax if the weather is nice, great main room and bed confortable.<br/>Malou was a really nice and warm host, she welcomed me and exlained me everything usefull in her flat.<br/><br/>would come again without a doubt.<br/>"
43332826,"Super appartement proche du centre d'Amsterdam. Une superbe ville, un super accueil. Merci à Hein pour tous ses conseils, on sent que c'est un amoureux de sa ville, on peut le comprendre... "
43388001,"Anneke's houseboat is THE place to stay in Amsterdam.  We were surprised by how easy it was to find her place by bike as the neighborhood is quiet and pleasant, with lots of great restaurants, and a sweet family feel.  But you are only about a 15 minute walk to the center of town.  Anneke could not have been nicer.  And how great was it to stretch out on the ""balcony"" with a glass of the Prosecco she kindly provided, after a long day of cycling. The houseboat is clean and comfortable with lovely artifacts she has collected in her travels.  And the breakfast was amazing!!  -- Really beyond belief with so many delicious offerings.  Anneke is a kind and generous host and we liked it so much, we came back to stay the night before we flew out of Schipol.  She even drove us to the train station.  We now have friend in Amsterdam, and I would never want to stay anywhere else."
43397848,"Place of residence is very good, Mis. Corina are very nice,price are reasonable,left us very good memories."
43402908,"Bronte made us feel very welcome, her flat was like a home away from home and very cosy. All information was given to us before we arrived and also local information on the table in the flat. "
43484981,"If you imagine the perfect accommodation (location, services, respect, style, cleanliness and communication), that's exactly how David's place was for us. <br/>I can't recommend enough this place as it was the perfect match for an extraordinary holiday week. <br/>Thanks David!"
43513685,S was so kind and accommodating and her apartment is absolutely lovely. The bedroom she set up for me was great and the bed was so comfortable! Her cat Naz is also a sweetheart. I had a great time staying here in Amsterdam :)
43531240,"My girlfriend and I could not have asked for a better trip to Amsterdam. Joke and Gerard are two of the most wonderful people we have ever met and because of them our trip could not have been better. We even managed to take the wrong ferry across the river when we arrived, but Gerard still came to pick us up despite the much further drive. When we got to the house we could not believe how beautiful it was. The bedroom is just perfect and the view of the canal is beyond what we could have hoped for. Gerard and Joke had countless tips and suggestions to give us to make sure we made the most out of our short weekend trip to the city.<br/><br/>Before arriving, we wouldn't have guessed that we would spend so much time at the house, but we enjoyed Gerard and Joke's company so much that we spent hours both days sharing drinks, food, stories and laughs. Gerard cooked us wonderful breakfast both mornings that we were there, and on our last day he brought us around the canals in Amsterdam center with his own boat. Everything about our trip was so delightful and we are so happy to have met Gerard and Joke and to call them our friends. Having to leave so soon was tough, but we will surely see them again during their travels to the states!"
43561706,"Bart's apartment is very well located - 15 mn from Central Station by foot or tram (don't take a boat !) - clean and quiet. Bart is very accommodating, and, as you asked me what you can improve, leave maybe something in the studio to make coffee or tea, and water... Otherwise, everything looks good."
43590826,"My experience at Laura's place was my favourite out of my whole vacation. If you get the chance to stay with them, you won't be disappointed. The suit is beautiful. 20 min walk to central station. There are lots of amazing shops and cafes along the way.  <br/>This couple truly cares about your comfort. Every morning they brought us a basket of breakfast, they even let us use their bikes for a day. And then to top it off gave us a private tour of the canals on their super cool boat. <br/>I would highly recommend staying here :) and hope I get to visit them again. <br/>Thanks for everything Laura and Arjan. We had the best time !!! "
43612916,"Micha was a very nice and affable person. We had received a very warm welcome. Apartment was close of metro station and matching exactly to pictures. Also Micha was kind to keep all required items, food, etc for us. It is definitely a very good apartment to go for...."
43615415,"Joke ist die perfekte Gastgeberin. Sie hat uns gleich am ersten Abend wunderbar mit einem  Stück Apfelkuchen empfangen. Wir hatten  eine fantastische Zeit in Amsterdam auch Dank Jokes Tipps, die sehr hilfreich waren. Das Frühstück war jeden morgen sehr, sehr lecker und abwechslungsreich. Dickes Danke auch von meiner Tochter für Rührei und Schinken! <br/>Die Unterkunft war wirklich gemütlich. Wir haben uns richtig wohl gefühlt bei Joke!! <br/>Es war toll. "
43643839,"Everything was perfect. The room was very clean, lovely and comfy. The Location of this room in the City is just great. Many lovely cafes are close by as well as restaurants. I can just recommend this room!<br/>"
43667649,"Carolien nous a tres bien reçus. Avec plein de petites choses à grignoter et à boire pour nos petits déjeuners. Elle était toujours disponible par texto ou mail pour nos donner des conseils et pour etre sure que nous étions bien dans son studio. Le studio correspondait exactement à la description. Tout etait parfaitement propre et agréable à vivre. <br/>Au bout de la rue nous pouvions prendre le tram 10 qui nous amenait en centre ville, le quartier etait calme. "
43685971,"A wonderful stay in Amsterdam.  Accommodations were both extremely  clean and cozy.  The hosts were inviting and friendly, but also gave us our privacy; the perfect combination.  Could not have been more pleased!  "
43705128,"Jeroen was a very nice and friendly host. He gave us much useful information about amsterdam and his tipps where to go were very helpful, because he could tell us about beautiful places in amsterdam which are not as much touristic as the centre. The restaurants he recommended were cheap and provided very good food. Although we had some change of our time plans at the arrival (sorry for the confusion) we could contact him easily and he reacted very flexible. He helped us where he could and was always available by phone or personally.<br/>The room is very nice (and the bed is really large although one cannot see this fact quite good on the picture but maybe we only did not want to believe that the matress is really 2.55m long) and the pinball machine is a must play for everyone. Although we had to share the bathroom with to other parties this was no problem, personally i didn't have to wait anytime for a free bath.<br/>The house is very quiet, we slept well but it's also very close to central station (about 10 minutes by bus).<br/>All in all I can say that if we'd travel again to amsterdam we would be very happy if the room is still free and I can definitely recommend it and of course Jeroen himself as a host."
43712203,"The apartment is nice and organizational stuff is well handled by Xion. The reason why I substract one star is the location of the apartment. In the end I felt that for my purposes it is too far outside the city center. Especially at night it will cost you quite a time to get home. That's why next time I will be in Amsterdam I will look out for a room or a flat closer to the city center, but surely this is  a matter of taste."
43737375,Our first experience as Airbnb guests was thoroughly enjoyable.  <br/>Laura and Arjan were very generous hosts who made us feel very welcome.  From the unexpected boat ride to the Rijksmuseum to the lovely breakfasts delivered each morning we could not  have been  better looked after. <br/>Arjan also came to the rescue with arranging repairs to a malfunctioning laptop. <br/>The apartment  is comfortable  and convenient - about a 10 minutes walk from one  of  the  city's main pedestrian  thoroughfares.  It is in a beautiful and picturesque location which manages to give a real sense of 'normal' living in Amsterdam - lots of families and kids going to school. We will certainly  be  recommending  this little  gem to family and friends.
43748363,"Très bon séjour chez Gerrit. La maison est spacieuse , àvec tout le nécessaire et bien aménagé. Il fait un peu sombre à l'intérieur et très frais du coup .. Voir trop .. Le petit jardin est adorable. 25 min de marche jusqu'au centre qu'on ne voit même pas passer tellement le quartier est mignon. Puis tram à 1 min de la maison. La salle de bain est très sommaire, et humide mais cela fait l'affaire. Nous reviendrons :) "
43800179,"Fantastic!<br/>We had such a lovely welcome aboard this incredibly clean, spacious and comfortable boat. It has everything you need (towels, robes, kitchen facilities etc) and should you need anything else, Peter was incredibly helpful. We loved sitting on the top of this boat in the sunshine with a glass of wine! We slept brilliantly - the bed is bigger than ours at home! We also had our 10 week old baby with us, and we had plenty of room. Location is also brilliant. Such a lovely stretch of the canal and very close to a tram stop with only a very short journey to all the major attractions. Would definitely recommend this boat to anyone coming to Amsterdam. Just brilliant!"
43831036,It was really great having stayed in  Marga's place. Whole family was welcoming and the the condition of the room was cozy and clean.
43835276,"The apartment is located in a nice neighborhood, it felt safe and was conveniently located close to good restaurants, shops and a nearby train station. Marijke was generous with tips for things to do and see nearby. <br/><br/>The accommodation is listed as Non Smoking. This is very misleading, as Marijke smokes in the house which causes smoke to fill the bedroom, hallway, toilet and shared bathroom areas, which made for a not-so-pleasant stay. There is no window to open for fresh air, anywhere. So you are dependant on the (smoky) ventilation of the rest of the house. <br/><br/>After alerting Marijke to the smoke smell being bothersome she switched on a 'air-cleaner' in the hallway and promised to keep the connecting door between her living/kitchen area and the hallway, closed. Unfortunately this only helped a little with the smell, and Marijke often left the connecting door open, so the smoke permeated. <br/><br/>Another concern was that every door in the entire apartment had a lock, except for the bedroom door, which was rather odd and made for very little privacy. <br/><br/>"
43840745,"We enjoyed our time on Harolds boat very much and felt at home immediately.<br/>Harold is an attentive host and the boat is very comfy and equipped with all necessary amenities ranging from hot shower, a fully equipped kitchen, electricity, central heating and a fireplace to even TV and WIFI. The boat is surrounded by other similar boats and boat people and has a nice and quiet atmosphere. A 10 to 15 minutes walk brings you to the tram station where a tram arrives every 5 minutes and takes you to the central station in about 10 minutes drive. A bus stop would be even nearer. So the location is perfect if you want to get to the city centre easily but want to have it a bit more quiet for the nights. Also the surroundings of Amsterdam - like Waterland - are quickly and easily reached by car.<br/>Thank you Harold, we had a wonderful time."
43892572,"Remco  was really helpful with finding places around. <br/>The flat was clean, very interesting structured and quiet."
43939537,"Warm and helpful host, big, bright and clean appartement, wonderful and convenient location. Fantastic stay."
43972771,Great
43992499,"David est un hôte super agréable, calme, posé et attentionné. <br/>La description du logement est telle que la réalité et il n'y a donc pas de fausse surprise.  De plus, ses mails sont clairs et très bien explicatifs... par exemple, aucune difficulté pour trouver le logement en venant de la gare centrale qui se trouve réellement à 5-10 minutes à pied, dans une rue calme, face à un canal, à proximité de la rue Zeedijg où l'on trouve de nombreux restaurants, bars et boulangeries, sans oublier le ""quartier rouge"" également à 10 minutes à pied. <br/>Le logement est super, cosy, moderne, très bien décoré, bien agencé avec une très très bonne literie, une salle de bains privée très fonctionnelle et tout le nécessaire pour prendre un repas (frigo, bouilloire, un peu de vaisselle).<br/>Bref, idéalement placé pour une très belle découverte d'Amsterdam."
44041911,"Travelled as a couple for my partners birthday and thought this place was an absolute stunner!! Cozy and homely, nothing to complain - it was luxury for us for sure!!<br/>The hosts Laura and Arjan were diamonds and looked after us very well, warm welcoming and a beautiful breakfast brought to us every morning! They also gave us a good little briefing and recommendations of Amsterdam with a cute little map, brochures and leaflets with an option to use the bicycles :)  <br/>The shower was a highlight itself! Bed was cozy and cuddly! Wifi was good! And breakfast in the basket with the fresh orange juice was delicious!!! <br/>We will definitely come to stay here again & recommend it to everyone else! Thank you so much Laura & Arjan!! Sending you our love from London Town!! "
44042385,"Gerard's place was near perfection, cosy little room with everything you may need, great location, would recommend if you're visiting Amsterdam. The only downside was that the wifi was very slow. Thanks Gerard for our lovely stay! "
44064806,"Beautiful, bright room in a lovely hosted bed and breakfast close to Amsterdam city centre <br/>I very much enjoyed my stay at Petra's bed and breakfast close to the Vondelpark in Amsterdam. Located close to the city centre it was easy to cycle to the old part of the city in just 5 to 10 mins. <br/>Petra has been a very welcoming host by communicating with me frequently even before my trip started by checking with me on my check in times and giving me useful info about how to reach the house best. I just met her briefly in person, but found her to be a very friendly, polite and caring person. <br/>The room has its own very modern bathroom with a large, beautiful shower and all the utilities you will need (towels, soap, shower gels and toothbrush cup) and is overall very fine in its style. <br/>I'd be happy to come here again if I visit Amsterdam another time - if you'd like to enjoy a comfortable and relaxed stay in town as well, Petra's place is definitely something for you, too."
44068268,"Ralph was a good host.. The apartment is really nice, it had everything and very good located.. Nevertheless, when we arrived to the apto there were some beer bottles in the roof top (seem like some one was there before us and didn't clean it at all).. But a side, it was really good!! "
44069415,Das Zimmer war sauber und gross genug. Der Gastgeber sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. Wir haben sogar ein Weihnachtsgeschenk bekommen. Herzlichen Dank David.
44079928,"Ein gemütliches Zimmer mit Bad in einem Haus von 1890. Handtücher wie im 4* Hotel.<br/>In unmittelbarer Nähe S-Bahnanschluss und täglicher Markt ( außer So.) mit Obst-Gemüse etc.<br/>Häuser aus der Zeit sind etwas hellhöriger das sollte man wissen. Die Baustelle im Nachbarhaus ist ab 8.30 zu hören, ich bin allerdings kein Langschläfer deshalb störte mich das nicht.<br/>Frische Blumen auf dem Zimmer heißen einen willkommen. "
44088155,Thank you so much Ingo.... You are a very nice and professional person and your apartment is so beautiful... Great !!!!
44089408,"Nous avons passé un très agréable séjour. La vue depuis la chambre est très belle, la décoration, exactement ce qu'on aime, l'accueil, très chaleureux et le petit déjeuner était copieux. Que demander de plus? <br/>Remarque : nous avions loué des vélos, nous étions donc autonomes et l'endroit n'étant pas loin du centre ville , c'était parfait."
44092778,"I strongly recommend any guests to stay at Marga's. Before I headed for Amsterdam, Marga had given me a lot of tips about how to arrive at her house. She offered to drive to pick me up from RAI station although I chose to walk on my own. Unfortunately the complex road condition made me lost and I called her twice to ask. Although she was busy with her work, she was patient with me, gave me guide and cycled to meet me up. Marga is so nice that she is making you feel at home. She is a caring person and happy to share good things with people. I learnt the goodness of the ginger drink from her. She is very friendly and talked with you gently. I found all her family are nice. Her oldest daughter hosted me later and we talked a lot. I like her very much. I like all Marga's cooking. Perfect family flavour. I really appreciated it.<br/>I stayed in the boathouse. It is spacious, pretty, artistic and cozy. Marga was trying her best to lower the family's voice although they were not loud at all. LOL. She didn't want to disturb me at all. The boathouse is so calm and quiet. I could hear gentle water sound and bird songs- so relaxing. The neiboughhood is green, quiet and safe. I enjoyed my stay a lot. Definitely I will choose to stay with Marga's family again next time I go to Amsterdam. Thank you Marga for all your kindness. :)"
44172785,"Perfect! everything was just perfect. Toetsie, the kindest person on earth, always there to help and really managed to make us feel like home in her place.<br/>The place itself is very nice, the room is all decorated with some little things, that make it look pleasant. The bed is just fine. The bathroom is good, though is shared with people from other room, when threre's someone else in the place. She also provides a freezer so you can put your stuff and a mini cooker.<br/>it's locate near to Oosterpark, and it's about 25-30min to most touristic places there using the TRAM (most if not all of them using the 9 Centraal Station)<br/><br/>And hey, no rolling or smoking inside! please, ask for the roof ;)"
44176732,"when i made the reservation it was the entire apartment not a share room in apartment when we got there it was some else in the other room ,sheets and apartment were not clean , we had problem with the hot water ,i won't recommend it to any one."
44185912,"Karlijn was a great host! From the beginning she kept in great touch and was really flexible when our arrival time kept changing due to flight difficulties. We would have been a group of 3 but one of our friends ended up unable to join at the last minute, and the apartment definitely would have comfortably accommodated all 3 of us. For just two people, it was super spacious! She left us a case of stroopwafels and a bottle of welcome wine which was so kind of her, and the house was immaculate when we arrived. It was clear that she had done a lot of preparation. There were also instructions about how to use everything in the house. She has a great little terrace overlooking a cute garden, and the neighborhood was very calm and relaxed - lots of families in the park nearby. We felt very safe. The location was only slightly further out than we might have preferred, but we should have used the tram more because it is a really efficient way of getting around. All in all, Karlijn was a fantastic host and I would 100 percent stay here again and recommend it to anyone who's heading to Amsterdam and wants a comfortable place to ""hang your hat."" "
44205150,"Mike is a friendly and helpful Airbnb host. We were made very welcome in his beautiful Amsterdam apartment, and communication was very easy. The apartment is completely self-contained, making it perfect for a longer stay. We found the local area to be lively and fun, you are right around the corner from bustling Albert Cuyp Market and lots of great restaurants. The apartment is beautifully decorated and we greatly enjoyed our stay, we would highly recommend this Airbnb!"
44283216,David was more than accommodating and really thought about the touches. The room  was very homely and for this reason we felt comfortable and didn't want to leave. We definitely recommend David as a host and would be more than happy to return again. Thank you so much for making our first trip to Amsterdam as perfect as it was. <br/>Lawry  and paizlee
44290510,"Le stanze e la casa rispecchiano esattamente quanto riportato nella descrizione.<br/>Il quartiere è tranquillo e il centro è facilmente raggiungibile.<br/>Olaf è una persona molto gentile e disponibile, senza mai essere invadente.<br/>La prossima volta che ritornerò ad Amsterdam, starò sicuramente ancora da lui!"
44392763,"David's place is amazing- the room was perfect- the bed was so comfortable, I found it hard to get out of bed, I could have spent my entire time in Amsterdam, staying in David's room alone. It had all the touches of a 5 star hotel. The location is excellent, close to everything and David and his partner were very kind and helpful. "
44407994,"Hein est un super hôte.<br/>Il nous a d'abord envoyé un mail avec le descriptif du trajet de l'aéroport d'Amsterdam jusqu'au studio.<br/>Son atelier est juste à côté du studio, il nous a accueilli avec un café et nous à conseillé des choses à faire dans la ville (notamment une super brasserie et un marché pas très loin du studio)."
44419524,"David room's location is amazing. Next to all the main streets, but far enough so you can sleep. This is a completely private room with it's bathroom. Everything was flawlessly taken care of. Will totally come back."
44441486,"It was my very first time traveling internationally so the train/tram system can feel overwhelming to a newbie from the US (especially on the west coast where our public transportation isn't as in depth) but Edwin made me feel very confident on how to navigate from Schipol to his place, even tells you how much you can expect to pay on taxi or train & tram. Once I got to the street I was just looking for the address & he was already expecting me because he opened the door and called out my name, now that's a host who you know has your back! The house has a very narrow, winding staircase & I had a huge heavy suitcase with me but Edwin just picked it right up & helped me out so quickly. He is very friendly and a lot of fun, he will talk to you like you're an old friend which is really cool and makes you feel like you really are staying with a friend and not a complete stranger! Edwin was fantastic at greeting me whenever I left and whenever I came back, which was awesome :) otherwise, he pretty much stays out of the way completely and you only really see him when you're coming and going so it's just the perfect amount of host-guest interaction. You do share one bathroom & there are 2 other guest rooms so if you have to go then go before someone else gets to it first! ;) The street is VERY loud with drunk people at night & trucks/garbage in the morning & the window faces the street so I was very fortunate to have brought earplugs with me! I highly suggest it ;) it's completely worth it though because the location is perfect. You're next to everything! Edwin has a lot of ""repeat offenders"" and I believe he and his sweet, beautiful feline just made a new one out of me if I ever find myself back in Amsterdam, which of course! :)"
44446193,Friedrich was an amazing host! His boat house was so lovely and perfectly located. The boat is very nice and the bed was incredibly comfortable! He was also very flexible and accommodating when we got in much earlier than expected. The city is at your doorstep and almost everything is a quick 10min walk away. We definitely will be making plans to stay on the Rosita again.
44492490,"Marion was such a amazing host, she help me with my mother's gluten free diet, suggest options for everything in the city from the best places to eat around to places to go and visit in the most efficient and fast way possible. She was always open to help and provide you with the best service possible. The neighbourhood is in a good location very close to a few museums and attractions for the city. The only thing I miss was having a key to get in a out without having to bother her to stay around or awake during late night times. "
44497808,"We had a great stay in Sjouke's dream house! <br/>Everything in it make you feel at home and so comfortable, besides being amazingly decorated and useful.<br/>If I go back to Amsterdam with a group of friends, I would definitely love to rent this house again :)"
44581354,"We were super happy about the choice. Dorien was very nice person with positive attitude and the apartment is really just in the same style :) <br/>Location is Very close to everything you need: supermarkets, pub, shops and caffe's. They are opening a new coffee shop just around the corner ( for those of you who are interested). You can rent the bike just 200 metres from the apartment, which is very handy. Bus stop is very close too. We had a great time here and we are looking forward to come back soon :) "
44599676,"I cannot recommend Laura and Arjan's place enough. The location is ideal...located on a scenic canal in a quiet area just minutes from the hustle and bustle of the city. The apartment itself was spacious, clean and had everything you needed. And I haven't even got to the breakfast yet: fresh croissants, eggs and fruit delivered every morning along with coffee and juice. What more can you want? Oh, and they let us borrow their bikes, which is truly the way to experience Amsterdam to the full extent. Laura and Arjan were very flexible with check-in/check-out, and even gave us a ride to the airport for our departure, which saved us a huge hassle. On top of all that, they're great people and a part of what makes AirBnB so great."
44635648,"Nous avons passé un super sejour. ""Rosita"" est très agréable, cosy et confortable! Friedrich est un hôte adorable, attentif et attentionné envers ses convives. C'est très appréciable. Et petit plus, il parle parfaitement le francais! Je le recommande vivement!!"
44718566,"Debby heeft een heerlijke kamer voor een verblijf in Amsterdam. De kamer is voorzien van een fijn en groot bed, een heerlijk gigantisch bad en alle gewenste voorzieningen (tafel met stoelen, kledingkast, koelkast, magnetron e.d.). De kamer ligt handig op steenworp afstand van de ten Kate markt, de hallen en de tram naar het cwntrum"
44734833,"Aart was very friendly only we didnt see him much<br/> The area the houseboat was situated was some 20 minutes by tram from Central Station and easy walk to the houseboat Unfortunatly there were no resturants or shops apart from a small supermarket that only opened 8-6pm nearby<br/>The houseboat only had a microwave oven which was not clean and what we thought was a coffe machine Neither had intructions as to how to use them we had never used either styles before <br/>What we would suggest is a Nespresso machine or similar and maybe a toaster with milk,bread,butter and maybe jam or similar so as we could make a basic breakfast We would have been prepared to pay a little more for the convience and not have  had to go into the city to have breakfast <br/>We also didnt bring any soap with us and there was none supplied for showering<br/>Also a TV or radio would have been great as there is nothing to do at night in the area and no connection to the outside world in the houseboat<br/>Only after searching around did we find the Internet code roughly written on an brocher I think a more formal folder with a few bits of local information and transport options would have been valuable<br/>"
44771085,"Wir (3 Personen) durften 5 Nächte bei Joke verbringen. Es war eine sehr nette Zeit die wir in ihrem schönen und gepflegtem Appartement hatten.<br/>Sie erwartete uns an unserem Ankunftstag sehr offen und nett und gab uns sehr viele Tipps und Infos wie wir am besten unsere Reise gestalten. Diese Unterstützung war sehr hilfreich und wir hatten daher keine Anfangsschwierigkeiten uns in der Stadt zurecht zu finden.<br/>Das Frühstück am Morgen war lecker und Joke war auch sehr flexibel mit den Uhrzeiten, wann wir essen wollten. Das Teilen der Waschräume hat auch immer perfekt geklappt.<br/>Alles in allem war der Aufenthalt toll!<br/><br/>Danke Joke."
44774597,"Laura is so nice and made us feel very welcome and at home here, and the apartment is really cute and cozy. We really enjoyed the experience and look forward to returning to Amsterdam!"
44807055,Our stay at Raul's was fantastic! He's super welcoming and friendly. Great facilities and super clean. Lot of space for 3 people. Convenient location and close to shops and quick walk to all the main sights. Really made our stay in Amsterdam great being able to come back to our warm comfy little home. Thanks Raul! 
44822714,"We had a perfect stay in a wonderful Appartement and Barbara, who did welcome and has explained everything to us, was the perfect host.<br/>"
44825202,Very nice place! Jeroen gave us very good tips of places to go. Totally recomend it!!
44853894,This listing is amazing! Toetsie made me feel welcome from day one. She provided info and a bottle of wine :). She also let me borrow her spare bike which was a huge plus in getting around. I would definitely stay with her again on my next trip 
44876879,Nimas place is located in a beautiful and calm neighborhood with very cool and hip restaurants and bars next to the pier. The ferry goes by very often and leaves you right in the Central Station. We had a lovely stay. Thanks Nima :)
44941997,"The apartment is on a shop at 3-4th floor, it is a little bit small but cute. Even every thing is good there, I have to say the stairs are narrow, for us is really hard to move our big luggages, and we see a mouse the day before we leave. Expect this, the position is really really convenient, it close to Ann frank house and central station."
44944480,"Séjour très agréable, quartier sympa! "
44946480,"We loved absolutely everything about this charming little studio. <br/>Great location with loads of connections and plenty of nice places just around the corner and great value for money. A very warm welcoming from Hein, who gave us useful tips about where to go, made us feel at home straight away. <br/>The place was clean and had everything you need for a comfortable stay.<br/>Overall great experience and we will gladly come back if we have the opportunity. "
44998160,"We truly enjoyed staying in Martine's home. She is a very nice, kind and welcoming host! It was clean and tidy and we felt very comfortable. Regarding the fact that we both were terribly ill when we arrived - it was almost as good as if we were at home. Thank you!"
45125792,"Mike was very welcoming and accomodating throughout our stay. When we arrived he carried up my suitcase up very steep steps to the apartment, I really appreciated that. The apartment was very clean and tidy just as the pictures show. I loved all the small touches Mike and family put in to the apartment, there were flowers in a small vase, fruit in the kitchen along with Amsterdam guide books and history.<br/><br/>The local neighbourhood was lovely, we really enjoyed local restaurants, cafe's and the market all are very close to the apartment. It is very easy to get around Amsterdam from the place, to get to central if you were to walk it took us about 40minutes. However there are lots of transports links that we used to get around in much quicker time. It was great being able to go in central so easily from the apartment as we spent most of the day time there. We used the app citymapper which is fantastic, I use it back home all the time to get around London, would definitely recommend getting this app.<br/><br/>Amsterdam itself is really beautiful and I would highly recommend this Apartment and City to anyone. We definitely would love to come back   to the city/apartment as its been our favourite place so far! <br/>"
45171871,"We loved staying in this local style house. The neighbourhood was very cultural, and had a large market. <br/>While Toetsie was not there her cat was kind enough to greet us everyday. She also left us food and instructions to help us get around and to Amsterdam centraa on the nearby train station. "
45206625,"Edwin's place was great! it is very much in the center and very accessible to anywhere. Edwin helped me get settled and made me feel very much at home. His personality is great and very welcoming and we easily clicked!<br/><br/>"
45206626,"Nima was a great host, room and common places clean. Easy communication from the city center. Perfect quality for the money payed."
45209840,"Great boat, great host, great place to stay a few days in Amsterdam.<br/>The boat is well equiped and perfect for a family stay. Close to city center with tram and buses next to it with direct lines to musuems and historic center. <br/>The area is very pleasant to walk around and convinient for food shopping. <br/>Great welcome from Grietje who is always there when necessary.<br/>Very nice stay. We recommand the place original and pleasant for a family stay.<br/>Angélique, Guihem and his family."
45235137,"The apartment was wonderful, just as described. The neighborhood was quiet yet had some great restaurants and bars very close by. Some of the main attractions (Van Gogh Museum, Rijksmuseum, Heineken Experience, etc.) were also in walking distance which was fantastic. Mike was a great host and made sure we had everything we needed for our stay. We highly recommend staying at this apartment!"
45255297,"Beautiful place, beautiful experience. <br/>I highly recommend Sheryl 's house because is in one of the best area of Amsterdam. <br/>The house is Big, clean and a super comfortable place where you can spend your time in Amsterdam! <br/>5 stars. "
45335354,"The cottage was so cute and comfy and amazing to hangout in during the rainy days we were there. We made a best friend, who happens to be a chicken who liked to stare at us all day from the window. Everything was great, the hosts were amazingly adorable.<br/>Only issue would be that there is no place to cool besides a microwave of tiny bucket of charcoals. I wish that was explained a little in the Airbnb post for this cottage, since we were there for a week we had to make due with what we could. It just felt like camping but in a cottage. ;)"
45384580,Very friendly and hospitable people. It's located pretty close to the center in a quiet neighborhood.
45388189,Petra was very nice and frendly and helpful. We felt confortable and taken care of. The room was fantasic and the bed was confortable. The neighbourhod was quiet and the vondelpark nice. Our warmest recomendations!
45393813,"Probably the best experience I had so far, regardless of how good the rooms are, the fact that you live in the top of her house makes you feel like it's your home.<br/>The price per night and the location of the house it's perfect, 1 stop to central station and 10 min walk from Sloterdijk.<br/>But the best thing is the host:Nadia, she treated me like my mom, she drove me several times to important appointments I had to get my own flat and she did it just for helping me, if it weren't for her I would be sleeping in the floor of my new house the whole weekend.<br/>Thank you Nadia"
45413456,The appartment is beautiful and seems that someone has given a thought to every detail! the location is not in the turistic center and we liked it. Mike is great and was kind and welcoming.
45430968,"The appartment was way more spacious than expected. Though only 3 nights, the three of us were very comfortable staying at your appartment. Everything was very clean and we were provided with even more than we needed. Perfect location, perfect stay. Thank you."
45445411,"Très bel appartement! Facile d'accès en tram et bus. L'environnement est fort calme, lit très très confortable! <br/>Bronte donne beaucoup d'infos pratiques et de bons plan pour visiter Amsterdam. Elle reste en plus très disponible et soucieuse de notre confort!<br/>Un grand merci !"
45472460,"Marga and her family are really the kind of people you enjoy to met: nice people! <br/><br/>The place is awesome: the guesthouse is really cosy, with a wood stove which means that even with a cold night you can enjoy a warming fire ! The fire was lighted before I came, - so much attention -. There is also a piano in the guest house, which I really appreciated after a full day of work! The houseboat where live the family can be accessed. I enjoyed having a breakfast, chatting while looking at the Amstel river.<br/><br/>Marga sent me details to go her home and Rico, her husband, came to pick me up at the tram station. He was really nice has he waited for me as my train had around half an hour delay. <br/><br/>Definitely a place to be if you don't want to be in the touristic area.<br/><br/>The only difficult thing is when you need to leave the place. Such a wonderful moment. I'll definitely come back at Marga guest house!"
45475541,"This was a spectacular Airbnb experience. Arjan collected us AND dropped us off at the airport and made our stay in Amsterdam effortless and easy. Location was perfect on a canal near the old town.  Breakfast was the best we ever had.  Arjan was such a great host, so friendly and helpful.  We highly recommend this place to anyone! This was an interesting place to stay...close to the center of Amsterdam. It worked well as a place to spend a nightbefore we started a river cruise. Robert was an excellent host and a fantastic chef...breakfast was phenomenal!"
45509396,"He had a great experience at Louis' home. The house is beautiful and charming, it's in a great location (15' to city centre) it has 2 very good reataurants aside and a supermarket crossing the street... Everything you need to rest after sightseeing.<br/>(Only the stairway to the bedrooms is a bit challenging.)<br/>If you like running, Vondelpark is close too.<br/>Louis? He is a Cool guy and everything was alright with him.<br/>I would repeat if I come back to Amsterdam."
45526826,"This was as close to perfect as can be without staying in your own home. Clean, spacious, comfortable, nicely furnished, stocked with amenities, great neighborhood, nice neighbors, good location, everything was top notch.  We were met by the host's friend who gave us the lay of the neighborhood and the city, showed us the apartment and was a resource if we needed (which we didn't because everything was perfect!).  This would be a great place for 1 or 2 couples, 2 or 3 work colleagues, or a family with older children.  I loved Amsterdam and want to return with my husband (this was a work trip) and wouldn't want to stay anywhere else.  Karen was easy to contact and answered all my questions during the booking process. I can't think of anything that was lacking or could be improved on.  A++++"
45545713,"Very nice place. A bit different from the pictures some changes have been made in the living room and the second room... However Saskia has been very good host, available and flexible. Beds are very comfortable. I highly recommend the place"
45572850,"Superbe appartement,  agencé avec goût et très confortable, il est idéalement situé ( tout à fait conforme au descriptif). Guido, n'était pas là pour nous accueillir, mais une jeune femme charmante nous attendait. Nous avons été très sensibles aux gentilles attentions, magnifique sapin de Noël  et petits trucs à  grignoter. Tout était parfait, nous avons passé 4 jours merveilleux à Amsterdam et avons beaucoup apprécié notre première expérience  airbnb. Petit bémol, les matelas ne sont pas très propres , mais ils sont très confortables. Et nous avons eu la visite d'une souris gourmande qui a apprécié la plaquette de beurre."
45600231,Nabilla's studio is lovely place just next to the center. We had good communication exchange by sms and Nabilla'd do the best to enhance your trip. Tram is about 5min walking and nearly 4€/pax but a bit long (40min). 
45603556,"A nice apartment and great hosts! We couldn't have been made to feel more welcome. In addition to great tips from Lucie, there was also helpful info on the area in the apartment. It is very close to the Van Gogh and Rijksmuseum which was perfect for getting there early before the rush later in the day. "
45621670,"This apartment is absolutely wonderful, and Mike is a great host! The apartment is clean, modern, and well located (within a ten minute walk to the Museumplein area). The apartment is in a quite neighborhood next to a beautiful park. I'd give our Amsterdam experience a 10 out of 10 and this apartment played a large part in that!!"
45665138,"Nous avons eu une expérience fantastique à Amsterdam, et Joke en fait définitivement partie ! Elle a été plus qu' accueillante avec nous, et très chaleureuse (malgré notre arrivée tardive). Joke nous a fourni toutes sortes d'informations pour passer un excellent week-end : des informations pratiques, des conseils sur les marchés, les musées, les quartiers intéressants à visiter. Les petit-déjeuners étaient très bons, le café excellent, et le souci du détail délicieux ! Elle a également été attentive à nos préférences alimentaires. Et l'appartement est tout simplement  impeccable ! Joke, vous nous avez fait sentir ""at home"". Thanks a million (petite expression irlandaise !). "
45665378,"This was my first experience with air BnB, after being in hotels for the last 2 weeks this little shack was like a breath of fresh air. Marga and her husband are lovely people and I only regret not spending more time with them. Typically I am always out on holidays exploring. Yes I would highly reccomend this charming hobbit house and Marga is a fantastic host."
45702269,"Our stay at Femke's apartement was fantastic. The apartement was perfect , it was quiet, clean, had all the necessary things and the beds were really comfy. We enjoyed to relax in the apartement after a day of sightseeing. The connection to the city center is very convenient and we really recommend this place. "
45714819,"Clean, independent and very central located room. Close to the flower market. Good value for money. "
45744206,"Location location location!!! What a wonderful little room in the heart of Amsterdam. My boyfriend and I stayed for 4 nights and everything was wonderful. It is walking distance to everything from the museums to the red light district. Karin was very helpful and provided us with a book of recommendations of which we went to 'Asian Fusion' restaurant just up the road and it did not disappoint! Perfect homely room to rest after a long day touring Amsterdam, will 100% be returning! Thank you Karin. "
45756022,"Great apartment, spacious and clean. A touch further from the city center than anticipated, but not inconveniently so. "
45759118,"I had a great time with my friends in fennos flat. Its a great location, very close to the famous jordaan quarter. Fenno provided us everything for breakfast and was always available via Facebook to give us tips for some  events in the city. I definitely would stay there again!"
45763339,I stayed with 3 friends in this apt! we had a great time and the hosts were very hospitable and the place was very clean! The first bedroom is more of a studio with a nice kitchen bathroom bed and living room area. The second bedroom was down the hall which was nice because it had its own bathroom as well as a tub! Both rooms hav a balcony to sit and enjoy the scenery and weather. Owners live next door and were very helpful with anything we needed. 
45804879,"Nous avons séjourné 3jours chez Gina qui nous a très bien accueillie. Le logement est très chaleureux et très agréable à vivre. Le fait que ce soit une dépendance permet de garder notre intimité pendant le séjour. L'appartement est très propre et très bien équipé pour une courte durée. Je recommande vivement cet appartement et ces hôtes. Le jardin est aussi très agréable! Nous reviendrons surement ! ;)<br/>Aurélie "
45831710,"Indescritível. Viola e Daniel são excelentes anfitriões e nos receberam com muita atenção e carinho. O apartamento é lindo, completo, bem decorado, confortável (principalmente a cama, após longos dias de caminhada...rsrs), limpo e tem uma linda vista. <br/>A localização é muito boa. Afastada do barulho do centro da cidade, mas de fácil acesso a todos os lugares, seja a pé, de ônibus ou de Tram (n.º 3).<br/>Logo abaixo do apartamento encontra-se o Mad´s Café, um lugar delicioso, com um excelente atendimento que vale a pena conhecer.<br/>Fiquei hospedado com a minha namorada e adoramos a experiência, recomendamos a todos que queiram viver Amsterdam.<br/>Voltaremos com certeza!!!"
45923238,"Hein is nice and welcoming, the tiny studio is situated in the quiet university area. However, to pay 15% of commissions to Airbnb seems quite exaggerated."
45923469,"We had a wonderful time in this amazing flat. <br/>From the welcome to the our exit Mike our  host thought of everything and his beautiful home made us want to stay longer. The location was perfect, the coolest area in Amsterdam for sure. <br/>The city has so much to offer we didn't see everything we wanted to on this trip so will for sure be making a return trip soon. We hope to be able to stay at Mike's lovely place again if available. <br/>"
45950559,"Hemos tenido una excelente estadia, el departamento es impecable, con todo lo que se requiere para pasarla bien.  Muy buena ubicacion , a pasos de todo"
45959083,"This was our first Airbnb experience. Mike was a very helpful host and all was ready in the specified time of booking in. The tall windows letting in welcome light and King bed, as well as interesting art on the walls, made this a lovely haven after sight seeing all day. The kitchen was well supplied and Mike was very thoughtful to put in bottles of mineral water, juice, butter etc. to start us off in the week we spent there. It was a restful stay and the apartment is opposite a lovely park. Saraphatipark is a really vibrant place with lots of cafes and shops that are quirky with the street market nearby open every day except Sunday. The tram takes you into the heart of Amsterdam in 15 min and you can walk to the Museums in about 15-20 min.It's not so touristy here, that's why we picked it. It's a trendy, colourful suburb and we thoroughly recommend it. Thank you Mike for everything!"
46015097,"We would like to thank you Petra very much! We had lovely time in Amsterdam! Petra's apartment is really nice, tidy and there's plenty of space. It's located in quiet area, 10min walk from station, you can catch there tram, bus, metro or train, so you can get to city center in 15min and to the airport in 5min. We're totally coming back there someday!"
46029492,Naomi and her husband Joost were fantastic and wonderful hosts who were so helpful and approachable! Their apartment is cozy and comfortable and located in a great area with easy access to many famous Amsterdam attractions. Iambnb were very helpful and assisted us with our check-in and any queries we had prior to arriving in Amsterdam. Thanks for a great stay!
46099520,"We were warmly met by Tanja, who allowed us to put our luggage in the apartment, even though we arrived too early in the morning. After Tanja showed us the room, which is absolutely the same as on the pictures: nice, warm and clean. We had a coffe machine, a fridge with some cheese, beer and some other drinks. Everything was really fine till the last, second, night when we were friendly visited by the Netherland mouse. Tanja told that there are no mice in their house, however, warned us to keep the food in the box. We did that, however, of course maybe some small pieces of food fell on the floor during our breakfast. Thus the whole second night we were watching and listening to the creeping mouse in the room. We saw it later in the morning as well. Overall, the apartment and the hosts are very nice but the last point spoiled a bit the staying."
46102154,"I had a wonderful stay at Danielle's clean and comfortable home. Communication was easy and she was accommodating <br/>of the check in time that suited me.  The room offered plenty of privacy, but Danielle was also kind enough to invite me to breakfast which gave me the opportunity to learn a bit about the culture in Amsterdam. I had some difficulty connecting to wifi throughout my stay, but this didn't bother for me for one night. I recommend this place for other solo travelers!"
46155377,"He was really really helpfull and kind. Flat was nice furnished, clear and huge. 100%!!!!!!!!"
46171698,We strongly recomend to stay at Hein s. He brought us a map with his recomendations. The room was confortable and well equiped. Hein was always avaiable for any help. Very good hoster.
46207098,"What an amazing place!!! 10 of us had the greatest weekend in Amsterdam, made complete by Taco' warehouse. <br/><br/>All was exactly as described, exceeded expectations. Yes, it's not central, but the location is perfect for a group who want to play music and socialise, and the walk and ferry is a treat, although will hire bikes next time for the trip to central station. The speakers & acoustics are lovely & the pool table was constant use.<br/><br/>Our welcome and care whilst staying was superb, arranged groceries for arrival and on hand if needed. Really friendly, lovely, team. <br/><br/>If your looking, book it. Can't regret.<br/><br/>Will all be back soon (if you will have us??) <br/><br/>Much love "
46224989,"La habitación fue muy confortable y cálida, el espacio muy agradable y acogedor, dormimos de maravilla, el apartamento está muy bien ubicado y las rutas de transporte disponibles en cualquier momento, los accesos geniales, Jeroen es un gran anfitrión que estuvo al pendiente de nosotros en todo momento, antes durante y después, súper recomendable!!"
46265331,"Lovely apartment in the heart of Amsterdam. The location is very convenient, few minutes walking from the Central Station and right next to the Singel. I have walked to most places from the apartment.<br/>The apartment looks exactly as on the pictures. The host, Brigit, is a lovely and caring young lady. A basket with items for breakfast for my two week stay was provided, as well as some other items in the fridge. Tea and coffee are also provided. The apartment was also very clean and a cleaner comes once a week.<br/>The fact that Brigit lives next door is very convenient. For example, she gladly assisted with the delivery for my laundry when I was away. That was very helpful!<br/>Information and maps on most attractions in the city are also provided by the owner.<br/>Finally, the apartment has a warm and welcoming feel. It was surprisingly quiet even though close to major attractions.<br/>I would definitely consider going back in this apartment during my next stay in beautiful Amsterdam!"
46267042,Everything was terrific. Location and atmosphere. We did not know what to do with the trash and hope it wasn't an issue. Would highly recommend to anyone wanting to visit Amsterdam. <br/>Cheers
46277036,"Joost kam am Anreisetag vorbei, erkundigte sich freundlich nach unserem Wohlergehen, erklärte alles Wichtige und gab uns Tipps fürs Essen und Sightseeing. Perfekt und sympathisch! Das Hausboot übertraf unsere Erwartungen und wir waren sehr begeistert von dieser originellen Unterkunft. Die Einrichtung ist originell und man könnte gut auch selber kochen und auf dem Schiff  leben. Ein kleiner Nachteil war, dass es recht ringhörig ist und man somit nicht soviel Privatsphäre hat. Auch das Oberdeck könnte liebevoller gestaltet sein, z.B. mit Blumen und einer Abdeckung gegen die Strasse. Aber alles in allem hat es uns sehr gut gefallen und wir würden diese Unterkunft wieder buchen. Die Lage ist perfekt, viele Kaffees in der Nähe und auch der Markt am Samstag war genial."
46292985,"Wat een fantastische locatie, recht tegenover het fraaie Sarphatiepark, het was al een genot om daar te lopen, zoekende naar  nr93.<br/>Mike was een vriend vanaf het moment dat hij de deur voor ons opende en ons een heel warm welkomsgevoel gaf."
46356034,"Das Apartment ist eine echte Designer-Loft inmitten eines der lebendigsten Viertel Amsterdams. Es ist hell, geräumig, freundlich und macht gute Laune. Die Küche ist mit allem notwendigen ausgerüstet und hat eine prima Espressomaschine. Trotz lebendigen Treibens rundherum, schläft man sehr ruhig.<br/>Man kommt vom günstigen Park&Ride Parkhaus Olympia (1€/Tag) mit der Tram in ca. 12 Minuten fast direkt vor die Haustür. Die Ajax-Fahrradvermietung ist ebenfalls gleich ums Eck. Zu Museumsareal sind es ca. 10 Gehminuten. Wunderbare Restaurants, Kneipen und Lebensmittelläden findet man gleich unten auf der Straße.<br/>Die Kommunikation mit unserem Vermieter Mark Jan war sehr freundlich, prompt  und problemlos. <br/>Alles in allem haben wir hier ein super Wochenende verbracht und kommen gerne wieder."
46399336,"Great place. Beautiful, bright, spacious and comfortable. Very modern. Very close to RAI station which made it super convenient to go into the city and the airport. <br/>Nancy was also very easy to reach and prompt in her reply. The apartment was very easy to find<br/>"
46437792,"Esperienza fantastica!<br/>Era la prima volta che io e mio marito viaggiavamo con Airbnb e siamo rimasti davvero soddisfatti.<br/>Mike ci ha accolto calorosamente anche prima dell'orario stabilito per il check-in permettendoci di lascire le valigie per poter cominciare ad andare in giro per la città.<br/>Al nostro ritorno la casa era perfettamente in ordine e pulita con le nostre valigie all'interno.<br/>Moke ci ha fatto trovare asciugamani puliti, bagnoschiuma e shampoo, nonchè il necessario per la colazione (caffè, thè, tisane, marmellata, acqua e succhi di frutta).<br/>Abbiamo trascorso un soggiorno tranquillo, l'appartamento si trova in una zona residenziale poco rumorosa, con tanti locali in cui mangiare nei dintorni e vicino alla fermta del tram.<br/>Anche l'ultimo giorno Mike si è offerto di tenere le valigie fino al momento della nostra partenza.<br/>Complessivamente è stata una bella esperienza e consiglio l'appartamento di Mike a chiunque voglia passare qualche giorno ad Amsterdam in tranquillità."
46453663,"Mike est un hôte très accueillant et agréable. Il a su se rendre disponible et arrangeant face à une situation médicale qui aurait pu gâcher notre séjour. Merci à lui pour son soutien.<br/><br/>Séjour du coup très agréable néanmoins, dans un quartier où il fait bon vivre (ambiance, vie de quartier, ...), avec des facilités de transport pour circuler dans la ville.<br/>"
46454466,Very nice flat near metrostation. I recommend ever 
46470732,This is a beautifully decorated property with spacious rooms and bathrooms. We made use of the kitchen facilities for breakfast and dinner and Petra even bought us down some beer glasses for drinks we had bought! On the second night of our stay Petra had sushi and left me a plate in the fridge with soy sauce and chopsticks.. her hosting skills are the epitome of extra-mile. Very friendly and welcoming without being over bearing and on call at all times for the slightest thing. The house itself is in a quiet residential area next to the stunning and well worth a visit Vondelpark and has very easy links to the centre of town. Very close to a lidl for any food needs and directly opposite a wonderful local restaurant. Would absolutely recommend to all. 
46485486,"In der Wohnung von Laura und Christian fühlt man sich sofort zuhause. Perfekt! Die Gegend ist angenehm ruhig und mit dem Fahrrad ist man in 5 Minuten an der Fähre. Die beiden Katzen sind sehr süß und umgänglich. <br/>Laura hat uns bei der Ankunft alles gut erklärt und Tipps gegeben. Sie war eine sehr sympathische Gastgeberin. Und vielen Dank an dieser Stelle nochmal für die großzügige zeitliche Handhabung bei unserer Abreise. "
46563422,"It was the first stay for me and my friends using Airbnb. We were surprised positively! The house is so colourful, full of Mickey Mouse characters and everything was cleaned and tidy ! The rooms were perfect for us, all essentials we needed. Olaf was so kind to us, he told us more about Amsterdam and what we should visit. The area, that Olaf lives is so quiet with many shops, cafes etc. around. It was a pleasure to stay in his house! "
46564007,"La localización y el barrio eran magníficos, muy bien situado en pleno centro. No obstante, la descripción dejaba bastante que desear al compararla con la realidad, puesto que solo tiene una habitación con una escalera un poco peligrosa para acceder y lo demás son sofás camas algo incómodos en el salón/comedor. Creo que también habría que informar de los dos pisos de largas escaleras que hay que subir para llegar al piso, puesto que no hay ascensor y es difícil subir con pesadas maletas."
46680775,地段不错，博物馆区、运河码头、喜力啤酒体验中心都在15分钟的走路半径内。房间很宽敞，餐厅、客厅与厨房及前后露台同在2层，视觉上很舒服。但是，所谓三个卧室，其实那个儿童卧室基本不能睡觉—里面看起来很脏，柜子上摆满了毛绒玩具，两张床都是上下床，睡在上方空间很小很压抑，床品非常儿童化，而且看起来很旧，不舒服。我们四个人只使用了另外两间卧室，有个人宁愿睡沙发也不愿意睡儿童间。还有，由于房东仍然在使用这套房子，所以屋子里面都是房东一家的私人用品。所以，生活用品一应俱全，但同时也显得非常杂乱。照片美化了环境，最吸引人的露台基本没用，因为根本没有景观可言。
46720129,"David was a very welcoming and friendly host, our room had just been cleaned on our arrival. The view from the window is beautiful and is definitely the highlight of the room. The location is perfect, 5 minutes from the station, and 2 minutes away from omelegg which is a must have.<br/>10/10 Thank you David."
46751027,"Nous n'avons eu aucuns contacts avec Hans, tout est passé par AirBnb. <br/>l'appartement est bien situé, 15min de marche du centre ville. <br/>Petits bémols sur la baignoire qui ne fonctionne pas, ainsi que plusieurs ampoules cassées. Appartement notés 2 chambres alors qu'il n'y en a qu'une...<br/>Sinon Amsterdam est une ville magnifique où il fait bon vivre"
46773945,"There was a slight delay during the key collection. However, while the apartment was not provided in the cleanest state, the overall stay was pleasant. Apartment was well-equipped and located near the metro. "
46830404,"Gabriella et John sont des personnes formidables et d'une grande générosité. Ils savent recevoir et mettre à l'aise leurs visiteurs. Leur grand appartement est à leur image, magnifique et convivial.<br/>La chambre est somptueuse et le lit d'un grand confort.<br/>Leurs conseils et petites adresses, nous ont permis de découvrir la belle Amsterdam sous ses multiples facettes.<br/>Gabriella et John sont de grands ambassadeurs pour AIRBNB qui méritent 10 étoiles."
46831930,"Standard airbnb offer, came with a few bad surprises, the bathtub does not work, the shower can not exceed 40 Celsius, told at last moment someone else was with us. A useful apartment (not too far), but nothing exceptional."
46839016,"The location is perfect, very central and close to everything. The room is large and spotless. David was very accommadating storing our luggage when we arrived early in the morning and after we checked out."
46919104,Davvero una bella casa. Ottima l'accoglienza e la generosità dei proprietari. Abbastanza vicino ai mezzi di trasporto. Li vicino c'è un fantastico parco e un percorso per l'allenamento davvero incantevole.
47082337,"We had a really great time in Amsterdam and this lovely little flat played a big part in this! We fell in love with it the moment we walked in: bright, modernly furnished rooms looking like they're out of some stylish furniture magazine - classy and comfortable at the same time. It only takes you about 15 minutes to get to the busy city (the ferry is for free and runs the whole night) but you'll be definitely looking forward to return to your new cosy home, that's for sure. Oh, and before I forget, Bart, the owner of this place is really nice and very helpful. To make a long story short, this flat is amazing and makes us two more than happy airbnb customers!<br/>"
47086792,"Olaf is a very friendly, cheerful and welcoming host and made us feel at home at the apartment immediately by offering us dutch waffles and tea. Before arrival he gave us clear directions to navigate to his house which made things very easy. The house is very spacious and beautifully decorated, and probably has everything you need in a holiday home in it. It is in a quiet area yet not far from museums and the city centre. Definitely would recommend staying and would love to come back myself!"
47147598,"Matthijs a été un hôte parfait ! Malgré notre arrivée tardive il s'est montré disponible et très accueillant ! <br/>La chambre est très agréable et très cosy, le linge de toilette était très propre et changé tous les jours. Le bed and breakfast est idéalement situé sans avoir les inconvénients qui peuvent être liés aux bruits de la ville. <br/>Le petit déjeuner pris dans la boulangerie était délicieux et très copieux, l'établissement est très mignon et le personnel adorable !<br/>Vous l'aurez compris nous recommandons vivement le bed and breakfast de Matthijs et espérons revenir très rapidement !<br/>Thierry & Adeline"
47169929,찾기 쉬운 위치에 있고 조용한 동네에요. 집도 깨끗하고 호스트도 친절해요. 추천해주는 근처 레스토랑들도 모두 훌륭했어요. 베스트는 아니어도 좋은 추억이었어요.
47175761,"Christopher is a great host, very friendly and easygoing. Was my first experience with a host and wouldn´t be better. He provided me with guides and maps about Amsterdam, allowing me to discover places that I hadn't noticed before! He was very welcoming and helpful, always available to chat and he made me feel like to be at home.   Cosy and heart warming apartment, the room is  comfortable and very clean with an amazing bed. The location is excellent, very close to Muiderport station, just 5 minutes walking. It is easy to take train, bus or tram. The neighborhood is very interesting to walk around, with good options to eat and drink. I highly recommend this place."
47181047,"Our hosts were very welcoming, with a nice bottle of red wine and cheese waiting for us on arrival. This was very much appreciated after a long journey with kids!  Esther was always very quick in replying to any of my questions before hand.  We had someone waiting at the property for us, to give us a quick tour and explain how everything worked. <br/>The house was lovely and spacious. We were very impressed with the 12 foot Christmas tree! The out door area would also be great to use in the summer time. <br/>The house is in a very impressive area, we never got taxis but walked everywhere. Vondel Park is great for the kids. Short walk to the Van Gogh museum, supermarkets and many restaurants and bars. <br/>We had a great time staying here and would highly recommend it to anyone. "
47199475,"Everything is perfect! Olaf is a very good host, he is a friend of Mickey Mouse and Mickey Mouse give us some chocolates and keychain when we're leaving the house. Thank you to Olaf, all the best in your business! "

El desayuno grandioso, yogurt con fruta y miel, queso, jamón, etc. Esta en una zona muy tranquila con una vista hermosa. No está muy cerca del centro pero si buscas un poco de tranquilidad viene  perfecto.  Gracias a Maike y Caspar."
47411365,"first of all i expected two rooms with two double beds,the place is not as it looks nor as described,certainly you cant call this place as a three room place,with 3 beds,1 double bed and 2 air mattresses hardly qualify as a 2 bedroom place,to top it all up THIS IS ONLY SUITABLE FOR 4 PEOPLE......."
47442792,"Hello John & Gabriella,<br/><br/>It was an indeed a pleasure staying at your place. <br/><br/>We could not have asked for a better Bnb experience than what we got and you have really taken the bar very high for anyone else to match. <br/><br/>No 5* hotel room could match the conform and coziness you bring with your place. Your house is beautifully done with all the right things occupying their perfect place.<br/><br/>John special thanks to you for making our trip to Amsterdam a beautiful and a memorable one. Without your guidance we could not have covered so much in a short stay at your place. <br/><br/>Although I did not tell my wife about the beautiful cats at your place as she is scared of them but you made sure that she had no problems what so ever. <br/><br/>I am so happy to have chosen your place and if ever come back again I will make sure to stay with you (hope it's available :)).<br/><br/>Thanks.<br/>Kumar & Divya "

47567973,"This loft is the best you can find! Amazing location (10 minutes in Tram from the center), clean and beautiful design, optimal for 2 couples (the two rooms are separated with hallway). The loft is equipped with everything- shampoos, lotions, new towels, coffee machine and more. Esther and Marco were so kind, helpful, and they even invited us the celebrate new year with them and gave us home made soup. Even after we Left they helped us a lot. We recommend it and sure will be back! <br/>תודה רבה מישראל :) "

47652598,Appartamento collocato in un quartiere tranquillo e ben collegato con i mezzi per arrivare al  centro della città!<br/>Jordis è stata molto gentile fornendoci informazioni sui vari spostamenti e su dove mangiare...<br/>Le uniche  note negative sono state il bagno senza porta (solo una semplice tendina) e l' eccessiva polvere in tutta la casa!
47671425,"Malou's place was everything we could've expected and more! The reason we picked her place was because of her beautiful photos on the site and how vividly her apartment was depicted. However, we couldn't have imagined how great it actually was. First and foremost I felt right at home walking into a home with many books especially beautiful editions of Annie Leibovitz and Tom Ford coffee table books. Everything else was more than we could've imagine. Decoration wise 10/10 points. Definitely found inspiration for my next home. <br/><br/>In terms of communication Malou was super responsive despite the fact that she was on vacation herself. Felt horrible about bothering her and despite a little mishap with the door locks her attentiveness and care to our matter was amazing. Thankfully her apartment was an art museum in itself so it didn't feel like time wasted. <br/><br/>Words of advice, it is not too close to city center and it's important to do your research. Being New Yorkers my boyfriend and I decided to walk everything. We averaged an average 9.5 miles walk a day. From the Museumplein we were about 30 mins walking. Again, we enjoyed the walk and are accustomed to it being New Yorkers so it's important to consider it is a bit far from attractions. However, the reason we picked it is because of its close proximity (10-20 mins) via Uber to city center, Ziggo Dome and the Airport which were important for a concert we attended and possibility of running late to airport. <br/><br/>All in all, do give Malou and her beautiful home a chance! We definitely would love to come back and stay here. Thank you for being a wonderful host Malou! "
47688834,"Marcel (and his sister Jolly) were a wonderful hosts, marcel's house is awesome! We were travelling with 2 kids and the house was incredible for them! We recomend it to everyone who travels to Amsterdam. If we come back, be sure we will repeat!!! Thanks Marcel!!! "
47790474,"Wij logeerde bij Olaf met 3 personen. Bij aankomst werden we hartelijk ontvangen en werd ons koffie, soep, warme stroopwafels aangeboden.  Prima verblijf, vlak bij de Albert Cuijp markt. Echt een super adres. Bedankt Olaf."
47840587,"Quel superbe séjour nous avons passé ! Je suis allée pour la première fois à Amsterdam avec une amie et grâce à Maike et Caspar nous avons passé 4 jours géniaux. <br/>Nous avons été accueillies par Maike qui nous a tout expliqué en français, ce qui est très appréciable ! La chambre est vraiment agréable tant par son aménagement que par sa localisation; au bord de l'eau avec vue sur les bateaux. Le matin, nous n'avions qu'à ouvrir la porte pour y découvrir notre copieux petit déjeuner digne d'un hôtel déposé sur le buffet face à la chambre. <br/>Le rez de chaussée était entièrement pour nous ce qui laisse une grande liberté n'empêchant pas le contact avec nos hôtes. Ces derniers ont 2 chiens adorables. <br/>La maison est assez simple à trouvé lorsque l'on suit les indications précises fournies par Maike sur le site. Même si elle est un peu excentrée de la ville, cela rend les alentours plus agréables sans les bruits urbains. <br/>Je recommande cette chambre et adresse un dernier merci à Maike et Caspar pour leur accueil ! "
47859336,"Toetsie was a great host, met us at the door, and  spent time<br/>talking with us, orientating us to Amsterdam.  <br/>Was kind to accept me and my 2 adult children on short notice, <br/>when other plans failed.   <br/>Toetsie lives up stairs,so is easily contacted.

47961250,Tutto fantastico

48158137,"This was probably my most favorite Airbnb! The proximity to Central Station and city center couldn't be better. The apartment is clean, and has all the amenities you'll need. We were concerned that street noise would be a problem, but it was surprisingly quiet and had no issues sleeping. I will definitely be staying here again."
48200594,"Toetsie was a marvelous host! From the moment we arrived, she welcomed us warmly into her home. She was available throughout our stay for help and to chat. The neighborhood is lovely! Ooh, and she provided some very nice breakfast tidbits for us! "
48296856,"We had a lovely stay at David’s apartment, David was very kind and helpful! We arrived very late at night and David left us clear instructions on how to get the key and let ourselves in and left us a heated room which was great because it was really cold outside! The apartment is very clean and very organized. Its located very central and just 5 min. walk from Amsterdam Central station. Its amazing central location is also its disadvantage- was a bit noisy during weekends nights..<br/><br/>Thank you David very much for making our stay so lovely!<br/>"
48353704,"The place was very cool. Went there with 15 guys for a stag weekend and it was a perfect retreat. Loads of space, interesting decor, very good fun place to be. As per the map, the location is not city centre but it is also not far at all. If I did it again, I would have hired bikes as what is probably only a 5 minute ride away is a 5 minute free ferry 24hrs a day. Highly recommend. In the build up Taco was very helpful and the cleaning ladies were fab too."
48419755,"As a Chinese I'd like to say：这是我在阿姆斯特丹最棒的体验!Petra一家人特别友善，并且他们为自己身为阿姆斯特丹的市民而自豪，很热心的为我们提供帮助。<br/>As a student from Deutschland: Das Haus gefällt mir mega gut! Petra ist sehr freundlich, und sie hat uns viel geholfen. Die Küche und Toilette sind ganz sauber.<br/>I felt so pleased to stay in this kind of perfect place, I love the color here and the room, the kitchen, the bathroom are all clean and comfortable. Before the sun goes down and after you wake up, you can hear the birds singing from the outside. Such a cutie room!! I just want to say I'll choose Petra's house when I come back. And the host: Patre, she is very warm hearted and helped me bought the tickets of Keukenhof. Of cause her family members are easy to get along with too. Choose this house will be great!REALLY!!<br/>Suri<br/>"
48423946,"La estadía fue un placer. Matthijs es muy pero muy atento. Se esfuerza en solucionar todos los problemas y está siempre a disposición. <br/>El departamento está excelentemente ubicado, en el corazón de Amsterdam. El desayuno es en una de las mejores pastelerías de Amsterdam, muy abundante y muy rico, todo casero (hasta te queda un sandwich para el almuerzo)<br/>Tomar en cuenta las recomendaciones de Matthijs, tales como dónde ir al súper, cuál bote tomar para el paseo en canales. <br/>Recomiendo altamente alojarse aquí, no se van a arrepentir!"
48424812,It is a really nice and clean room and the host is really friendly. He is an outstanding artist，photographier. We really recommend this room.
48467327,"Our flight to Amsterdam was delayed so my friend and I went to Mike's apartment very late at night but Mike was very helpful and prepared. The direction he gave us is accurate and his place is very easy to find. Mike also helped us carried our luggage and sharing some information about the area. On the last day, we could leave our luggage with him after we checked out and picked up them later before our departure to the airport. <br/><br/>The apartment is fantastic. It looks exactly like in the photo and fully equipped with every little thing you need. The bed was so comfy, warm and big enough for two. The small kitchen also has it all: you can cook almost everything in there. Mike also prepared  some fruits, tea, coffee, eggs, butter and jam etc. The shower room is quite small but clean and convenience. <br/><br/>Another thing that we really love is the location ""de pijp"". It's packed of restaurants, chic cafes and stores. the Apartment is right in front of the Sarphatipark, so you can take a walk in a sunshine day. It's also easy to access to other parts of the city by tram no. 4 as well as in the walking distance to Museumplein. <br/><br/>Overall, we had such a wonderful time in Amsterdam and we have to admit that Mike's apartment is one of our best memories there. "
48496318,Mike was great host. He provided us with everything we needed. The flat is very nice and large enough for a couple or two persons. The location is great next to the city only 10mins from the centre.
48526540,"This apartment was beautifully decorated and very comfortable. Lidia was very welcoming and thoughtful. We enjoyed our stay very much, and found the area lovely. There were some places to go/eat close by, but most tourist attractions required driving or public transportation."
48540392,"Nous avons mon compagnon et moi même, été reçu avec une grande gentillesse par Gabriel. Il nous attendait au seuil de la porte. L'appartement est magnifique exactement comme sur les photos. Gabriel nous a fourni toutes les explications dont nous avons besoin pour passer un agréable weekend. Tout était parfait.<br/>"
48593099,"Very cute little apartment in a nice part of the city. Perfect for a couple. Hein was a great host, full of tips and recommendations so you can make the most of your stay.

48623120,"A Toetsie é uma senhora cinco estrelas. É muito atenciosa, e sempre disposta ajudar para melhor se desfrutar de Amesterdão.<br/><br/>É possível entrar e sair de casa, virtualmente a qualquer hora, sem qualquer problema...<br/><br/>Quando cheguei, tinha o quarto arrumado com tudo limpo. O ambiente da casa é muito bom e relaxante, e fica incrivelmente perto de tudo o que importa!<br/><br/>Chegar ao centro de Amesterdão é fácil e rápido...! Perto desta casa há supermercados e até um parque (bom para fazer jogging)!<br/><br/>Adorei a estadia e estou a pensar em repetir...! Recomendo vivamente a quem queira tranquilidade depois de desfrutar de Amesterdão. "
48638110,"To be honest if I travelled to Amsterdam often I might not write a review as this is the perfect place and space to stay at and I wouldn't want it booked all the time. Best location, quiet and modern room, nice touches like coffee/tea, shampoo, cold water upon arrival. And even though this room is located in the heart of the old quarter and is always busy and noisy with people, tours and boats passing by on the canal it was incredibly quiet as the windows were double paned and with black curtains. When we shut them all noise was blocked out, but when we opened them it was like the city was breathing into our room. What a joy to lay in bed, have a coffee and hear the city come to life below. additionally because of the location we were able to come back to the room for a rest or change of clothes after each of our city adventures. <br/>To make it simple, if David's place is available, book it!! And if/when we return to Amsterdam we will first see if this place is available before looking at flights. "
48665187,"Thanks Wendy offered us a warm home in Amsterdam.<br/>The location is nice, walk distance to many restaurants, supermarkets, parks but still is a quiet and safe place.<br/>The flat is great, all things you need at home are there, especially the kitchen stuffs, perfect kitchen to cook a home meal during journey.<br/>Wendy is very warmhearted to reply all questions in minutes, we really   love this home in Amsterdam."
48726133,"The place was exactly as pictured. David was a great host. Check in/out process was easy. When we arrived the air conditioner was making a noise and he addressed the problem right away. He was also very easy to get ahold of for any questions during our stay. There were lots of maps and tourist info pamphlets available right outside the room. Although we weren't expecting it, we liked how someone came in everyday and changed out the garbage can and towels, a nice extra that made it feel like we were staying in a hotel. The location was excellent if you are wanting somewhere very central near transit and the red light district. While staying here we were able to walk everywhere and only had to take public transit once. We found the area to be very busy and noisy most of the time but once you get inside the windows are extremely sound proof and since the room had air conditioning there wasn't any reason to open the windows so it was very quiet. Overall a comfortable place to stay!"
48740948,"Nice and peaceful place to visit Amsterdam!<br/>The appartment was neat and very well localized. We enjoyed our stay in Amsterdam.<br/><br/>Suggestion: it would be nice to have a place to hang the clothes, and maybe an other chair to share the breakfast? "
48744249,"We have had the best experience! Starting from the booking until up to our stay and departure - David was wonderful, the nicest person ever!The room is beautiful and incredibly clean, we recommend it all the way and can't wait to visit again."
48750849,I had the best stay at Andrea's place. She has been the most welcoming and warm host. Absolutely love the location. Very convenient to get around with the metro. Andrea also has all the wonderful travelling tips. I'd love to come back again! Thank you Andrea :)
48755711,"Amazing !!! <br/>Check-in, the flat, the view, all pur stay!!! <br/>It was my best trip of my life!! <br/>Thank you!! <br/>See you soon!! <br/>"
48834655,"As a first experience renting via AirB&B,Everts place was a perfect start. Apartment is tiptop in order with a great atmosphere in a nice neighbourhood. Evert,eventhough busy,had arranged everything in good order and communication was very friendly,helpful and clear. In all a welcome experience. "
48872714,had a great experience with ingo we arrived late due to flight issues and he was still able to accommodate us. place was awesome and location was amazing.  will definitely stay again.
48892662,房东的老公非常的热情，并且给我们提供了小额的接送服务，房间很温暖并且很干净，这次的住宿我们非常高兴遇见了房东一家
48895672,"Vera's B&B was even lovelier than we expected and she was a fantastic host, really helpful and friendly. The B&B is in a great part of Amsterdam, in a quiet area but walking distance to the centre and there are lots of nice places to eat and drink nearby. I'd definitely stay here again if I come back to Amsterdam."
48967550,"We had a nice weekend at Rosie's, the room was nice and spacious with a juliet balcony and a really comfy bed! We managed to sleep through breakfast both days but Rosie was helpful and tolerate of our late arrival.  About a 15-20 minute tram journey into the centre of town."
49086640,"We stayed with Wendie and Hans for 5 nights. The room is quite nice and right in the middle of Amsterdam. Everything is close by (within a 20 minute walk).<br/><br/>Both of our hosts were extremely helpful (one morning we had fresh muffins at our door) and friendly; supplying a map, telling us where to check out and asking us of our interests to best direct us. They are very knowledgeable of the area.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this apartment and hosts."
49150413,"It couldn't be better!Matthijs is a great host.he was there for us all the time.the Appartement was perfect.its not possible to live more in the center and you could think now,that it must be very loud.but it's the opposite.its so quiet,that we could sleep really great.the room itself is clean,modern and comfortable.you feel like in a hotel,but much better and here is why.the breakfast,that is included,is in a bakery around the corner,that is so beautiful,that you feel like in a movie set.and the breakfast itself was delicious.so all in all: Matthijs will hopefully see us soon again!"
49176909,Remco's apartment is a spectacular duplex. Neatly kept and with all types of commodities and cool stuff. He left an welcome/explanatory note and a map. It was a shame because of the weather but getting home after walking all day with bad weather was just like being at your own place :) I would definitely go again. Also Antonio (Remco's friend) was very helpful during the whole weekend and solved all our issues. 
49199857,"We did not meet Kate. An AirBnB host met us, over 1 hour after the agreed time.<br/>Nice apartment, in convenient location, but need to climb 30 meters of tight narrow stairs. Apartment has no emergency escape if stairway blocked or in case of fire."
49263794,Nous avons été très bien accueillis par Viola! Daniel et elle nous avaient préparés toutes les informations utiles pour découvrir Amsterdam! L'appartement est très agréable et bien situé! On s'y sent comme chez soi! Nous avons donc passé un excellent séjour : merci!
49284570,"We had a great time at Marks studio, he was there to meet us and show us around and then was happy to leave us to our stay fit the rest of the weekend. The studio is bright and spacious. The 'kitchen' would benefit from a toaster and some big mugs, but was otherwise adequately equipped. The shower room and bedroom were great and the TV had English channels, which was great to wake up to in the morning. The location was much better than we had thought it would be and we had a pleasant walk in each morning. We would absolutely return to the studio and will be recommending to friends! "
49326818,I was only able to stay for one night here but I wish I could have stayed longer!  Marga was extremely helpful and friendly and the room was lovely!  I highly recommend staying here :)
49386853,"Unfortunately we didn't meet Pim, as he was away himself. But he left the keys with a friend of his, and Mare showed us the apartment briefly and also gave information about the city. The apartment itself is lovely, very close to the city center and in a quiet neighborhood. The apartment has everything you could want, with a modern kitchen. Pim went out of his way to make us feel at home. Would be more than willing to come back and stay in this exact apartment."
49406560,The guesthouse is really good and the family was really nice to me. Quietly neighbours. I did enjoy my holiday there.
49432219,"David was a perfect host! He made sure we were settled in and had everything we needed. The room was perfectly located in the heart of Amsterdam, everything is near and so we were able to walk everywhere. I will absolutely be staying here again when I'm next in Amsterdam "
49512039,"My girlfriend and I had a great time at Annet and Dave's charming house. Situated 15 minutes away from Central Station (with the tram), we were close to everything. And at the same time, this house is the perfect calm and isolated house for people who want to chill out out of the city uproar.<br/>In other words, we had a great time, and can only recommend it!<br/>Small thing: we were not told there was a cat before arriving. So, if you are allergic, be aware!"
49520221,"Vielen Dank für die außergewöhnlich herzliche Gastfreundschaft. Für unser Wochenende in Amsterdam hätten wir keine bessere Unterkunft buchen können. Das Appartement liegt wunderschön am Hafen, im Souterrain eines historischen, Amsterdam typischen Hauses und ist sehr gepflegt. Die historische Altstadt ist einfach zu Fuß zu erreichen. Ganz in der Nähe ist eine schöne Einkaufsstraße mit Bars, Restaurants, Supermarkt, Bäckerei und kleinen Geschäften für frischen Fisch, Fleisch und Käse. Das Frühstück liebevoll von Laura oder Arjan in das Appartement gebracht kann also mit regionalen Spezialitäten im Restaurant um die Ecke oder per Selbstverpflegung mit regionalen Spezialitäten erweitert werden. Die Küche ist komplett ausgestattet (incl. Geschirrspüler). Wir haben die kostenfrei zur Verfügung stehenden Fahrräder genutzt. Nichts ist schöner als in Amsterdam Rad zu fahren. Fragt nach dem Flughafen Service. Komfortabler als mit Arjans Luxus Shuttle Service kann man die Reise nicht beginnen oder beenden. Es war schön bei Euch wir kommen gern wieder."
49611676,"We had a fantastic stay at Davids apartment, it was in an amazing location, super central, and was really clean and tidy. it had everything that we needed in it, including lots of tea! it had air con and heating which was good because we were freezing outside! Would 100% stay here again when we next visit amsterdam! David even let us keep our suitcases in his hallway on our last day after our check out time because our flight wasn't until later that night. Brilliant host. "
49623820,"住宿地點位置不難找到～但實際上與照片上有點落差,廚房的碗盤通常房東用完不會收拾乾淨。我們早上七點多醒來,到廚房煮早餐(泡麵),房東說我們已經吵到她了～房東條款上沒有說早上不能使用廚房,選擇有廚房的房源一般來說都希望能在家做東西吃再出門,房東希望大概八九點比較好,不過通常旅人比較早起出門～所有整體上沒有那麼的方便"
49725067,"Many thanks to our hosts Daniel and Viola for making our stay so wonderful! We can really recommend them, these two are lovely persons that do everything to make you love the city of Amsterdam as much as they do. <br/>The flat is super cosy with beautiful interior and really everything you need! The neighborhood is calm and super nice. Supermarket, bus and tram are reached within a few minutes walking. <br/>Our stay here was simply too short - next time we stay more! "
49737634,"Raul's place was lovely. Highly recommend it. Great location. Less than 5 minutes away from city center. Raul and his nephew provided everything we needed for the weekend and more. Whenever I am back in Amsterdam, I will definitely see if his place is available again."
49794116,We really enjoyed our trip to Amsterdam and our stay in Mikes apartement! <br/>It was easy to find and super comfortable. It doesn't take you a lot of time to get to the center and there are many bars and restaurants close to the apartement. <br/>Mike is a friendly and helpful person. We'd love to come back someday! 
49823943,"Nous avons passé un séjour extra à Amsterdam, et le logement a sa part de contribution , sans aucun doute ! Nous avons été très très bien accueilli et dans la joie par Micha. Malgré mon Anglais moyen, l'hôte sait très bien se faire comprendre. Il a été très arrangeant, et avions pu récupérer les clefs pour 8h du matin, ainsi que déposer nos affaires dans un coin du logement le temps que le ménage soit terminé pour 11h. Le logement est en adéquation parfaite avec ce que nous recherchions : pas chère, pas loin et convivial! <br/>Nous avons tout particulièrement aimé :<br/>- le petit déjeuné <br/>- les 2 balcons <br/>- les canapés<br/>- et le fauteuil ! Et quel fauteuil! Si confortable !! <br/>Une chose est sûre, Micha nous reverra un jour! <br/>Thanks for all! "
49890749,It's a great place to visit Amsterdam. Wilfried and his family are very friendly. The advices that Wilfried gave us allowed to spend good time. The house was very comfortable and our children were happy to take care the cat. we recommend warmly !
49977311,"Thank you, Toetsie, again, for a wonderful stay in your home, and for all your amazing generosity, friendliness, advice, and long chats over dinner and cold nights. The phrase ""home from home"" is overused, but it certainly applies here. Thanks also to Roky for allowing me to share his space and welcoming me in again...cos cats actually rule the world, see. <br/><br/>I shall return! But in the meantime - thank you so much xx"
49992343,"Marga was a great host. She was very welcoming and helped a lot picking me up at the train station. The guest house was very nice, quaint, and exactly as shown in the pictures. Marta's family was also m very nice. I would recommend a stay in this garden near the water :)"
50021225,"Laura and her husband were fantastic!  They made us feel so welcome, the place was immaculate, and being greeted with a lovely breakfast each morning was fantastic.  I highly recommend this place!"
50103253,"N'hésitez pas à entrer dans l'univers d'Olaf, vous ne le regretterez pas. Olaf est très sympathique, présent mais discret. Il parle très bien français. L'appartement est bien et haut en couleur, situé dans un quartier très calme et proche du centre ville (accessible à pied et proche des transports publics et des locations de vélo). Nous avons particulièrement apprécié le roof top qui donne une belle vue sur la ville. Merci encore à Olaf pour ses conseils.<br/>Attention : pour ceux qui viennent en voiture, se garer dans la rue est hors de prix. Privilégiez les parking relais (P+R) à la périphérie (nous avons opté pour celui du stade olympique) mais surtout, éditez la procédure à suivre pour ne pas payer plein pot..."
50181215,"Micha is a great host! He was very friendly and gave us some helpful tipps. The appartement is good located, clean and roomy! With two sleeping rooms, a kitchen , two balconies and a living room you have many space to use! We enjoyed our stay and would come back again! Thanks again, Micha!"
50185203,"We had a lovely 1-night stay at Rosie's. The neighborhood is pretty quiet and a bit far from the center by foot, but close to the Museum district. If you're looking for a bit of respite while exploring the city, it's a great fit. <br/>Rosie had all the amenities and the bed is *great*! One thing to note: the bedroom is one of two for rent on the top floor, so the bathroom is shared. <br/>Rosie made sure that we had everything that we needed; however, in our experience, the check-in time was rather inflexible which meant we had to find a place to store our things during the day. <br/>Overall, highly recommend and would stay at Rosie's again! "
50197936,"Accoglienza piacevole, Klaartje si è rivelata un host gentile e disponibile. La casa è confortevole, il quartiere è ricco di locali ed è comodo al centro! "
50332336,Remco made us feel very welcomed! The apartment was in a decent location. It was very clean and identical to the pictures shown. Although the wifi was not working and did not get fixed our entire stay. 
50345524,"A superb apartment next to the Amstel river furnished to a very high standard. Marieke was very welcoming and helped us get the most from our stay by preparing an excellent guide to the area as well as giving personal recommendations, which we took full advantage of. It was so great having 2 bikes to explore the city on too.<br/>A beautiful, retro style apartment run by the most helpful host! We will definitely be returning :) Jon and Romy<br/>"
50385983,"Non abbiamo mai incontrato Roman, in ogni caso, le sue indicazioni sono state efficaci e precise. L'appartamento è molto bello, molto pulito, vicino ai mezzi pubblici ed al centro città. Lo consiglio senza nessun dubbio.<br/>"
50458670,"The room I stayed in was really lovely and I managed to have a very relaxing nights sleep after a tough week. The very late checkout time of 12:00 was also perfect for me. Furthermore, an easy tram connection to Dam Square makes the city very accessible. Daniela was also an exceptionally helpful host and gave me several good recommendations. The only downside is that there is a considerable amount of noise from the street, but I guess that is mostly a given in big cities."
50495362,The space is cozy and perfect and centrally located.
50516191,"The furniture was new and the apartment very clean. The location close to Leidseplein is perfect. The bed is very comfortable. Inconveniant alone, there are some water drainage problems in the shower and sink. Otherwise everything was perfect and the welcome at the agency was very friendly. Very good apartment!"
50581563,"The studio is beautiful and the host of great help with many maps and recommendations concerning visits and restaurants.<br/>The studio is slightly cold in winter and the kitchen is very basic: only a fridge and microwave, no oven or hobs. Also most sounds from the above flat can be heard and I guess the opposite is also true (not ideal if you are looking for absolute privacy).<br/><br/>Thank you very mich for your kind welcome and your help!"
50639367,"Unfortunately, we've had a very bad experience. The house is completely disappointed us. Immediately after that examination we left it and went to live in the hotel. The pictures on the website and the impression is completely not consistent with each other. Also present were the terrible smell, which completely eliminated the possibility of our stay there."
50720912,"Sleep in a Island boat was a nice experience.  The main badroom was really cozy , bright and with the view of the river outside , you can forget the tiredness of our long walking tour in Amsterdam. The place was quite, We didn't cook inside but seems equiped for. The house boat is about 20 min by tram (nr 26) and 10 min walking from the central station.<br/>Bob is a good owner, friendly, available.<br/>We definitely enjoyed our long weekend ! Thnks"
50731908,"Remco is a wonderful host, who explains exactly what you need and cares about your experience.<br/>The flat: beautiful! you will have the best time <br/>The location: very good. cosy neighborhood,and very close to the city center with the tram 4.<br/>"
50830882,"My friend and I had a wonderful stay on Hanneke's house boat! It was was such a unique experience and we were pleasantly surprised by how much space we had. Hanneke was so friendly and helpful, and even left us a welcome gift of wine and snacks. I would definitely stay here again on another trip to Amsterdam!"
50904136,"Heel erg bedankt voor het vriendelijke onthaal! We werden heel goed ingelicht over de bezienswaardigheden en leuke plekjes om te eten.  De ligging is dan ook ideaal om te voet of met het openbaar vervoer alles te verkennen.<br/>Het was fijn dat Marijn ons ook nog fietsen  ter beschikking stelde  hoewel die, gezien hun niet zo jonge leeftijd, niet zo makkelijk te berijden waren. Dit plekje is een aanrader!"
50958849,Thanks to Marga and her family for welcoming me for my short stay and even coming to look for me when i took a wrong turn. A lovely room in a quiet area next to the Amstel with friendly hosts. Quick response to any queries through email. I hope to return for a longer trip in the future! Thank you
51026929,"Virginia and her husband are very nice and generous, even offering a free breakfast. I needed a simple place to stay and this worked great, at an excellent price. Only one thing - the unit smells slightly smoky, but it wasn't an issue for me."
51057678,"Wij hadden een heerlijk weekend aan boord van the Boreas. Prettige ontvangst door Grietje die zelfs met ons meereed tot aan de gratis parkeergelegenheid (aan de andere kant van de oever en door de gratis vertoond perfect te bereiken), ook leuke tips gekregen over cafeetjes en eetgelegenheden in de buurt. The Boreas is een prachtige boot met heel gezellige eetruimte en prima uitgeruste keuken."
51153257,"Perfect location. Perfect accommodations. Perfect host. We just finished a three night visit. Staying in a house boat on a canal was a special experience. The boat itself was clean, warm and cozy. All the amenities worked as expected.  The boat was located on a very quiet canal but also within a 15 minute walk of many of  the museums. There were some great restaurants nearby as well. Mark was the perfect host - always available but never intrusive. We would definitely book again when in Amsterdam. "
51256397,"Casa molto pulita che rispecchia perfettamente l presentazione fotografica, host molto disponibile e cordiale. Consigliatissima!"
51331021,"Beautiful apartment in front of the gorgeous Vondelpark. We had an amazing time and will absolutely come back to this very apartment. <br/>Jean-Paul was super helpful and gave us the perfect start to this weekend - very very nice guy. <br/>Would absolutely recommend this apartment (perfect location, perfect apartment and perfect hosts). <br/>The only thing one might have to add (for slightly older guests or those with hip issues) is that one has to get up three floors with very steep stairs ;) - apart from that: BOOK it!!"
51346346,"Une bonne adresse à 2 pas du centre ville, dans un immeuble typiquement hollandais. Sur le petit espace au 2nd étage, 1 chambre avec un lit simple, une kitchenette, une salle de douche, 1 wc, 1 seconde chambre avec un lit double et un petit salon. Toetsie et charmante, réactive par mail, fait tout pour nous faciliter le séjour, et son kit de bienvenue est adorable !"
51354088,"Beautiful place, the house is very cool with an amazing garden. the neighbourhood is very nice and well connected!<br/>The experience was excellent, Frank was a great host he receive us with fantastic white wine and exquisite traditional waffles!<br/>"
51585389,"Just amazing. Situated on a charming canal , 5 min walk from all the attraction. Ingo and Marlies are amazing people . It was a great experience , just try it and you ll see for yourself. "
51613624,"Great location, close to city centre and metro station. This apartment was perfect for our stay and we just loved it. Hein was really friendly and interesting, he showed us some of his work, which was awesome to see. Besides, he gave us useful advice to see Amsterdam off the beaten path. Would like to stay there again if we go back."
51646327,"Marks apartment is in a great location, only a short walk away from the local market and the supermarket. It was very easy for us to get into the centre of Amsterdam via bicycle but there is plenty to see and do nearby the apartment. The apartment was great and exactly how it is portrayed in the pictures. We took full advantage of the kitchen space and really felt at home. I highly recommend staying at marks apartment, we loved the area and the apartment and will definitely be back! "
51658108,"Such great hosts and a lovely place too! Very roomy. Comfy bed, accessible and organized kitchen.. Lots of natural light which brightens up the whole house. Also, a peaceful neighborhood within walking distance of the transport and not too far from a local supermarket and  some restaurants. Only downside was it felt a bit far from the center of Amsterdam ( took an average 20-25 min by tram to get anywhere).<br/>Other than that-- A great place all around! "
51690928,"Remco was a wonderful host. His apartment is really spacious and has some nice features. His house is located in a central place near ""De Pijp"", a really nice place especially for young people. In just 10 minutes you'll get in the center of Amsterdam. The next train station is just 300 m away and brings you directly to the center. "
51823038,"El apartamento es hermoso, la cama es cómoda y el wifi anda perfecto. Hubo una noche sola que fue bastante ruidosa por la zona, pero vale la ubicación y vista al canal que tiene. No conocí a Dan, pero la persona a cargo era muy amable y atento. Esperemos volver...."
51847049,"The place is close to city center, great location. When I got there the cousin was there not the main host but she was super nice & helped me a lot. I'd definitely go to the same place in future. "
51884132,"Leuke kamer, fantastische buurt! Heerlijk groot bad. Er werd aan kleine attenties gedacht zoals badzout, badroosjes, verse bloemen, drinken en een versnapering. Ook leuk dat er oordopjes klaar lagen omdat de geburen aan het werken waren. Ik heb de oordopjes echter niet daarvoor nodig gehad, maar voor het geluid van vallende druppels  in een leiding de hele nacht, aan het hoofdeinde. De kussens waren ook minder ons ding, daardoor niet zo lekker geslapen. Debby geeft ook een leuke adresjes mee in de buurt om iets te eten/drinken, fijn!"
51891548,"Leuk huisje in de tuin van de ark waar Marga en haar gezin woont. Ik was er maar kort maar voelde me meteen op mijn gemak. Heb er een dol""fijne"" nacht doorgebracht. <br/><br/>Tot een volgende keer! "
51893589,"Jakob, Patricia, and their family made us feel very welcome in Amsterdam. Patricia gave us information on a number of places to visit during our stay, including an amazing restaurant across the road. The apartment was very clean and had a functioning kitchenette, which we used daily. The courtyard was a nice place to relax. Everything appeared as it is represented in the images. However, there was no washer or dryer as it was advertised. <br/>All in all it was a pleasant stay "
51910069,"Very nice experience with Edwin, very friendly and the house si near to everything "
51925573,"My first Airbnb experience and what a splendid experience it was. I was staying on my own in this lovely, warm basement flat. Very cosy and well appointed with everything you could need for a short stay. Bed particularly comfortable and the shower a delight. Add to this its position alongside a canal in a quieter part of the city but with easy access to public transport and only a 25 minute walk to Dam Square and other historic places. The breakfast  was considerably more than adequate and pleasantly delivered at the time requested. Finally Laura was most welcoming, helpful and charming which topped this exceptional BnB."
52041361,True Amsterdam exsperience. <br/>Exactly what I was searching for when I choose this romantic situation. <br/>The breakfast is amazing and the houseboat is really cute.<br/>The silence ok the docks in the morning when you have breakfast in me. Luctor is really precious.<br/>Thanks to Flip for the ospitality!
52055829,"Micha was a wonderful host! He made sure we comfortably settled down upon arrival, explained how everything works and recommended places to visit in Amsterdam. He came by the flat everyday to do a little cleaning and even stocked up on groceries for us! The flat is big enough for 6 people, very spacious and had everything that we needed. Also, there is a grocery store (Lidl) one metro station away (Ajax stadium) which has really cheap groceries and convenient for us to shop. We really enjoyed our stay at this flat. "
52089158,"Endroit original pour passer un excellent moment romantique et pittoresque. <br/>Nous avons adoré le séjour ! <br/>Le bateau est dans la campagne. Ça a le mérite d'être calme et proche de la nature, mais le désavantage d'être isolé de la ville... <br/>Nous vous conseillons les petits déjeuners de Annelieke. Ils sont à tomber par terre, rien de mieux pour débuter la journée ! <br/>Attention, pour ceux qui ont des problèmes de dos comme moi, le lit est mou, voire très mou... <br/>A recommander pour une expérience nouvelle ! "
52120077,"Todo perfecto, tal y como aparece en las fotos (flores frescas incluídas). El barco está perfectamente acondicionado y organizado. Nosotros estuvimos 15 personas y en ningún momento nos sentimos agobiados, Los anfitriones son encantadores y resolvieron todas nuestras dudas. Muy bien comunicado con el centro. En fin, una opción magnífica para una estancia en Ámsterdam diferente."
52154991,"We have just returned from a wonderful trip to Amsterdam.  The apartment was wonderful - lovely setting, comfortable and exactly as advertised.  <br/><br/>The breakfast each morning (delivered to our door) was so nice.  Cheese, breads, jam, eggs, fruit and the nicest freshly squeezed orange juice. <br/><br/>Arjan collected us from Schipol on our arrival and brought us directly to the apartment.  No reading  maps and trying to find our way.  Brilliant.<br/><br/>We can highly recommend this Airbnb.  <br/><br/>Buckleys"
52179799,"Rosie was an excellent, welcoming hostess and very easy to get ahold of, and was eager to pass on information to improve my time in Amsterdam. The space was clean and just as advertised, within easy walking distance of public transit. I would absolutely recommend staying here!"
52270461,"While the space was very nice and accurate to the pictures, we got the feeling we were renting a room in someone's house, not an entire apartment. Especially because she checked up on us which we were not expecting from a private apartment. Macha was extremely friendly, but she had us sign in with our passports which was uncomfortable and apparently is an air bnb procedure, but we have never experienced that in the 10+ air bnbs we've stayed in. Macha did let us keep our bags in the apartment much later than check out time which was very nice and accommodating for us. Also while it says shampoo is included, we could not find it. Overall it was a great stay. The view was very nice and for a weekend it covered all the necessities. Seems expensive for renting one single room, but that may just be Amsterdam real estate. I would definitely still recommend for the right person visiting Amsterdam. "
52295391,"It was nice to stay at Alexander's home. Such an amazing experience. Feel like home. If you love to have a good breakfast every morning, its a good choice because his mother is an excellent cook. Except its somehow hard to turn warm water in the bathroom, everything was perfect. Highly recommended!"
52366731,The place was in a good location. 
52480306,It was really nice.
52624343,"The apartment was lovely and clean when we arrived, and the charismatic cleaning lady promptly poured us a glass of wine :D. The apartment looked as advertised and was situated in a nice neighbourhood. We spent half a day strolling around the Jordaan and it was definitely worth it. Also worth noting, the apartment was warm! This was particularly appreciated in the cold, wet January weather. There were also lots of books and maps about Amsterdam in the flat, which made planning our trip really easy. Thanks again Martijn!"
52649626,Apartment was perfect for what we wanted. Host greeted us and explained everything we needed to know. Would recommend staying here. Would go again 
52687268,Amstel 41 may possibly be my favorite AirBnB ever! The space is excellent and very good location right near the canal not far from city center. Arriving to property was very easy via metro. The space is very comfortable and has all the amenities anyone could be looking for. HIGHLY recommended for anyone/couple looking for a cool place to stay in Amsterdam!
52701344,Very cosy place and extremely welcoming people. Listing description is reliable and accurate. Thank you for your hospitality!
52725693,"We had a great stay in Amsterdam. Monique had great communication before and during our stay. She provided us with a book with bus schedules, maps, and attractions. The flat was beautiful with the biggest most comfortable bed ever! The location was wonderful and quiet. And a quick bus ride sent us to downtown Amsterdam! We would recommend this family and flat to anyone traveling to Amsterdam. Thank you so much for our stay. It was a great end to our vacation! "
52739850,"nous avons passé un super séjour à Amsterdam ! En couple pour fêter nos 10 ans ensemble, 30 ans tous les 2.<br/>David a été parfait. Accueillant, disponible et discret. Chambre très jolie, propre très bien située. Superbe vue de la fenêtre et gare à 3 min à pied.<br/> Bouilloire, frigo, sèche cheveux, serviettes, couverts, tv, douche et toilettes dans la chambre et accès indépendant depuis la rue comme si vous aviez votre propre appartement ! En fait rien à redire ! Même la météo a été de la partie.<br/>Merci à David, car c'était  notre premier airbnb ! On recommence quand ? :-)"
52794525,"Virginia and Darius were awesome hosts! They are very chill and friendly people as well as her cousin Lena! I would highly recommend anyone visiting Amsterdam to stay here. They were very kind, helpful and accommodating hosts! They were knowledgeable and willing to help about transit in Amsterdam and tips on attractions. They were so nice as to include me in their plans and truly make you feel at home offering to use their home as your own! The place was exactly as described and I have no complaints what so ever!  Being only a short walk from Centraal Station it is the ideal place to explore all the fun Amsterdam has to offer! If I could give more than 5 stars I would! Enjoy your trip back home in July!! "
52828617,Jeroen was an excellent host. He spent time giving us numerous recommendations for what to do around Amsterdam. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay in Amsterdam! 
52924104,"Excellent welcoming, the flat is extremely well located (walking distance from both the museums and the city centre), tidy, clean and well suited for both a couple and a single person. Hein is a great guy ! Bonus: There is a supermarket at the corner if one wants to cook. We strongly and warmly recommend that place !!!!!!!"
52925846,"My girlfriend and I were lucky enough to spend a week staying in Malou's beautiful flat and had a great time exploring Amsterdam from it!  <br/><br/>Although Malou was unable to meet us in person, she made arrangements to allow us to pick up the keys and be shown around the flat and kindly left a bottle of wine for us to enjoy on our first night! <br/><br/>The flat was exceptionally clean and tidy, as well as being beautifully decorated with a well appointed kitchen which allowed us to cook for ourselves.  Malou provided an information sheet with some local highlights and helpful tips regarding the flat and Amsterdam itself.  Outside there is a lovely covered seating area with candles and fairy lights where we spent a lot of our time.<br/><br/>The flat was conveniently located, allowing us to walk to the inner canal belt within 20-25 minutes and once we had hired bikes we managed to get into town within 10.  The Vondelpark is close by (5 mins or so by bike).  The Foodhallen nearby was a great place to eat.<br/><br/>The whole experience was great and thanks to Malou we had an excellent time.  We'd love to stay again when we next return to Amsterdam and would recommend this AirBnB to anyone!<br/><br/>Thank you so much for having us!"
52934956,"Hein no solo nos nos mostro como conocer Amsterdan. Tambien nos enseño y compartió sus conocimiento sobre la vida. Gracias Hein por compartir tu casa y todo lo que nos has compartido. No lo duden si van a Amsterdam la casa de Hein es la mejor opcion. Nos llevamos tu luz en tu creacion!!! <br/>Te queremos Hein.<br/>El mejor departamento. Cerca de todo y Hein siempre presente. <br/>Gracias gracias gracias "
52937239,"It was a very pleasant stay. Susan has welcomed us in a nice flat with a cosy atmosphere and two adorable cats. <br/>Also the surrounding area was instead of the city very green so i think its quite nice to stay there in spring/summer."
53020139,"Our experience was really nice, the room was beautiful, cozy and really clean (the bed was so comfortable), it was also located in the city center, so it was easy to reach everything. David was really nice and a good host. "
53105182,"The room was fantastic because it was located in a very good location, and the insides were very well furnished. The canal views are a great plus, don't think you can get such a combination in other options. <br/><br/>Host was helpful and had ample information for tourist spots, etc. "
53154609,"Great place, loved the feel and atmosphere of it. Close enough to the city to go see the sights but far enough to get a decent nights sleep. "
53169988,"Thanks for making my first airBnB a delight, Toetsie!  Everything was perfect from the welcome wine to the company of the cat!<br/>If I'm in Amsterdam again, I'll be back."
53179617,"The hosts were lovely and were very welcoming when we arrived. I had requested a cake for my partner as it was his birthday, and they organised for a beautiful (delicious!) cake to be in the fridge of the room on arrival. The accommodation is cosy and very clean, with lots of beautiful art on the walls. Brilliant location too - I walked to and from central Amsterdam many times. There is also a fantastic coffee selection! Thank you for a wonderful stay, we will recommend you to our friends!"
53327177,Excellent week-end!!! Appartement très agréable ( spacieux et propre) et très bien situé!!! Roman est un très bon hôte 
53439496,"It's a good place, the environment is quiet and the room is cozy. You can easily take bus 34 there, which will drive you to the city center.<br/>Jeroen is a nice guy, he is pleased to give you all the trip tips there, and you can rent his bikes.<br/>Enjoy your trip there:)"
53595679,"This place is great and Marga is terrific host. She is very helpful and full of energy. Though i stayed at her place for just a single night but had enough opportunity to not only meet and know Marga but to her family as well. The whole family is very welcoming and place is very unique compared to modern day establishments, you will be amazed to gaze at the sky on a starry night just outside your place from the garden. The location is pretty good to access the trams and city without any hassles, it's quiet and safe in there even if you walk midnight in the street. Margas' houseboat is awesome and it feels really good when you are in there.I recommend this place for staying and will try to stay there whenever i visit Amsterdam. <br/>Yogesh"
53627300,"This was the best airBnB I've ever stayed in. The privacy, cleanliness and helpfulness of Gabriel was beyond amazing. The apartment was very modern, extremely clean and very comfortable. Had great amenities.  It's a 10 min Metro ride to downtown Amsterdam, a little walking, but very easy. Highly recommend."
53654870,"We dont happy with the house especially with the host.<br/>She entered the home without our permission last  nigh. And the night before she had also try to enter home.<br/>We didnt have any privacy<br/>After we left the home, her toilet has broken. She blamed us to broke it even we didnt do anything<br/>The apartment is flattened. And she didnt let us to use the garden. But at the photos there is a garden"
53655747,If you are looking to stay at this apatment do yourself a favor and look no more .Just book it straight away. We stayd there for 6 days and the only incovenients was that we had to leave. I use to live in Amsterdam and this trip was a holiday wth my family and this apartment is the best. Its cosy cute modern rustic and as central it can be. Lets say everything is a max 20 minute walk away. The neighboorhood is very nice. Quiet at nite and yet central. The view of the canal is awesome right next to a bridge. I invited some dutch family members of mine for a evening dinner and they were all very impressed. Roman unfortunatly was not there because he was busy wth work but it was as if he was present by instant responding to any question we had. On our next trip to Amsterdam we will keep our fingers cross for this apartment to be available. Stayd for 6 days and it was fantastic. Great location beautifull apartment walkable to everywere. On the canals fantastic view. Roman was fantastic and very helpful to any questions we had. Highly recommended.
53691415,"Was an amazing time at Amsterdam, the location it's great in a beautiful neighbourhood!"
53719471,"Warm, clean and incredibly comfortable. My daughter (14) and I have just enjoyed four nights staying in this lovely apartment in a really calm, beautiful and historic part of the city.  It has been really special to be able to stay in a part of Amsterdam we would not have experienced if we had not tried Airbnb. I can't imagine we will ever stay in a hotel again.  It was really easy to walk to the centre of the city past the house boats, the city farm, the yellow submarine, the lovely little shops, fantastic healthy food shop, cafes and restaurants. We would recommend Laura and her extended family as hosts without reservation. "
53730622,"Photos don't really do the flat justice, this is a brilliant flat - equipped with all mod-cons,  plenty of room, very accommodating and friendly hosts - what more could you need? Thanks for making it a great stay :-)"
53805103,"Ottimo appartamento, dietro l'heineken experience. Il luogo in cui è situato l'appartamento consente tramite tram o bici, di poter accedere a tutte le particolari e magnifiche vie di Amsterdam.<br/>L'appartamento in se è ottimo e spazioso per 4 persone con un'ampia cucina e un discreto bagno.<br/>Locale climatizzato, l'unica pecca quella macchina del caffè che si vede dalle foto, non sono riuscito a prendermi un buon caffè (sotto casa ci sono bar,attività e coffe shop, quindi non è indispensabile).<br/>In definitiva consiglio questo appartamento sia a gruppi di ragazzi ma anche a famiglie."
53809297,"Thank you for your hospitality and thinking along upfront, making sure we got the room that best suited our wishes. Clear communication and a wonderful attitude that aims to please and provide a perfect stay. Wonderful location near the beautiful Vondelpark. Easy to reach the Museumkwartier and head into the city from there on. We can recommend this to anyone."
53882657,"We had a great time here!!<br/>The location: Super convenient 10 minute walk from the public transportation stations!! We had no problem accessing all areas of Amsterdam<br/>The space: The room, bathroom and patio were amazing. Nicest airbnb space i've ever stayed at. Just to note, the shower and toilet are in the same room as the bed, just separated by a curtain and swinging door.<br/>The people: Stef and his wife Angela were so nice. They welcomed us and assisted us with whatever we needed, welcomed us every time we entered and exited.<br/>Overall we were very impressed by Stef and his place and would DEFINITELY stay here if we return to Amsterdam."
53908893,"Ralf Thank you for your hospitality and your confiance. The apartment is beautiful and unusual with its roof terrace and mezzanine .Very well located in the center 5 minutes from the dam site and in a quiet street away from the noise. Ralf delivered keys on time. I will come back soon thank you for being so welcoming Ralf .<br/><br/>Ralf Merci pour votre hospitalité et votre confiance.l' appartement et superbe et inhabituel avec sa terrasse sur les toits et sa mezzanine .Très bien situé dans le centre à 5 minutes de la place dam et dans une rue calme loin du bruit .remise des clefs à l'heure convenu.je reviendrais très bientôt merci pour ton accueil .a + Ralf.<br/><br/> Merci encore Ralf pour ton accueil et ta ponctualité quoi dire de plus deuxième location et toujours au top plus je vient chez toi et plus j'aime Amsterdam a très bientôt "
53909187,"We spent some great days in Amsterdam and our stay in the apartment was excelent. The apartment is very cozy and clean with a well equipped kitchen. It's very easy to find. The neighbourhood is quiet and it's really close to the center city on foot. The hosts are nice and helpfull, and they suggested us a lot of tips to do in Amsterdam. We would happily recommend their place to our friends!"
53910271,"Great host! Very welcoming and happy to help with any problems! Room was very easy to find and in a great location, minutes away from dam square, red light district and all the shopping, room had everything provided and more, breakfast was amazing and highly recommend going to the cafe provided. host allowed us to have a late check out as our return trip wasn't till later, contact was also very efficient through whattsapp and replied very fast! highly recommended this place and we will definitely be returning on our next trip! "
53927247,"We could not recommend this location enough. It was quiet but close to everything and, in what we believe, was the prettiest area of Amsterdam. <br/>There was a bakery across the road, bike rental around the corner and everything was in walking distance (just quicker by bike) <br/>The bed was very comfortable and the shower had good pressure and was hot. Unfortunately the fridge wasnt working during our stay- but the bakery was amazing!<br/>We made friends with the apartment cat, Shnauts, who was so friendly!<br/>We will be back!"
54017381,"My partner and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Berith's home. She achieved a balance of being very welcoming and helpful, while still respecting our privacy. She was full of suggestions of things to do in Amsterdam, and how to get around the city which was helpful.<br/>The house is decorated nicely, and I am sure that any creative person would really appreciate the art pieces hanging on the walls. Lovely stay overall!"
54023718,"Joke and Gerard are really nice host. I and my girlfriend enjoy our stay very much. The room is perfect with a big window and a comfy bed. We can lay on the bed and enjoy the fantastic view over the water. We can see ducklings and even swan in the morning. The bathroom is spacious. Their two cats Nina and Nena are lovely and we love to interact with them. We are quite impressed that Joke and Gerard prepared a little souvenir to us. Though we have two large suitcases, we don't have to worry about it. Joke picked us up in the pier on the first day and sent us to the central station by boat on the day we left. He even bring us for a short boat tour. Greatly recommended!"
54044346,"Bonne organisation lors de notre arrivée,même si notre hôte n' était pas présent.Le quartier était idéalement situé et la chambre parfaite ;spacieuse , très propre et au calme(fidèle à la photographie et au descriptif).Avons passé un excellent séjour à Amsterdam .<br/>Merci à notre hôte ! "
54053189,"Thanks for everything Micha! We had a great time in your apartment, and if we come back to Amsterdam, for sure we'll go to your apartment.<br/>Regards! Best host of the world. He is capable of getting adapted to every situation and he is such a good man that made us feel at home. We will come back! Thanks for all"
54073130,"I wish we were back in Amsterdam! What a beautiful city and a beautiful flat.  Laura's historic flat was the perfect place to stay: warm with a big bed and shower, in a lovely quiet neighbour and a fantastic breakfast to set us up for a day of wandering. It's a wonderful haven. Thanks for making us so comfortable for our babymoon!"
54149296,Great room and hosts
54177915,"<br/>the house was very comfortable and cozy . the neighborhood is very ben statement once you know around the city . very calm. if we return to Amsterdam we would love to stay there again."
54182796,"My one complaint I have for this is that it is not the full boat as the description and photos steer towards. Only a small part of the boat is the actual airbnb, whilst the rest is Peters house. It was a disappointing surprise to find this out. <br/>Despite this, I loved this little Air bnb. Host was great leaving us a little welcome basket and ensuring we were well settled in. The boat is in a great part of Amsterdam, just outside of the busy area of the city but still close enough that it's within walking distance. <br/>Would definitely love to stay again. "
54238901,"If you're searching for a perfect location to stay and awesome hosts, Grietje and her husband are the guys you have to contact. We stayd 2 nights with 12 guys to discover Amsterdam. On the second day Grietje and Henk were so awesome, that they took us on a two hour cruise through the harbour so that we were able to get some cool impressions of the city from another point of view. The Boat itself is very clean and just beautiful. You can cook, drink and just have a nice time there. City Center is not far and the bus leaves a couple of metres away from the boat. Supermarket and a nice Pub are within walking distance. We only wanted to say.... ""Thanks Grietje and Henk, it was just perfect"" Five Stars!"
54241953,"We had a lovely stay in Amsterdam, a surprise I had booked for my boyfriends birthday. <br/>Communication with our host was great throughout, from booking to arriving in Amsterdam. <br/>Our hosts were warm & welcoming & incredibly helpful, showing us around & highlighting everything we needed to know inside the apartment. They kindly accommodated our later check in time & even booked a return taxi to the airport for us when we had difficulty doing so.<br/>The apartment was clean, tidy and well equipped with everything we needed from an iron to beautiful fresh flowers & even warm blankets that came in handy for cooler evenings sitting on the balcony. The area itself was fantastic & we felt really safe in the apartment building itself.<br/>The location was absolutely perfect for us, we could see the beautiful Vondelpark from the balcony. We walked everywhere & explored the local area with the support of Jan's detailed guide & top tips, we also made use of some of the discount vouchers kindly left in the kitchen.<br/>We thoroughly enjoyed our stay & would most definitely recommend to friends.<br/>Thank you for a lovely stay, Lauren & Paul"
54251863,"Joke and Gerard are some of the most generous and warm people I've met on my travels. I was provided with detailed and an extremely accurate way to get to the houseboat but since my flight was delayed a fair bit, Gerard came to pick me up from the ferry which was very nice, and since it was quite late in the night, they even heated up some dinner for me once I got to the house. The room and the houseboat are exactly how the pictures show it, and had warm touches all over, from the oversized shower, the paintings on the walls, and their beautiful kitchen. The view however, from the room and house, is quite spectacular and the most positive experience of staying here. If you want a different yet authentic experience of Amsterdam then this is where you want to stay, it's an extremely easy commute to and from the central station, and Joke and Gerard went out of their way to suggest places of interest, and things to do in Amsterdam. We even went for an amazing boat ride on the smaller boat, a huge bonus because the best way to see Amsterdam is by water. I'd recommend Joke and Gerard's houseboat as a place to stay to everyone, and would definitely stay here again when I return to Amsterdam. I can't thank them enough for their hospitality."
54280008,This place was perfect! David made sure we got into the apartment with no problems and we immediately set out to see the sights. The room and bath were immaculate and David provided everything to make the stay comfortable. 
54375248,"Marjo was an amazing host, although we did not had a chance to personally met her, she arranged everything for us, and always kept in contact to see if we needed anything, the house is amazing, specially for family vacations, the pictures do not 100% describe how beautiful and cozy the house and the surrounding areas are. Thanks Marjo!!! The place is amazing, perfect for business travel, pictures may not reflect properly the beauty of the place, but it is beautiful"
54442313,"Nous avons passé un très beau séjour en famille sur le Boreas. Grietje et Henk sont très accueillants et disponibles.<br/>L'aménagement du bateau (cuisine, chambres, douches ...) est très fonctionnel, propre et confortable.<br/>Le bateau est à 10 minutes du centre, les stations de tram et bus sont très proches, ainsi que quelques commerces et supermarchés.<br/>Bref, allez-y sans hésiter !"
54451095,This apartment was very nicely decorated and situated in a quiet neighborhood close to food stores and restaurants. We got very good information about things in the neighborhood and also about practical things in the apartment. 
54457178,"We really enjoyed our stay in Amsterdam.<br/>The location is perfect and I really recommend to rent bikes from Jeroen to see the city better. Also there is a shopping mall right next to the place, where you can easily buy some breakfast staff.<br/>Jeroen is always there to help you and he is a super friendly host who knows the city well. Couldn't be better."
54489092,"Apartment is tiny and will NOT host 4 people. <br/><br/>Room: Tiny. Once the couch opens up, it takes the whole room. It was also pretty cold. Windows are leaky. Otherwise has necessities for a traveller like hair dryer, kettle, fridge. even coffee machine<br/>Beds: Couch bed was comfortable enough. The bed on the 2nd level is another story. It is tiny. We were three people and one of us had to sleep diagonally on the upper level with head hitting the ceiling. Very uncomfortable. It is impossible to fit 4 people in this place unless two of you are midgets or children aged 10 or less.<br/>Bathroom: Horrible. Super tiny, low ceiling, no sink. One of us couldn't even fit there standing up straight so he had to go to a nearby hotel to take a shower. There was a hole in the window (and we stayed in February) and it smelled of mold<br/>Terrace: looked nice and spacious but it was too cold to use it.<br/>Host: Ruud was nice, friendly, helpful, provided advice and even gave us museum passes. <br/>Location: 30-40 min walk to the center, 15 min walk to Van Gogh museum, 3 min to tram stop.<br/>Another thing to note: apartment is located on the upper level of a very old building. So you have to literally climb up very narrow stairs. It was also pretty cold in the apartment <br/><br/>Overall: if you are 1 or 2 average height and size people who don't really care for comfort and are looking for a place to sleep, this might work if the price is low. No romantic getaways, larger groups or anyone who likes comfort and decent bathrooms.<br/><br/>"
54606090,"Fritz met us at time arranged.<br/>Apt was in great location.<br/>3 of us  had plenty of room.<br/>Lighting was a little dull.<br/><br/>We enjoyed our stay there."
54632735,"Alles war wunderbar, die Unterkunft entsprach der Beschreibung, ist sauber und wirklich sehr zentral gelegen (Man tritt aus der Türe und ist mitten in der Altstadt von Amsterdam).<br/>Auch über Kate kann ich nichts Negatives sagen, unser Aufenthalt verlief reibungslos."
54647632,"We were welcomed very graciously, Stef and Angela were wonderful hosts, and Eddie the dog is the sweetest. The room was extremely clean, beautifully decorated, and had everything we needed. The balcony is also very nice and has a lovely view. A perfect place to start your morning with a coffee. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and have absolutely no complaints. Thank you so much for everything!"
54713263,"Wir hatten einen wirklich wunderbaren Aufenthalt bei der lieben Vibeke. Ihre Wohnung ist total niedlich und bietet genügend Platz für zwei Gäste. Sie hat uns am Tag unserer Ankunft super früh empfangen, hat sich erstmal ganz in Ruhe mit uns hingesetzt und uns viele Tipps und Anregungen gegeben. Wir haben uns die ganze Zeit über total wohl gefühlt. Mit der Tram kommt man in weniger als 10 Minuten in die Stadt. Wir werden auf jeden Fall wiederkommen!"
54728279,Rosie & Matthew were very hospitable & made us feel very welcome. The room was exactly as pictured. The location was brilliant about 200 metres or so from the local tram stop. The trains ran frequently & were brilliant to use to get into other areas of Amsterdam.
54731229,"The house and it's location are great: midway between the cultural and the crass attractions in beautiful Amsterdam.<br/>The street gets few vehicles, but lots of non-rowdy people.<br/>Very easy walking to all the city's attractions, shopping, and if you can't find something you want to eat nearby, you just ain't hungry! There was no one to greet me, and no-one answered the number I was given to call. Since I have a (hopefully temporary) mobility issue this led to much greater problems.<br/>There is a fair chance that many AirBnb guests are in an unfamiliar town, where they may not speak the language.<br/>In this price bracket I think it's fair to expect more, rather than less personal communication and service than at a comparable hotel.<br/>AirBnb should be a two way street: not just a way for people to make money from their vacant real estate.<br/>I've had different issues with several properties now, so it seems to me that AirBnb only favours the host; and of course, AirBnb!<br/>"
54751682,"Jeroen was a superb host, he was very accommodating and helpful with regards to where to go and what to do in the city. Travel into the city center was easy as can be also. The room was spacious and the bed was extremely comfortable. Overall cleanliness was good and we would definitely use Jeroen again. <br/>"
54834696,"The place was easy to find thanks to Mike's accurate explanations from the airport to his place step by step. He helped us carry our luggage (the stairs was very steep). The place was very big and the bed is very comfortable! He recommended a Japanese sushi place, it was nice but a lil' expensive though he informed us prior already.<br/>The Albert Cuyp Market was just a street behind his place and you can find lots of things and street food there is cheap and delicious! You can walk to the tourist places ie. Heineken experience, Rijksmuseum, iamsterdam, van gough. Tram is also 10mins away. A park opposite his place. Location is very good away from the busy city centre but there's no traffic jam so it's easy to reach. <br/>He booked for us a taxi on the last day since we had to leave early in the morning. Very thoughtful and gave me some meds as I was sick. Thumbs up! If I were to visit Amsterdam again, I would definitely stay here again! And recommend it to ppl"
54836024,Great place Ronald was very friendly and helpful very nice host <br/>Must recommend to stay 
55002536,ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC <br/>Totally recommend staying in windmill. Roel was welcoming and amazing at advising us about transport etc.  and made us feel like home. Breakfast all set up which we werent expecting that extra touch makes all the difference. Well done Roel keep up your good work.
55031138,"Corinna was great, gave us tips to a new city every time we saw her. Thanks for letting us in early on a long, wet and cold day."
55032108,Our stay was overall good. The room was clean & looked just like the pictures. Leo - H's boyfriend was very sweet with getting us situated & Henriette emailed us some fun things to do and places to eat more like a local. However there was some construction going on outside the apartment (that we had no warning about) that was very noisy during our stay. Our favorite part however was the consistency of a nice hot shower between all three girls. We loved Amsterdam & loved the hospitality of Henriette // if we ever came back we would definitely stay there. 
55051610,"Our visit to Amsterdam was enhanced by our stay in Manon and Claudio's home. It was modern, comfortable, clean and had everything we needed. We loved the area in Amsterdam Noord and felt safe with easy access to shopping, buses and highways when driving. The location was a bit out of the way but it suited our needs and as we had a rental car, we could drive, walk or take the bus. Thanks to our hosts once again! "
55115406,"Super appartement bien placé au pied de la ligne principale à 10 minute du centre . Balcon bien pratique pour les fumeur.Rien à changer tout à était parfait.<br/>Merci kan...:-)"
55193352,"Awesome (!!!) Apartment in center of Amsterdam. <br/>Roman was very helpful with everything. We had a very nice stay and a good time. No problems at all.<br/>Would definitely recommend for others and will book it again if I'm going to Amsterdam again in the future.  Very very nice stay again. Always a pleasure in this apartment. Lots of space, big rooms. Great location, view of the canal. Roman being very helpful. All good :-)"
55244637,"Great apartment, great host would definitely stay there again it was totally awesome "
55251910,"Un séjour inoubliable sur une péniche de charme , propre et tres bien située dans le quartier de Jordan . Expérience à vivre , une hôte adorable ! Merci pour tout !"
55298335,"really lovely place, we enjoyed the stay and the city very much! thanks for beign  such a great host"
55322678,"Floortje's apartment is very spacious, neat and cosy . It was easy to feel at home. It took us 10 minutes by bus from the centraal Station. Which isn't far at all. From her stop to the apartment it's 3 minutes walk. Although it's not far from the city it's a very quiet neighbourhood, which is fine when you want to go home and relax. Floortje made it easy with her on point guidelines. Plus she was very quick to answer any question we had. You will definitely enjoy you're stay. "
55383467,"Mike<br/>Thank you so much for the most enjoyable stay on our first trip to Amsterdam.  Choosing a place to stay really was, for me, a shot in the dark.   However, the apartment and this particular area of Amsterdam fulfilled all expectations.  The apartment  was spotless, comfortable, tastefully decorated and an absolute haven to return to after all day on our feet exploring the city.  Mike, you were most helpful and we definitely will stay again the next time we return.  Thank you very much. Laura and Alan"
55449101,"Thoroughly enjoyed our trip to the Warehouse Apartment in Amsterdam.  Taco and Jacqueline made us feel very welcome both before and when we arrived.  Unless you have a lot of luggage I'd get the bus there - the 34 & 35 go from Amsterdam Central and its only 2 stops and a short walk. The apartment is exactly as described – Taco has made a quirky and funky apartment from an old industrial unit and furnished in his own style which we thought was great.  The kids loved it (aged 7 and 9), particularly the climbing frame and rope swing and the apartment is ideal for a larger group.  It is located north of the city in an industrial area, surrounded by other industrial units and the occasional café and take away, 4 minutes from the nearest bus stop.  The area seemed ok - busy during the day with the various surrounding businesses and quiet during the evening once the businesses have closed.  The excellent bus service (number 34 & 35) runs every 5 minutes to the city centre day and night, you’re in the Central Station within 10 minutes. The apartment is spacious and bright, with the bedrooms and kitchen area located on the first floor, with the bar/social area and bathroom on the ground floor.  We found it to be warm despite the freezing temperature outside.  It retains it's industrial feel, complete with concrete floors and strip lighting.  The bathroom contains a huge shower  area that uses watering cans as shower heads - an arrangement that works surprisingly well.  The three bedrooms upstairs have internal and external windows - the internal windows have no blinds so perhaps not for the shy and retiring amongst us. So if you want something a bit different and don’t mind a short bus ride then the Warehouse Apartment could be for you."
55504961,Nikki is amazing! Her house is amazing! Everything is so near. Definitely will go back again!!
55508521,This place is really well located! We walked everywhere in Amsterdam and there is a lot happening right outside the front door. It is more of a hotel than a traditional air BnB but still good to stay in. 
55551951,"Nous avons passé 2 nuits dans cet appartement qui ne manque pas de charme, ainsi que le quartier qui se trouve à 2 stations de bus de la gare. Mais nous avons préféré à chaque fois faire le trajet à pied.<br/>Nous avons apprécié l'appartement bien équipé avec un grand lit confortable et une belle salle de bains. Nous avons été accueillis par la baby-sitter qui nous a aussi apporté le petit-déjeuner le lendemain. L'autre jour ce fut notre hôte qui a fait une rapide apparition pour déposer le panier.<br/>Comme dit dans un précédent commentaire, nos hôtes vivant juste au-dessus on entend le soir et le matin les conversations et les pas sur le parquet. Le premier soir quelqu'un est venu vers 11.30 et il y a eu des discussions assez tard. Le jour de notre départ, ce sont les enfants qui partaient tôt à une sortie.<br/>A part ces petites choses, nous sommes très satisfaits de cette première expérience Airbnb."
55579362,"Tres belle location avec des produits de base pour assurer une petite dinette improvisee. Studio agreable tres lumineux, tres bon accueil. Emplacement facilement accessible non loin du centre a savoir que le stationnement est gratuit le dimanche."
55646899,Staying at Hetty's place was great! My friend and I stayed 3 nights. Very centrally located and 2 tram stops are right out the door. Plenty of cute shops and restaurants in the area. We did not meet Hetty but her son kindly picked us up from the airport late at night and she kindly messaged us. Food is provided for breakfast which is great for running out the door to explore the city. I would definitely stay at Hetty's place again when returning to Amsterdam!
55673448," Great, cozy room right in the heart of the Red Light District. Mirjam was very helpful and communicative throughout the process, and was kind enough to let us come early to drop our bags off while the room was still being cleaned. The room and bathroom were very clean and nice, and it is a quiet place if you are traveling alone or with another person. Wouldn't recommend for people looking to party super hard and then return home loudly, as the space is shared with other units and Mirjam herself, but it is a great spot. Highly recommend!"
55687022,Great place! Thanks Nima!
55701576,"We had such a lovely time in Amsterdam, which was made even better by the lovely flat we stayed in. Room was spotless, decor was beautiful, host Mike was very helpful. The location of this flat for anyone who hasn't been to Amsterdam before is perfect! Every street you walk down there is independent shops, cafes and bars! lovely atmosphere in De Pijp! Overall I couldn't fault anything. Was a great stay! Thanks Mike"

55786259,Perfect location to spend some days in Amsterdam. Very friendly and helpful hosts. Thanks for the nice breakfast and dinner recommendation.
55793490,Amazing location! Very close to all main attractions and lots of great restaurants near by. Just a couple minutes walk from Central Station and David gave us excellent instructions on how to get to his place. The room was decorated beautifully as well as very clean and comfortable. Also very spacious. Would definitely recommend staying here for a visit to Amsterdam. 
55795292,"Laura and Arjan were outstanding hosts. They were really helpful and welcoming, making us feel at home and giving us some great recommendations. The breakfast was lovely and delivered to us at the time that we requested.<br/> The apartment is in a lovely area, at walking distance from the centre and very close to a tram stop. It is fully kitted out with everything you might need. Highly recommended!!"
55809159,"Margo and Rico are excellent hosts and provide an amazing experience with their lovely guesthouse and Houseboat.  They were kind enough to pick me up and drop me off at the train station and gave me detailed directions to town for my stay. When back in Amsterdam I would hope their space is available, I would not hesitate to be a guest of theirs again."
55847027,"I had a wonderful experience at Edwin's. His place is in a perfect location (right next to the Flower Market) and it was extremely easy to get anywhere in the city. The room itself is small with a bathroom directly next to the bedroom. If you are looking for a centrally located, clean and safe place to stay during your time in Amsterdam, I would highly recommend staying here."
55857690,Jeroen was the best host we had! He told us about all the interesting places in Amsterdam and what we must visit there! We recommend him and his place
55861717,"Amsterdam was a great experience and Raul's house is a part of it. We really enjoyed staying there. Location, cleanness, furniture everything was great. Thank you again for his hospitality."
55883570,"We were a party of 5 males aged 22-25 staying for 3 nights and the host's friend Monique greeted us on our arrival as she worked at the cafe on the corner opposite the house, she showed us around and told us the basics of what we need to do whilst we stay there, for example, feeding the cats etc. She was very friendly and helpful.<br/><br/>The kitchen was fully stocked with utensils, plates, glasses and so on which came in handy for making breakfasts and dinner on an evening. <br/><br/>The roof terrace was a great place to sit and relax to take in the surrounding views of the rooftops.<br/><br/>The location couldn't have been better with a supermarket across the road and plenty of restaurants/takeaways very close by, as well as Vondel Park just across the main street and a couple of coffee shops dotted around the area - Coffee Shop Vondel would be my recommendation.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this house to friends/family and hopefully stay here again myself - without a doubt it is the best place I have stayed in Amsterdam! <br/><br/>Thank you!"
55890575,Our stay here in Amsterdam was wonderful.   The loft was beautiful and had all the amenities needed.   The space was beautifully decorated and clean.  The bathtub was to die for!!!  The only thing I didn't realize was the stairs are not for the faint of heart..lol..definitely got a workout in climbing those each day.
55899036,"The very clean apartment was perfect for 4 guys. Wilmer was a very cool host and did everything for our perfect stay in Amsterdam. <br/>For this price there is nothing you can do wrong. There's really nothing to complain."
55899716,"David hat uns schon vor der Haustür herzlich empfangen.<br/>Das Zimmer ist ein Traum, sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet und sehr sauber. Im Zimmer stand ein voller Obstkorb und Wasser für uns bereit. Auch das Frühstück von David war klasse."
55979683,"It's a nice spacious place with a very nice bathroom, but the host made me wait in the cold about a hour to check in "
56130965,Roman greeted us and showed us around the beautiful apartment. He was waiting on us when we arrived. Extremely responsive and great to work with. 
56155294,"This is a stunning apartment in an ideal location. The ceilings are high, the living room is big, and light, the table is the ideal place to sit and work.  The couch is cozy, the bed very comfortable and the shower is great.  Just around the corner are some nice restaurants and a walk in Vondelpark is just a couple blocks away. We enjoyed it very much."
56252654,"Marga and her family were extremely welcoming and understanding.  The room was warm and cosy.  The neighborhood was quiet and safe, with only a short bike ride to get to the city.  By staying with a family, I felt I was able to learn a lot more about Dutch culture!"
56336002,"Great location near Amsterdam Central station. Place is cozy and comfortable, set in a lively location yet at a quiet corner of the street. Good options for breakfast at Omelegg and Pancakes within 2 mins walk.<br/>The room is located on the second floor so you will need to carry any luggage up the stairs though."
56384863,"We enjoyed the stay with Petra very, very much. When we arrived,  I parked the car near Petra's townhouse, but had no idea, if it was a valid spot and whether it was paid parking or not. When Petra saw the confusion on my face, she volunteered to go with me to show where and how to pay for the parking. She explained what hours to pay for. What a relief it was!  Petra offered us coffee once we were done with parking. It was such a pleasant touch. Petra has Krupps machine in the kitchen with a full basket of refills, so coffee and tea were always available in the Delft china!<br/>The room with the bathroom on-suite was spacious and wonderfully decorated in Delft style.  Gives you an immediate feel that you are in Netherlands. This decor feels fresh and modern. Everything was spotless clean! <br/>We chose to have the full breakfast in Petra's dining room upstairs. These two breakfasts were the ones to remember about our stay: wonderful food, interesting conversations, Petra's advice of what to do in Amsterdam and how to get to the places. <br/>Petra offered to babysit for our two-year old boy and we truly enjoyed our evenings in the restaurants that Petra recommended. When we came back from those outings, our boy was asleep, Petra reading her book by his side, reporting that our boy played well, had his milk, and fell asleep without a problem. We were not so lucky in many hotels we stayed around Europe.<br/>All-in-all, this was a terrific accommodation by the classy, knowledgeable and caring host. I recommend this listing to anyone, who wants their experience in Amsterdam to be one of a kind!"
56440174,"As returning guest it was again my pleasure to feel the great hospitality of Petra! Im in for the coffee next time! Awesome as usual; many thanks for letting me stay at your place again. See you again next time:) It was a very nice stay at a clean, lovley place! I would recommend it to everybody and iam going to book it again for sure. Thanks Petra for having me. Cheers Jörg"

56505032,"A true home away from home.  Great location,  excellent  host and beautiful  apartment/ home.  Was really one of my favorite  things in Amsterdam  to have a little place to call your own and to get away from all the other tourist and busy side of any city. Gerald an excellent  host and very warm and inviting  person.  He went out of his way to make sure I really have a great time in Amsterdam  and is very very knowledgeable  about what to see where to go and where to eat. Thank you for a great time and will definitly stay here again om my next visit. "

56705227,"Breakfast was tasty, room was clean, close to the city!!! Everything was just fine :)))<br/>"
56713317,"Adorei a estadia. :) Com muita pena minha, não pude conhecer pessoalmente a Hanneke, contudo houve sempre comunicação entre nós. Hanneke é muito simpática e acessível. A chave de casa foi deixada num local combinado pelas duas.<br/>A casa tinha acabado de ser limpa quando entrei. As fotos mostram exactamente como a casa é. Uma casa amorosa, limpa e bem cuidada.  Ideal para um casal e talvez com uma criança pequena. Fica num bairro muito sossegado e a 5minutos a pé do centro.<br/>Recomendo vivamente a casa da Hanneke :)"
56750940,"David is the perfect host and his place is just amazing. Exactly like in the pictures, nice, bright and very clean. Everything was in perfect order and the locations doesn't get any better.<br/>It only took us a 5 minutes walk from the Central Station and David waited for us at the place even though we arrived 3 hours before check-in. He even left us some sweets as a welcome. On the day we left, David let us leave our bags at the place after check-out until our late flight back.<br/>We had absolutely nothing to complain about while staying there. The bed was to die for and all the furniture and interior is very stylish.<br/>No question that David's place is our home in Amsterdam - we wouldn't stay anywhere else and we will be back, for sure.<br/>Both David and his place deserves 10 stars!"
56753559,"My friend and I had a wonderful stay with Andrea!! She was very welcoming and gave some great tips on what to do and where to go in Amsterdam! <br/><br/>The location of her apartment was great. It's right by a Metro station so it's easy to get around.<br/><br/>The room itself was very clean and so was the bathroom. I could not have been happier and would highly recommend staying here."
56781899,"Ingo & Marlies were wonderful hosts - full of helpful information. The apartment is beautiful - modern furnishings and appliances, corner apartment with lots of natural light and beautiful views and in the perfect location on the Singel. In addition, it is filled with all the apartment amenities you would ever need during your stay (their listing description and photos matched).  We've been to Amsterdam several times and this neighborhood is by far our favorite - canal district, right next to the ""9 streets""  with great shops, restaurants, and bars. We had an amazing stay and will definitely book with Ingo & Marlies on our future trips to the Netherlands.  Thank you Ingo & Marlies!"
56856320,We had a very enjoyable stay at Hein's flat. The location was convenient for getting around the city with the trams and metro near by. It's a good place to stay if you don't want the noisy atmosphere of the centre. The flat was just as described as well as very functional for the space it has. Would definitely come back!
56862378,"Naomi and her husband were avery nice and friendly hosts, the apartment was in a very good location, it was clean and beautifully decorated. The apartment was just as described. We had a little problem checking in but this had nothing to do with Naomi. The only thing is: there is no possibility to hang up your clothes. Thank you, Naomi, we had a nice and pleasant stay!<br/>"
56903306,"Andrea is a friendly and organised lady. Her lovely place is hygienic and cozy. She also places lots of travel info in the guest room. We had some interesting chats at night and were inspiring. Her neighbor is extremely helpful too! The only problem we found is that the bed is too comfortable for us to wake up early in the morning:P<br/>Tiffany and Stephanie :)"
57183223,"This apartment is in a wonderful location, close to the centre but quiet and very beautiful. It is well equipped, full of character and with fantastic hosts who helped make our stay a special one."
57205980,"Nabila has received us in her apartment in the most kind and warm way possibile.<br/>The apartment was clean and comfortable with a beatuiful garden. The area is quiet, silent and full of nature, far from the crowd of the center. You can also visit the near village of Sloten by feet.<br/>Even if the first week we had to take a tram and a bus to move from the house to the center, because of roadwork on the line, the travel was comfortable and took about 25 minutes to arrive to Central Station and Nabila gave us all the informations to get there in the fastest way.  From last monday tram 1 returned on its way and now goes straight to the center. <br/>We appreciated  very much to be out of the center. <br/>Nabila has answered to all our requests about the house and the neighborood (where to buy tickets, to move without the tram 1, to find a supermarket, to eat something in the quartier without going to the center of Amsterdam) in the warmest and quick way possible, kindly and sharing with us her time, showing the area around. <br/>The apartment has a separated entrance and privacy is complete.<br/>Nabila is really a kind and gentle person and is a pleasure to speak to her.<br/>We recommend her apartment to whom is interested."
57238308,"Nice accomodation, Floris was a very good host, we had everything that we may need. Amsterdam is an awesome city, I would totally recommend staying here."
57268005,"The apartment was very cute and atmospheric, the location was great and everything worked just like agreed."
57276174,"Our trip to Amsterdam was wonderful not only because it is a fun city, but because of the stellar accommodations provided by our hosts Laura and Arjan! The apartment was clean, cozy and just what we needed for our stay. They went above and beyond our expectations. Our only regret was that we did not stay longer! Out of all our Airbnb stays, this is our favorite. We cannot praise them enough!"
57303967,"Its really a lovely house. Just enjoy it. It's a little far from the central, but really worth it's!"
57337344,"Corina was very warm and informative about her city, where to walk and where to eat. Also quick to respond to messages on Airbnb. Location in Jordaan very central and walkable to museums and attractions. The airport bus stops right at the end of her street. The room itself is cozy with a really nice power shower. And the Thai restaurant next door is outstanding. "
57378545,"Meine erste Airbnb-Erfahrung begann mit einer sehr detaillierten Wegbeschreibung von Yvonne. Das Haus liegt in einem sehr schönen Quartier, gleich beim Bahnhof Amsterdam Zuid. Das Zimmer war sehr schön, sauber und war mit einem äusserst bequemen Bett ausgestattet. Auch das Bad liess keine Wünsche offen - sehr sauber und gross, nur durch die Gäste genutzt. Yvonne hat den Superhost-Titel zurecht erhalten. Mit Ihrer Liebe fürs Detail (Kaffeemaschine mit Kapseln im Zimmer, selbst Wattestäbchen waren im Bad verfügbar) macht Sie den Aufenthalt sehr angenehm. Sie hatte auch immer Zeit für einen Schwatz - sie und ihr Mann waren äusserst angenehme Gesprächspartner.<br/>Ich kann Yvonne's Airbnb-Location nur empfehlen - auch wenn dies bedeutet, dass dann für mich weniger Termine frei sein werden. <br/>"
57381458,"The host is so great and welcoming! He welcomed us by some drinks and traditional waffles, which made us feel warm. The rooms are exactly like shown on pictures and are quite nice. We were lucky enough to stay while he hosted his birthday party and had a lovely afternoon and evening with him and all his friends. The surrounding neighbourhood is overall good and convenient. Markets, supermarkets and restaurants could be found nearby. Transportation is well-accessible as well."
57412404,"An amazing experience! <br/>Place is not far from central of Amsterdam and its in nice quite area. Getting back from busy streets was amazing. Even night transport is very straight forward. (One bus journey) <br/>Also Micha was a great host and made me and my friends feel very comfortable and welcome. <br/>Defined coming back next year! "
57417135,Great apartment in the BEST neighborhood in Amsterdam. Highly recommend this experience. 
57428998,"As our first experience we were lucky to find Sjoukje.<br/><br/>We weren't expecting someone as kind and funny and above all involved even in case of emergencies (sorrryyy for waking you up !!) Sjoukje took time to guide us through Amsterdam by showing us the stuff to do, she even invited us to a concert. She is an excellent host we would really love to come back or invite her to Paris.<br/><br/>The apartment is comfortable, more is the bed. The description is honest, we didn't walk very long to get to the center. The neighborhood is actually really nice, and it's extremely quiet! We don't see it much on the pictures. At last if you go you'll meet Naz the cutest cat would loves eating plastic bags.<br/><br/>Léa & Clément"
57578697,"The flat was perfect, it was great to be able to stay just 15 minutes walk out of the main hustle and bustle of Amsterdam and walk along the quiet streets and canals. Our arrival was perfect, we were able to leave our bags while we went exploring, having arrived early, and returned to find that our heavy bags had been taken down into the flat. The breakfast was fantastic and Laura and her family were very gracious and welcoming!"
57598418,I had absolutely wonderful days at Marga's house! <br/>Guest house was warm and cozy<br/>We played a lot of music together and I loved it :) little far from the city center but it's just cuz of I can't ride on bike xD<br/>I won't forget the time in there and I would like to go her house again if I have another travel to Amsterdam!<br/>Thanks to Marga and her family(especially Okki) for having great days in Amsterdam!
57615356,"Appartement idéalement situé dans un quartier calme, à 10 min en tram du centre ville. Hetty a eu la patience d'attendre notre arrivée, plus tardive que prévue, pour nous accueillir chaleureusement!<br/><br/>L'appartement n'est que destiné à la location et est constitué de plusieurs chambres. Plutôt propre, mais vétuste. Cela nous a étonné mais c'était cependant suffisant à nos quelques jours, car nous étions toute la journée à l'extérieur! Il est appréciable de disposer d'une cuisine et d'un séjour lumineux (lorsqu'il n'est pas occupé). Nous avons seulement été un peu déçu d'apprendre, le jour de notre arrivée, que nous allions partager l'appartement avec une famille de 4 personnes lors de la dernière journée et nuit de notre séjour."
57621518,"My sister and I came for 5 nights in Marloes and Gabriel's apartment, ans we had a wonderful stay. They are very kind, welcoming and helpful, as much as Christian, their friend who took over when they were away on holidays. The apartment looks exactly like the pictures, the beds are comfy and the kitchen all-equipped. Marloes and Gabriel allowed us to use their bikes, which was great since the apartment is at least 20 minutes away from the center of Amsterdam by bike and public transportation there is not cheap. We had a whole lot of fun. Thanks again !!"
57626158,Very nice Journey in Manon ' s house 
57657858,The apartment is in a brilliant location. The house is attractive and full of character with a great outlook. It is quiet but only a 20 minute walk from Central Station. Laura was very helpful and the apartment was as described. The breakfast was excellent. We would certainly book here again if coming back to Amsterdam
57680899,"La ubicación no era la mejor, tampoco estaba muy limpio el alojamiento, el desayuno que ofrece es cafe o te y siempre que uno vuelve  se encuentra con la puerta abierta de la habitación por qué perro la sabe abrir y entra. Pd: tengan cuidado con el clavo suelto que tiene una de las bases de la cama, me rompió una campera. Con respecto a la anfitriona no tuve mucha conversación, salvo con uno de sus amigos que estuvo muy atento. "
57692401,"Zazilie's dad was there to greet us and he was very friendly and welcoming. He showed us right up to our room, and he and his wife were available to answer any and all questions that we had.  The room itself was great, perched high about the city streets, with bright, vibrant colors, and a large terrace featuring a great view of the canal and the surrounding homes.  My wife and I often would get take out and enjoy the rooftop terrace in the evenings.  What a wonderful place to stay!"
57709997,"Très bon accueil de Joke avec un goûter et de nombreux conseils pour passer un agréable week-end à Amsterdam. Appartement propre agréable calme. Petit déjeuner bon, varié et fait maison. Accès facile au centre d'Amsterdam à 20 minutes en tramway (au pied de l'immeuble). Tout était réuni pour passer un agréable séjour. Nous vous conseillons vivement cette chambre."
57790694,"Perfect location to rest but also close to Amsterdam center. Light, clean and roomy guest-room with entertaining information for tourists. Jeroen is vert careful and a guide to explore different parts of Amsterdam."
57813125,The place has a nice view however is very small and requires 4 flights of very narrow stairs to reach it. It was very hot when we stayed and no air conditioning made it almost unbearable. Never the less we had a great time in Amsterdam and the host was very efficient and accommodating.
57858851,"This is my first airbnb experience which is just wonderful! The place is the same with the description - cozy, well equipped and convenient. Although Toetsie was not at home during my stay, she kept emailing me to make sure everything is fine and tell me about the special events in town. She is so caring and I am very lucky to have met her (though not in person) and her friend, Francois! "
57862485,"Prior to travelling Laura was very helpful with any questions we had regarding our stay, what to bring, buses to catch etc and offered a shuttle service from the central station.<br/>On our arrival in the very picturesque surroundings we were met by Arjan, owner  and husband of Laura who was very friendly helpful and approachable. He immediately made us feel welcome whilst completing some short and simple admin in his own lovely home. It was our first time in Amsterdam and he was very helpful when we bombarded him with the usual tourist like questions, how to get around, best places to see, best things to do. He then showed us to the accommodation which is the basement of their house and it was absolutely perfect. Good size throughout, nice big wet room, traditional decor , clean and a complimentary bottle of wine to boot! Having been provided with a key we were able to come and go as we please.<br/>Lovely continental breakfast delivered to  the door in the morning to set you up for the day. Arjan also offered us a complimentary boat trip around the canals of Amsterdam which again in keeping with every thing else was just perfect, which we had arranged on our second day. <br/>We had a wonderful time in Amsterdam and our only regret is that we couldn't stay longer. We will definitely return to stay with Arjan and Laura  and  will also recommend it to the rest of our friends and family. We couldn't have asked for a better experience. Their friendliness and hospitality were second to none and come highly recommended."
57921810,"We only met our host briefly, but she was incredibly sweet. Beforehand, she gave us directions to the flat that were clear and simple to follow. She had to leave before showing us around, but she left a paper outlining everything we needed to know, as well as recommending restaurants, clubs, and other attractions. The flat is lived in, so there is food in the fridge and personal items around the flat, such as pictures and cards. We were welcome to the food, as long as we replaced it, which was a very sweet gesture."
57985959,"Very good experience!<br/>The house and Annette's help were just fantastic, making highly enjoyable our stay in Amsterdam!. For sure, we would repeat. Thank you."
58014724,"I can not say enough complimentary things about this wonderful apartment and the fantastic hosts! Situated in a quiet residential street, the apartment is exactly how it appears in the pictures - spacious, comfortable and clean. The beds were extraordinarily comfy, the working kitchen was fantastic, even the bathrooms were great! With the added bonus of the two balconies - perfect for relaxing and enjoying the surroundings.<br/>Our hosts were more than accommodating and fantastically helpful with local knowledge and transport links. Nothing was too much trouble for them and they even left a bottle of wine for my girlfriend on her birthday! Lovely people!<br/>The area too is great, with supermarket, bars and restaurants all within in a stones throw. Not to mention easy tram links across the city.  <br/>Thank you so much Esther and Marco for an amazing stay - we will back! "
58147822,"It was such a pleasure staying with Ruben. The room was as described, and in a great location! I know I will be going back to Amsterdam soon and will definitely be going back to stay with Ruben! Thanks again, and if you're ever in Liverpool, you are very welcome to stay with me! "
58163628,"Mike is super nice and helpful.  Great neighborhood, easy access to transportation.  Not touristy.  Several grocery stores around to restock on water, etc.  Great food right there.  What else do you need out of a place? "

58425854,"bonjour,<br/>La chambre correspondait tout à fait à la description qui en avait été faite, Gina nous a accueilli avec gentillesse, donnant à mon fils dont c'était l'anniversaire un petit cadeau, par la suite elle fût très discrète afin de ne pas nous déranger, les petits déjeuners étaient copieux, bref un agréable séjour.

58436858,房东非常热情好客，能够细心的给我们推荐旅游景点。这个房子的地理位置相当不错，到中央火车站只需做34号线，十几分钟即可直达，房价也非常便宜。总之，这是这个房子是出来旅游的理想选择。
58473001,"Jeroen was a really nice and kind host; he gave us great explanations about what to do and where to go in Amsterdam. The room was also great, and the bed is amazing! <br/>We had to share the bathroom with an other couple, and we weren't aware about it.. <br/>But we spend a really nice week-end! <br/>Thanks a lot to him"

58596846,Idealy located between the city center and the museum district. This houseboat and host are awesome.
58610639,"I was very well welcomed to Margas Guesthouse. The guesthouse was lovely, very much to my taste. I had a small cottage by the river, behind me a park that was booming with birdsong in the morning. There was a small fireplace, air was good and the bed was sumptuous. Everything was easy with Marga, I always got in touch with her in no time, and she took good care of everything. "
58625018,"When We arrived first, We had a pretty good impression. however the morning when We took the shower There were no hot water.<br/>Wifi was just working in the leaving Room and not in the room at the First floor.<br/>Towel were very dry- better To bring yours<br/>In addition To That the check out was planed for 12pm and the cleaning ladies and the owner came at11.30 without ringing. IT make us very incomfortable.<br/>Once We leaved they called us on a very agressive way (insulting, trash Word and streaming) in order to talk about a glasses broke by their cleaning lady.<br/>Unfortunately, It could be a great Experience in a very good place but cheap owner. It was nonetheless a good week-end."
58863482,"Het appartement van Debby was perfect. Het lag op een prima afstand van het centrum op een heerlijk stil plekje. We werden prima welkom geheten, met informatie over plekjes om te eten, inkopen te doen enz. Kopieën van plattegronden had ze beschikbaar. <br/>Het appartement is echt super verzorgd, koffie en thee is beschikbaar, evt. badjas en (nieuwe) badslippers. Het geheel heeft een luxe uitstraling. Ontbijten op de kamer is prima mogelijk. Kortom: heerlijk plekje."
58894078,"Io e un'amica siamo state per tre giorni nell'appartamento di Hetty. La stanza era uguale alle foto, molto pulita e con un bel terrazzino. l'appartamento si trova in una posizione davvero ottimale, la fermata dei tram si trova davvero vicino, nella strada dell'appartamento. Si può quindi raggiungere il centro o la stazione facilmente e velocemente. Hetty è una persona davvero amichevole e disponibile, molto premurosa. ci ha dato indicazioni davvero preziose. Ci siamo trovate molto bene. Raccomando questo appartamento e la sua proprietaria."
58924581,"Clear instructions on how to find the house made it easy. Francois made us welcome on your behalf. Our room and the living area was clean and comfortable, though not enough space for 2 suitcases in the bedroom. Carrying the suitcases cases up the narrow stairs was a challenge, but we did it! A lovely friendly cat."
58998360,"Pim was a very welcoming host and left a lovely hand written note welcoming us to Amsterdam and his home. The location was fantastic, easy access to downtown but a peaceful neighborhood near a lovely park. 2 out 2, would recommend!"
59074476,"She is nice. She help me washed my clothes and hang them well.<br/>The checkin time is not flexible, she was not at home while I arrive at Amsterdam so I have to eat at the restaurant to wait her.<br/>If you sensitive to the smell of cigarettes, she smoke at home. My clothes are still smell like cigarettes after I left her home.<br/>I slept at the bigger bed first night, but second day while I came back, she already took away all sheets on the bigger bed. So I have to sleep on a tiny bed.<br/>There is no lock in the room.<br/>She will not help you storage your luggage after your checkout which is not convenience. I spent an hour on finding an locker in the central station which cost me 20 euro because there are too many people need lockers.<br/>The wifi signal is bad <br/>她人很好帮我洗了衣服收了10欧还帮我挂好了<br/>即使你到阿姆斯特丹了 checkin的时间还是要按她的行程来定 我就在外面硬吃了一顿韩餐打发时间<br/>房间有烟味 如果你是味道很敏感 还是要慎重 我离开以后衣服都是烟味<br/>订了一个房间但是第二天她把我睡的大床被套全部拿走只能睡小床<br/>房间没有锁<br/>不让寄存行李要自己多花20欧在中央车站自己寄存，超级拥挤而且没有locker我花了一个小时找locker<br/>房间Wi-Fi不好用"
59213894,"Raul and his aunt, were wonderful hosts. The house is absolutely amazing, great location and includes all the amenities you would need. I stayed there a week and didn't feel like I missed out on anything! The bicycles are a much much wanted plus. Thank you Raul. "
59219600,"It was nice to stay in Jorrit's studio in Amsterdam. The studio is located in a lovely area with many things to discover and explore. There are also supermarkets around, restaurants and it's near the city center with good public transport connections to move around.<br/>Even though my husband and I checked in late at night, we were warmly welcome and the host shared with us great info to enjoy Amsterdam even more. "
59263751,"This was first AirBnB experience and first time in Amsterdam; Chris made me feel right at home from the beginning!<br/><br/>Chris is a great host and very interesting person to have a conversation with. He is very welcoming and friendly, helped a lot with various questions. I will definitely come back and stay with Chris next time I look for AirBnb in Amsterdam!<br/><br/>Place is as described, quiet, comfortable and very close to public transport. Its away from the usual tourist crowd and is well equipped for all day-to-day needs. I highly recommend the place.<br/><br/>Thank you Chris for being such a great host! "
59362713,"Olaf clearly knows how to host you! Nice guy, very social and always willing to help you. He suggested us where to go out for the night, a few places where to eat, where to rent bikes and what to visit. The house is clean, and it looks exactly like the pictures show... great terrace also!<br/>You will kind of feel like being in Disneyland (accessories,  blankets, frames, furnitures, pillows, pictures ..) but if you like (/do not mind) being surrounded by Mickie Mouse, Minny, Donald Duck (...) you will have a great time there! :-D"
59436908,"Hi Marga, thanx for the hospitality and the help you have provided to me, I had a great time in Amsterdam. I really like the houseboat, is really unique. Take care."
59458156,Great apartment right next to the Amstel. Thoroughly enjoyed our time here and Joelle was a great host. Helpfully organised someone to meet us with the keys after we arrived late from London and provided some great tips for seeing the city. Beautiful flat. Highly recommend.
59484752,"Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt bei Mieke. Das Zimmer war freundlich, hell und ruhig.<br/>Die Unterkunft ist leicht mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln zu erreichen, daher ein guter Standort für einige Tage in Amsterdam.<br/>Mieke hat uns auch Tipps für Programmgestaltung gegeben.<br/>Empfehlenswert!!!"
59556004,"Sally's place is juste incredible, well situated, just nearby the city center. We spent a nice moment there. Loved the fresh flowers ;)"
59613532,"Really enjoyed our stay.  Beautiful apartment, with unbelievable views, and very comfortable new bed.  Mieke was very helpful and welcoming.  Only slight downside was that the apartment is a little way out, but very accessible by the trams and nice to see different parts of Amsterdam.  Would definitely recommend."
59654712,Great stay!
59671345,"Thank you to Laura and Arjan for being such friendly and welcoming hosts. Their offer to pick us up and drop us off at the airport for a nominal fee was very convenient. Our host was helpful and available to answer questions anytime. We enjoyed a number of excellent restaurant suggestions.  We were welcomed with a complimentary bottle of wine which we enjoyed on our first night. Bottled water was a nice touch.  Our stay included an amazing breakfast each morning.<br/><br/>The location was perfect, we enjoyed walking to everything around the city.<br/><br/>Our host took us on his boat and gave us a personal tour of the canal, while sharing a chilled bottle of wine – wow, totally unexpected.<br/><br/>The place we stayed in was on the bottom level of our host’s home and it was really lovely, clean, and comfortable. It included all amenities, we slept well, and the place was exactly as described.<br/><br/>Our host really went the extra mile to ensure we had a great experience in Amsterdam. This was a perfect first Airbnb stay for us. We would highly recommend staying here and hope to visit again!<br/>"
59713332,"Sherlys aparment was very nice!<br/>It is in the near from all, but we were every time with our car. So we saw very much of amsterdam !<br/>Sheryl was not in the near, but we had every time contact and she helped us!<br/>Thanks for all!"
59772459,"Our experience with Laura and Arjan was amazing! It was our first trip to Amsterdam, and they were so helpful. Arjan arranged a pickup and drop off to the airport and it was perfect. He gave us great information along the car trip. The location was great and the apartment itself was very clean and inviting. Our breakfast in the morning was delicious and a great start to the day! Arjan and Laura made our first trip to Amsterdam something we will never forget with their charming hospitality. "
59787267,"Elianne, her daughter, and cat were incredibly welcoming to me and my two friends (it really felt like you were coming home after each day). Elianne was very helpful in terms of recommendations for things to do and places to see. Her home is in a perfect location as we were about a 10-15 minute walk to the main city center and major attractions like the Anne Frank House. Her home is unique, artistic and beautiful and the perfect size for our 4-day stay. We had a lot of privacy due to the location of the bedrooms. Staying here really helped make our experience in Amsterdam so great. We would all definitely stay with Elianne again in the future!"
59793006,"Absolutely amazing would be the only proper review. Sally was the kindest and most hospitable host we had in our two week journey around Europe. The apartment was even more beautiful than the pictures or the description that was written. Sally was willing to help us find bike rental facilities, good restaurants as well as the ins and outs of Amsterdam. We will make sure to only stay here for our future visits.!!"
59840167,Really really friendly host! Great place to sleep or hang out. And close to Amsterdam Centraal.
59917823,"Joke, foi muito bom hospedar na sua casa! Você é uma pessoa muito atenciosa e com o coração muito bom! Nunca vamos esquecer da sua hospitalidade e o tratamento recebido.<br/>Grande abraço,<br/>Murilo e Geórgia."
59994942,"Everything was great. The neighborhood has the best atmosphere and everything is within walking distance. Edwin was helpful and amazing. Will deffinately be coming back. If you are lucky, his adorable cat will stop by and say hello."
60120652,"Kiek and her husband are very nice and hospitable hosts. They were flexible with our arrival and departure times and a pleasure to talk to. They provided coffee, milk, and snacks for our stay and were very gracious. <br/>The place is very clean and nice with adequate heating. The only thing is the short ceiling, I'm 6ft and had to hunch in many places - but it was totally worth it. Excellent stay and looking for an excuse to come back."
60180866,"We had a really nice stay at Jeroen's. His sister welcomed us in a cosy and tidy flat, with all needed stuff available. We would recommend it with no hesitation! Cheers"
60241544,"Gerard was wonderful and let us check in and out with flexible times! After two bad AirBnB stays, this was pretty awesome in comparison. Great location and super cute room! Perfect for a romantic getaway. PLEASE NOTE: wifi was bad...hard to even send an iMessage or check the weather. "
60378276,"Hein has been a great host and his apartment was great to stay at. The apartment is small but has everything you need and it is located in a very central area. The apartment was clean and had everything we needed. We sadly never got a chance to meet Hein since he was out travelling, but his friend Josie took great care of us! We warmly recommend people to stay at Hein's place while visiting Amsterdam. /Johan and Maria"
60382739,"In verband met werk in Amsterdam zocht ik een slaapplek in de buurt voor één nacht. Die heb ik gevonden bij Marga en Rico en dat beviel prima. Het contact verliep soepel en de accommodatie was top.<br/><br/>Mijn nogal onchristelijke in- en uitchecktijden (aankomst 23.15 uur en vertrek om 06.30 uur) waren geen enkel probleem. Op weg naar werk kon ik 's middags alvast even langsrijden om de sleutel op te pikken en Rico gaf toen meteen een duidelijke rondleiding. Heel flexibel dus.<br/><br/>Het huisje was netjes, schoon en goed uitgerust. Het voelt wel een beetje vreemd dat je voor de badkamer en het toilet in de privé-woonboot van de familie binnen moet gaan, maar dat zit meer tussen de oren dan dat het echt vervelend is.<br/><br/>Al met al een erg positieve ervaring, en als je een leuke plek zoekt in Amsterdam is dit zeker een aanrader."
60416069,"Amsterdam was AWESOME! Diewert was extremely helpful, and was even tentative when I became ill during my stay. Location was perfect, and close to anything you would need. Diewert even helped hold our bags until our flight. A+++++ "
60443397,"We felt welcomed at Matthijs & Francina's place. The room was clean and the bathroom was spacious. The location was great, about a ten-minute walk from the Amsterdam Central Station. Matthijs was very helpful in giving us just the right tour info and advice. The best part came the next morning when we were greeted by fresh, savory breakfast in a nearby bakery. Absolutely tasty and impressive! "
60479689,"Den Wochenendtrip in Amsterdam bei Klaartje unter zu kommen war einfach eine super Idee! Die Kommunikation mit Klaartje war sehr gut sowohl vor der Anreise als auch generell. Unterkunft genau wie auf den Fotos gezeigt, wenn nicht sogar schöner. Tolle Anbindung durch die fußläufige Tramstation in die Stadt & was den Trip vor allem so besonders gemacht hat sind Klaartjes zahlreichen und tollen Tipps, sowohl was essen gehen betrifft, als auch die Abendplanung. <br/>Nur zu empfehlen und gerne wieder! :) "
60521319,"Couldn't describe how much I enjoyed staying with Anneke for the weekend. She was such a wonderful host and and had the perfect property for my first AirBnB experience. Super accommodating host, great chef, amazing artist are all just a few of the hats she wears. You won't be let down staying at Anneke's BnB!"
60651868,"We had a fantastic holiday in Amsterdam staying at Carolien's apartment, just as described and the perfect location. <br/>The apartment is located two minutes walk from the nearest metro station, which is four stops to the city centre of Amsterdam - super convenient, safe, cheap and about a 5 min journey. <br/>We were welcomed by Patrick, given the keys to the apartment and shown around the home - he was also full of useful tips and information. <br/>We would definitely love to stay at Carolien's home in the future. It was a pleasure to come back to the apartment after a busy day exploring :) "
60732099,"We had a lovely stay at Jeroen's place - the room was really clean and spacious and the bed was so comfy! We pretty much had the bathroom downstairs to ourselves. He told us about loads of places to go in Amsterdam that we wouldn't have known about without his advice, and all in all he was a really accommodating and friendly host! Would definitely recommend!"
60790230,"Très bonne expérience.  Riza est très aimable et super généreux. Il m'a montré personnellement les avantages au tour de la l'appartement. Les transports publics, les marchés, restos, etc.  Appartement très propre et bien aménagée.<br/>En plus, il nous a laissé à disposition toute des bonnes choses pour avoir quê des merveilleux petits déjeuners."
60828610,Viola and Daniel have a really nice place that I highly recommend.  It's a short walk or tram ride out of the main centre of Amsterdam which means you have peace and quiet when you want it but everything Amsterdam has to offer is only minutes away.<br/>The apartment is nicely appointed and would suit both a short or longer stay.  Make sure you ask for suggestions for cafe's and restaurants as there are some really good local places to choose from.<br/>I had a fantastic 6 days in Amsterdam and Viola and Daniel were perfect hosts.
60936635,A lovely place. Olaf is an excellent host. The apartment is located in a beautiful area and the tram 4 lets you close. I would definitely return.
61002512,"Our stay at Valentines was lovely. The house was very warm and inviting and spacious. We did not meet Valentine but she was very helpful with her recommendations of where to go and what to eat. <br/>The only downside would be if you want to cook. We ate dinner out so it wasn't a problem. However there is limited utensils in the kitchen such as no chopping board, no knives or wine glasses. <br/>Everything else was perfect we would definitely recommend this place. The area was great too, we oiled walk to the town centre and there are lots of bars and restaurants. "
61049960,"We loved to stay there.It was a very very warm welcome and we felt like home.<br/>Every wish we had gets true.<br/>It was very nice to tlak to you also in the night.<br/>We were a big party family.<br/>We loved this!"
61097055,"Wilmer is a very kind person and we felt really like home in Amsterdam. Clean place and very comfortable place with Wifi, Sonos music, two big tv...<br/>The apartament is close to the n°14 Tramway that allow a comfortbale visit of Amsterdam and a fast track to the center,<br/>close to the apartament there is a supermarket and places where to have breakfast or lunch or delivery dinner.<br/>On a next visit we'll go for sure again at Wilmer's place!"
61150507,"Micha was such a nice and welcoming host. He showed us the entire apartment with detail, explained how to get to the supermarket and how to use the public transportation. The place was clean, spacious, comfortable and had food available. When I return to Amsterdam I will definitely stay again in Calypso. "
61155131,David contacted us before our arrival to make sure we could get in and provide us the keys. He had several brochures regarding the city and did an awesome job answering all of our questions.
61311580,"Beautiful room in a beautiful neighborhood! Frits provided us with everything we might have needed and gave us traveling tips for the rest of our trip through Europe. Awesome location! The backyard terrace was amazing and a great place to get fresh air and relax. Tons of great places to eat and drink around the place. If you’re allergic to cats, you might want to bring your allergy meds because the cat from upstairs may wander into your space."
61331670,"Heleen met us and kindly waited as were delayed arriving. She had great advice to share on cafes,local food, transport and markets and made us feel very relaxed using her apartment for a few days.Also gave us pamphlets on sight seeing and a great map of Amsterdam. She was prompt and helpful when we needed help getting her tv to work, although in the end we were rarely going to watch tv as so much to see in Amsterdam. It was peak tourist season but the apartment is out of the madness of central down town . It was so so peaceful at night despite all the apartments in the area.The  two balconies meant it was also bright in the living areas, with the back overlooking trees of the central courtyard enhancing the feeling of space. We hardly cooked during our stay as de pijp had lovely food stores , great Cafes only 5 minutes away, and even organic supermarket with pre prepared delicious meals. We used trains and trams each day and both easy to access and walking was great in that area too as the canal is less than one minute away. Initially the 2 flights of stairs looked challenging but we soon got used to it and worth the climb to get into the cosy serenity of Heleen's apartment at end of long days sight seeing. "
61346951,"The flat is located near the tram station and 20 min walk distance to the central station. Marian and Simon are so kind and merciful home owners. Both rooms were clear, tidy and warm during 2 days, and their decoration feel us like we were at home.<br/>I would probably prefer this flat again for the next Amsterdam trip.<br/>Serhat "
61359186,"Klaartje è  stata davvero gentile. La stanza molto bella e confortevole e calda, per una freddolosa come me. Quartiere tranquillo, il tram per andare in centro è  il numero 4 e impiega 12/15minuti per arrivare a piazza Dam. Si prende proprio vicino la casa. Ben collegato. Super consigliato. Grande Klaartje!"
61444563,"A Joke foi uma excelente anfitriã, simpática, sempre disponível para ajudar e orientar.<br/>A localização é óptima, cerca de uns 15 minutos da Central Station de transportes públicos. A paragem destes fica em frente à casa.<br/>As fotos correspondem à realidade e a casa possui todas as condições necessárias para uma boa estadia, nomeadamente na limpeza e no conforto.  <br/>A Joke serviu uns pequenos almoços muito bons e ainda teve o cuidado de os diversificar durante a estadia.<br/>100% recomendável!!! <br/>"
61486015,"L'appartement est conforme au descriptif, très bien décoré, fonctionnel et très propre. <br/>Il est idéalement situé à une quinzaine de minutes de l'hyper centre et au calme.<br/>Mike a été un hôte disponible et souriant. Nous recommandons chaleureusement cette location pour découvrir Amsterdam. "
61496877,"Patricia's home is absolutely perfect for a stay in Amsterdam.  It is comfortable, private, beautifully decorated and well-located.  Patricia and her husband were extremely welcoming and I would not hesitate to contact them again if I am ever back in Amsterdam.  I highly recommend Patricia as a host!  "
61668423,"David, our Amsterdam host, was accessible by email to answer questions and share ideas before we got to Amsterdam, which made the planning of our days there much easier.  He greeted us at the door when we arrived and hefted our luggage up the stairs.<br/><br/>David's room is perfect--just right!!!! It is immaculately clean, the bed is large, there is adequate hanging and drawer space and the huge window fills the room with sunlight.  Did I say the bed is large??? What a luxury that seems to be in Europe.<br/><br/>The neighborhood is charming, and ideally located for tourists.  It is a very short walk (quarter of a mile at most) to Central Station, on a canal with boats and ducks and lovers strolling by, and it comes with an abundance of nice restaurants and sidewalk cafes to choose from.<br/><br/>There is one flight of stairs up to the room, and I do not think this is a negative for most travelers.  The stairs are straight up (not curved with ""triangle"" stair treads), and there is a firmly set banister on both sides of the stairs if you feel safer going up and down holding on to something.  At the top of the stairs is a library of Amsterdam places to go and things to do.<br/><br/>David has really thought of everything.  Without being intrusive, he has still found a way to make things better for his guests all the time.  I highly recommend this accommodation for single travelers or for couples.  You will not be disappointed.  Jane"
61717377,"It was our first time to Amsterdam, and as luck would have it, our stay was the same week as the Brussels attacks, so finding a cozy place to call home for a few days was that much more important.  Petra was the consummate host, and we found ourselves in an ideal BnB experience (like, without the air part).  <br/><br/>She was super-easy to coordinate with, greeted us with cake and coffee, and showed us to our spacious room, kitchen and bath (all remodeled on her 1st floor), and between the down bedding, the plush towels, the scrumptious breakfasts and our own full kitchen, strong coffee and a full range of teas, we couldn't ask for more.  She even assisted us in printing online tickets.<br/><br/>Thank you Petra for your hospitality and graciousness!"
61799929,"loved our break in Amsterdam. Corina is a great host we were made very welcome. There was a lot of laughter. The room was just as advertised, spotlessly clean and tidy. Couldn't have found a better located place. Bus link from and to the airport almost on the doorstep! "
61803567,"This room is absolutely amazing.  It's super warm and the wood burning fire gives it the most relaxing atmosphere. A huge thank you to Marga and Rico for being very helpful while I was in Amsterdam.  They were very easy to communicate with  and provided absolutely everything that I could have needed.  The room is idyllic, and I highly recommend Marga and Rico's guesthouse.  I'll be sure to try and stay here again the next time I'm in Amsterdam!"
61816866,房间很干净，还有架钢琴、Marga 人很好，推荐大家去住哦~
61843623,"Wir haben 3 Nächte in Amsterdam verbracht. Lage ist 1A, David ist ein super Gastgeber. War alles unkompliziert und wir haben immer schnell Antwort auf unsere Fragen und Anliegen erhalten. Daher würden wir die Location jederzeit weiterempfehlen.  Tamara's home is a beautiful place to stay. The house is located in a quiet area a little bit outside Amsterdam but by tram it is easy and fast to go downtown. Tamara was in touch with us answering all our questions. <br/>We can recommend this place very much - a very nice place and a good host!"
61845410,"From the start till the end of our stay, we had a pleasant experience with Matthijs, he greeted us warmly on arrival, chatted with us about what we could do around Amsterdam and even had a little booklet prepared. On the day we left, he was repainting the rooms. This shows the effort he puts in to his space. <br/>The room had a kettle, cutleries and wine glasses. The bathroom was very clean and had plenty of hand towels, bathrobes and towels provided and it smells really good which adds to the experience. Matthijs lives upstairs and privacy was not an issue. I would definitely stay in this Airbnb again if I return to Amsterdam, highly recommended! (: <br/> Location was great, if you're taking the tram from Amsterdam central you will find this really handy! Wifi connection was fantastic. Everything was explained really well and quick by Alex when we arrived. Only downside is that the bathroom can get really cold at night and in the morning. Overall, it's a great place to stay. "
62006046,"We had such a lovely time, Marga Was brilliant at keeping in touch and she and her family were welcoming and relaxing people to stay with. There were always helpful suggestions about where to go locally and this was invaluable to make our trip so enjoyable. We do not cycle (lol) and we were pleased and grateful for lifts in to the nearest transport into Amsterdam! What a lovely place to come 'home' to after long wonderful days in the city! Thanks so much for your gift of supper on the first night, after we were held up with technical issues in the airport and had not made plans for food! We would not hesitate to recommend booking with Marga. "
62028085,Awesome location and a very cozy stay. Only was there for a short while but would recommend this location to all 
62146157,"The outstanding feature of this apartment is its location. It is on the beautiful Singel Canal, right in the heart of Amsterdam. But while being within easy walking distance of Dam Square, Central Station and many other points of interest, it is also tranquil and located in a nice residential neighbourhood. Yet, walk out of the door and there are cafes and restaurants very nearby, and lots of lovely places to stroll.<br/><br/>Pre-arrival communication with Erik and Ernestine was excellent.  We were met at the flat by their cleaning lady, who handed over the keys and showed us around (though her English was limited, and our Dutch is zero). The apartment is clean and nicely decorated. The bed is comfortable with a good firm mattress. The kitchen area is tiny and kitchen equipment is limited (as is made clear in the description) so don't expect to be able to cook substantial meals. It would benefit from the addition of a toaster.  The bathroom is small but clean and nice, and the shower has excellent pressure. Our hosts had provided plenty of towels, as well as some shower gel etc.<br/><br/>Overall our stay was very pleasant. Erik and Ernestine were responsive and helpful. We asked for slightly lower pillows and these were immediately provided.<br/><br/>The TV was not working. Erik quickly sorted out access to Netflix so we could watch movies, however there was no access to normal TV channels. Erik offered to have someone come and fix this, but we declined as we did not want the bother. Likewise the cold/hot/boiling tap in the kitchen was behaving strangely - it was very difficult to get cold water from it!  Again Erik was very willing to sort this out but as we were only staying three days, we preferred just to manage rather than have interruptions.<br/><br/>These were relatively minor issues, and in no way spoiled our enjoyment. The apartment was exactly what we needed - a good location and a clean and comfortable bed.  We would normally give it five stars, but because of the small problems we encountered we feel we can only give four stars on this occasion."
62165278,"Ifigenia was wonderful and made us feel perfectly at home. Everything was ready as promised when we arrived, and she explained all we needed to know clearly and with her heartwarming smile. The room was exactly as described in the pictures and profile. We were there in cold weather, but the room was welcoming, cozy and perfectly warm. It was a pleasure to get home after a day in the city! <br/>The location is lovely, in the historic center Jordaan, from where one can walk practically everywhere in the city. Public transporation is close by, whatever direction one chooses to take. From the airport there is a direct bus line that stops very near the house. Little (and large) cafes dot the neighborhood, as well as restaurants, cheese shops, curios shops, and any other shop one can think of. <br/>I would definitely recommend this place and we will go back there when we return to Amsterdam! Thank you "
62174971,"We could not have asked for a better place to stay. This was our first trip to Amsterdam and we choose David's place based on pictures and descriptions. The apartment is just as it is shown and described. David left the keys in a lockbox so we could get in a bit early. He later stopped in to make sure all was good. <br/>Location is a huge asset for this apartment. 5 minute walk from Central Station and right on a canal. Plenty of restaurants very close to apartment.  Although the area is quite busy, noise was not an issue. Windows are very insulated and we never heard any outside noise at night. <br/>House was very clean and a perfect size for the two of us.  David was very helpful and provided some great knowledge. "
62246704,Thanks a lot for being our host. We have had a wonderful time at your appartement. Everything has been like your discription. You have been very friendly and we always got answers of all our questions. Perfect stay with perfect hosts. 
62274620,"I was in Amsterdam for a conference for a couple of days. Chris welcomed me warmly and helped me with all information I needed for the city. I didn't spend a lot of time in the house, as the days were busy, but from the time being there, I can tell I had everything I would need, and the place was always nice, clean and tidy! I was also able to conveniently go to the city center, either by tram (a few stops) or train (1 stop). Chris is a very friendly guy and has been very nice to chat with. I would definitely stay again if I happened to pass by the city sometime!"
62285393,"Hatte ne tolle Zeit in Amsterdam. Die Wohnung liegt sehr ruhig und trotzdem gelangt man recht schnell ins Zentrum, wenn man möchte. Das Zimmer, die Dusche und das WC sind sauber. Die Gastgeberin war sehr freundlich und hat mich am ersten Abend sogar zum Abendessen eingeladen und mir hilfreiche Tipps gegeben. Als Willkommensgruss lag ne Schokolade auf dem Tisch. Die war so lecker, dass ich mir von der gleichen Sorte einen Vorrat für zuhause gekauft habe. Man bekommt von der Gastgeberin auf Wunsch auch eine Tramticket, dass man aufladen kann. Dadurch spart man sich 7,50 Euro. "
62498296,"Great place, wonderful host! Can absolutely recommend this place.<br/>Thank you, cathelijne!! Best regards, anne "
62561336,Micha was a great host! He immediately made my friends and I feel welcome in his apartment and even bought us some food to get us started! He told us how to get into town and where everything was which was great help. He was also always available when something did not work or we had any questions. The apartment was great and cozy and the neighborhood was nice and quiet which was perfect for relaxing throughout the day! Everything with Micha and his apartment was perfect in Amsterdam and I highly recommend staying with him.
62567248,Micha was a fantastic host and we felt very welcomed to his home! The flat was excellent and very accessible to public transport and the nearby shopping district. The flat was well furnished and very clean and i would definitely recommend it to friends.

62679269,"Nima was a very nice, accommodating, and communicative host. His place is in a very quiet local neighborhood. The commute to downtown takes about 15-20 minutes by bus but the bus station is located fairly close to the building."
62698567,"Fantastic Location and Experience. Feeling at home in the middle of the nature but just 20min cycling to the city center. Marga and Rico also offer us to pick up from the airport, rent their bikes and a propper breakfast so just perfect. We will definitely come back."
62737566,"This place is great, end of discussion. It´s perfect if you are a couple or single and want more peace and space than many of the crammed studio apartments in Amsterdam can offer. <br/><br/>Sjoerd and Kelly gave us good info on how to get there, which was fairly easy from the airport, and we picked the key up from a nice elderly man next door. <br/><br/>Once inside we were welcomed with a bottle of wine and a paper with ample info about the flat and tips for local restaurants. Nice! <br/><br/>The flat is located in Amsterdam West, which is a little off the beaten track, but we rented bikes for €10/day at a local bike shop, and had a blast cycling around on the amazing network of bike paths (which is basically everywhere). It took about 10mins to the city center by bike, or there are trams very near by that took 10-15 mins. The neighbourhood is international, and has restaurants, supermarket etc. There is also a canal, and a nice park (Erasmuspark) very close by. Being a little out of town is an advantage as this neighbourhood is very quiet, which is nice after a long day in the busy narrow streets of central Amsterdam.  <br/><br/>The flat is located in a quiet street, and has a beautiful garden facing a quiet backyard. We had breakfast outside every day :) In the front part of the flat is the living room which is nice and spacious, with a large sofa, tv and stereo. Moving toward the back is the kitchen with 6 gas hobs, and lots of space for cooking. The bathroom is next to the kitchen with entrance both from the living room and the bedroom, with a nice shower and even a bathtub hidden under a floating closet! Toward the backyard is the bedroom with a comfy large double bed. The only drawback for us was that the bed only had a double duvet (we prefer singles). I´m sure it´s no problem to arrange this differently if you ask. <br/><br/>Behind the kitchen there is also a little open area where you can do yoga, dance or whatever you fancy. <br/><br/>A nice thing is that the bedroom is separate from the living room. This way you don´t have to go to bed at the same time. Apart from the toilet which had a regular door, the apartment has sliding doors between the different rooms, so if someone is sleeping they might be disturbed if you´re doing noisy things in the rest of the apartment. Keep this in mind. <br/><br/>The interior of the flat is very cozy and ""earthy"", with wooden panels and nice decorations. The flat was very clean, tidy and tasteful. We felt very comfy there. <br/><br/>Kelly and Sjoerd were very nice and accessible and replied quickly when we had questions. <br/><br/>Overall conclusion: You can´t go wrong here. Thank you so much for our stay, we hope to be back!<br/><br/><br/><br/>"
62745162,"The hosts were extremely helpful throughout the booking to my arrival at their great flat and accommodated my request for a late check in time.  On arrival, the host walked me through the really clean/tidy flat and pointed out all the essential amenities that came with the flat. The flat is located in a really great  neighborhood  and if you are into the outdoors, Vondelpark is right down the street with easy access to all the main museums as well as many great restaurants. Overall, I had a fantastic time and I would book this flat again in the future and/or recommend to my friends."
62780711,We had a wonderful stay at Marian and Simon's basement for 2 nights whilst we were in town to watch the Amsterdam marathon. The two rooms (for 3 of us) were clean and the beds were extremely comfy! The neighbourhood is absolutely beautiful and Vondelpark is just at the end of the street. The house is also on one of the main tram lines meaning you can be in central Amsterdam in 10/15 minutes. Marian and Simon were extremely welcoming and always available to answer any questions/queries we may have and recommended a great little place for dinner. I would definitely stay here again!
62788636,"Karlijn is a wonderful host. She made both my friend and I feel very welcome. It was lovely to come back to a quieter area, and beautiful apartment, where you could just relax after a busy day sight-seeing.<br/><br/>The apartment is very close to the beautiful Vondelpark. The Van Gogh Museum and Rijksmuseum are only a short distance from the other end of the park. I highly recommend this walk!<br/><br/>We used trams to get around the city.<br/><br/>I wish we had stayed longer!"
62807162,"We didn't meet Pim but everything was like he told us. The apartment is great, with a good location in the centrum of Amsterdam ! I recommend it ! "
62854176,"Petra is very nice and her home is very comfortable. I came to Amsterdam for a training show. It's easy to take public transportation from her home to RAI center. Around 20 minutes. BTW, Petra cooked very well. The breakfast she made is very delicious!! "
62969194,"This apartment is extremely nice! When we arrived it was clean and exactly as advertised. It has everything you could ask for plus a few luxuries including heated flooring. <br/><br/>It is located near enough to the town centre that you can easily and quickly get there by tram, but not so close that the area is over-crowded.<br/><br/>Marcel is an excellent host and goes above and beyond to make you feel welcome and make sure you have everything you need. He even picked us up from the airport as he was passing by!<br/><br/>This was my first time using Airbnb and I was not disappointed. I would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone staying in Amsterdam!"
63006166,"Everything was exactly as described. It was a spacious basement apartment, with two beds, a large bathroom . There was even a small fridge and the hosts provided cereal, milk, fruit and cooking utensils. They were very flexible on the arrival time and were there to great us on arrival. It was in a fantastic location on the beautiful Herengract Canal, close to everything; a beautiful neighbourhood. I would definitely choose this again."
63086037,"Josie is great host. place is clean, cosy and comfortable. location is easy to reach from airport. nice quiet neighbourhood. supermarket is within walking distance. convenient to central and museums - all reachable via tram no 5. definitely recommended :)"
63169402,"The apartment was well described by the listing. Really good experience, the host was very kind and forthcoming to us. We highly recommend it for anyone who wants to live like a Dutch and explore the beautiful Amsterdam. the room n 2 we rented for the week end was perfect. cozy, clean, nicely decorated with the traditional white and blue simbols like the dutch ceramics. very close to the center, abt 10 min by tram n 1. only 5' walking to a brunch restaurant, staring at jacob, very nice place. pub just few meters away. petra did her best to be both discreet and still very available to us."
63244476,"Had a great first airbnb experience! Nice apartment in a nice neighbourhood, easy to find. Toetsie made everything easy, and would definetly stay with her again! "
63258550,"Jeroen was a welcoming host and did not hesitate to spend time telling us where some not so well known places were. The room was really nice and the location is easily accessible and right next to a small shopping centre with a wide variety of shops inside, would definitely recommend jeroen's room and would stay there again :)"
63302922,"Toetsie es una anfitriona muy amable. Nos recomendó buenos lugares para visitar, la ubicación es cerca de transporte público y de  Oosterpark, y a una distancia que se puede caminar hasta el centro de la ciudad en poco tiempo. La habitación es pequeña pero cómoda y la cocina está bien equipada. Muy recomendable para una estadía en Amsterdam :)"
63377815,房主人非常好，早早在房门口等着我们。因为我们飞机晚点了还等了很久。直到我们抬着行李上到门口，我们真的被二楼的厨房感动了，还有饭厅的各种小乐器和吊床。这里有火车可以到花园和机场，还有公交车到市中心的景点。
63382758,"Marcel and the other hosts are really great and helpfull, our stay was perfect, the city is incredible and the bedroom was very good. When you go there take as many breakfasts as you can, it's very tasty. And eat something in the terrace, the view is perfect. Thanks very much for the reception, and sorry for the not perfect english."
63399457,"David's place is in a great location, walking distance to everything and really close to great food options, particularly in china town. Though in the red light district, the room is very quiet and the street is very charming.  "
63403513,"Corina's place is such a sweet spot! Comfortable, beautiful, and wonderfully located! We walked everywhere from Corina's and immediately felt like a part of the neighborhood. Corina is a wonderful host with a kind heart, helpful spirit, and great laugh! Thanks, Corina for the best stay ever!!"
63456462,"Rini's house was so beautiful and it is such a pleasure to stay in. The garden was so beautiful and even in winter it looks lively with the plants and flowers. You could see the stars and the clouds at night from the end of your bed, and also read in the daylight just by the window. The apartment is also super clean and fully equipped, the location is ideal as well - located by the river and convenient to go to almost everywhere.<br/>We also thank Rini, Martin and Rini's friend who gave us a lot of help and big welcomes! We had such a great stay in Amsterdam:)<br/>"
63511719,"Our stay was very nice. Great location, clean house and Toetsie was in touch whenever I had a question. "
63595179,"Nicely decorated studio and easy access with tram 17 from central station.<br/>Friendly welcome by host in the absence of Iambnb, company who manages the rent. <br/>I missed a place to hang my coat and other clothes. The Wifi is quite weak.<br/>I found it quite noisy at night due to the cafe just opposite open till 3am."
63645582,"A friend and I traveled to Amsterdam for two nights and stayed at Petra's Bed & Breakfast. We arrived in the afternoon and were promptly greeted by Petra who showed us around. She also took time to ask us what our plans were and told us the best ways to get places. Additionally, we had some passport issues while we were there and Petra and her family were more than helpful, going out of their way to make sure that everything was handled before we went out to explore the city. Her sons offered us suggestions of restaurants and places to visit, which was very helpful because we were unfamiliar with the city. The room we stayed in was gorgeous and had an attached bathroom. The Bed & Breakfast was located off of a main street in a neighborhood of Vondelpark and was only a 5 minute walk from two different tram stops that took you to the center of the city. This was perfect because it was easy to get anywhere and was still a quiet place to stay at night. Overall, we had a great trip and Petra really made the stay even better. "
63774567,Jeroen was a great host who gave us lots of tips about north Amsterdam. Room was as described. The huge comfy bed was a particular highlight! Around 15 minutes from central station so was very convenient for us. 
63829534,J'ai passé 2 nuits dans l'appartement. Accueil très agréable même si je suis au milieu de la nuit. L'appartement était très propre et très calme. Je le recommande.
63942254,"Without any hesitation I can recommend staying at the studio apartment. Everything was just as described and clean, Nabila was very helpful and took great care, too. The center of Amsterdam was very quick and easy to reach from there. Would come back any time!"
63974636,The directions to locate this AirBB were easy to follow. The location was central to everything but just off of the crowded areas. There are plenty of restaurants and transportation is simple and nearby. 
63997791,"We had an amazing time at the B&B Vondelpark House. Petra was the greatest host, everything was super clean and prepared with love to detail. There is literally nothing you can do wrong with this choice. Its a perfect location, and you can tell that Petra is passionate about having and operating this B&B. We would book it anytime again and recommend it to our best friends& family. Thank you Petra!"
64041679,"Nancy's house is located in a calm and nice neighborhood, close to a bus stop that takes you to the central station and it takes 20 min. The room was very small and with almost no place to hang the clothes, yet the bed was very comfortable. Nancy was a nice host, who gave us good advice on places to visit in Amsterdam and around. She also offered us her bike for our stay, however we didn't use it because we were 2 people. <br/>What we didn't like about this place was the presence of 3 cats, of whom we were not informed before. Cats hair was everywhere on the floors and I didn't feel comfortable having 3 cats around."
64044545,"Close to city but felt like in country just off river surrounded by trees.  Host Marga was friendly and generous and seemed eager to help in finding my way around city and places to visit, was happy to collect and drop me off at train station.  I enjoyed my few days and will stay again if passing through."
64172786,"We had a great time in Amsterdam thanks to Wendy and her friend Petra. I don't know what to say, everything was perfect: host was so kind, big and clean house and good location. They gave us many tips in Amsterdam and if you have any question, they would answer you quickly :)"
64174814,Thank you very much for the nice days in your guest house. I feel very good and it was a nice experience. Shurely i like to stay her again.
64200973,Nice trip :)
64227663,"Micha is very very friendly! We found a delicious salad when we arrived home even if it was late). The apartment was big and had everything nearby transport, supermarket etc)."
64304347,"Rosie was a delight, as was her charming apartment! She was on hand to talk me through keys, room + breakfast details, as well as offer tips on local activities that won't be in your Lonely Planet book. The apartment is located next to two tram stops that get you into Amsterdam Central in 20 mins. Ideal location. Overall fantastic stay and would definitely return there when I re-visit Amsterdam (so much to do!)."
64443917,"Estuvimos 5 días hermosos en Amsterdam en casa de Nathalie, todo muy lindo, era la primera vez que usaba este estilo de alquiler, me parece muy atractivo. El departamento muy típico y cómodo, salvo las escaleras que con las maletas fue muy incomodo poder subir, en el barrio mas lindo y cerca de todo para ir camiando y disfrutando de cada paso que dabamos. Gracias."
64536349,"Meine Freunde und ich verbrachten 3 Tage im Haus von Inger um meinen Geburtstag in Amsterdam zu feiern. Der Aufenthalt bei Inger war wirklich super. Ihr Haus ist wunderschön und sehr wahrheitsgetreu zu den Fotos. Die Einführung des Hauses war sehr herzlich und bei Fragen wurde sehr umfangreich geantwortet. Wir hatten glücklicherweise sehr gutes Wetter, daher saßen wir auch gerne abends im Garten und haben die Sonne genossen. Das Haus selbst hätten wir am liebsten gar nicht verlassen, da es einem wirklich super zum Entspannen war. Zudem hatte Inger ein Buch bereit gestellt mit weiteren Informationen zur Stadt und Freizeitgestaltung, daher hatte man auch ohne vorherige Vorbereitungen einen kleinen Überblick. Zudem war auch die Küche und die Fahrräder durch kleine Notizen beschriftet, wodurch man ohne weitere Fragen super zurecht kam im Haus.  Bei meinem nächsten Aufenthalt in Amsterdam würde ich definitiv gerne wieder kommen !"
64560445,"We loved our stay at Rosie's house! Amazing location in a safe, quiet area nearby great restaurants and public transit. Her home is charming and clean. Wouldn't want to stay anywhere else!"
64564220,"Great location - really easy to get to from Central station, 10 minute walk or 2 stops on the bus. Lovely hosts, very friendly. We had breakfast each morning - simple wholesome fresh and great coffee and orange juice. Also the complimentary bottle of wine was very welcome when we got back from running the Amsterdam marathon. Lovely neighbourhood as well. Really enjoyed our stay "
64661259,My daughter and I had a great time. Corina was an amazing host. She was very kind and helpful and the room was excellent. That made our stay in Amsterdam even better than anything we ever imagined!
64673105,"We rented a room for two in the heart of Amsterdam. The location is really great for first timers. Edwin was always available, very attentive and keeps the pace very tidied up. Loved his energy. He easily became a friend. I couldn't have asked for a better host in my two weeks of traveling in Europe. I would definitely recommend people to stay with him if you are traveling alone or a small group."
64691503,Olaf was very accommodating took care of all our troubles such as calling a cab.  Unfortunate that we didnt get to say bye to Olaf but thanks and wish him all the best
64715635,A beautiful clean spacious room. Very convenient having kitchen access. Petra was friendly and welcoming. We will definitely visit again. Thank you for having us Petra.
64739819,"Vondelpark House offers you a very warm welcome, very smart and beautifully  designed accomdodation. You could compare it to boutique style accommodation. We stayed in the room without the bathroom but as there is only one other room it feels like your own private space. The shower is wonderful. Everything is spotlessly clean and maintained and the bed is so comfortable. <br/>Very easy to find and easy journey from the airport. The area is a little gem of tiny and very good restaurants so you don't really need to go far. But there is a tram close by to get you more central or you can take stroll through Vondelpark to get to other nice eateries and a little organic market we found on the Saturday. <br/>We couldn't recommend Vondelpark House enough (and will to our family) and hope to visit Petra, a most hospitable host, when we visit again."
64770429,"Super accueil !!<br/>Merci Matthijs pour tes conseils qui nous ont permis de découvrir Amsterdam de manière très agréable ! et encore bravo pour ton français, ce qui nous a permis de discuter plus simplement !<br/>Logement très agréable et très bien situé en pleins centre d'Amsterdam, ce qui permet d'avoir rapidement accès aux différents quartiers.<br/>Et le petit déjeuner est vraiment délicieux....<br/>bref je vous recommande vivement ce logement pour une immersion au coeur d'Amsterdam !"
64848164,"Corina fue muy  agradable , nos hizo sentir como en casa. La habitación era grande y con baño privado , muy lindo y limpio todo. "
64899652,"Rosie was not there when we arrived, however her daughter and son made us feel very welcome. <br/>The bedroom was sparkling clean with lovely sheets and a view from the small terrace.  The bathroom was likewise clean and well appointed.  The location was superb.  Enough out of town to be quiet and peaceful but just around the corner from the tram line.  We truly enjoyed our stay and would return. "
64964870,"Loes was a wonderful host! We were warmly greeted and felt like we could ask if we needed anything. The apartment is very cute and quaint, just what we wanted. It's in a small quiet neighborhood away from tourists but not a long walk to a lot of the sites. It takes 20 min to walk to the train station.<br/>The company that they have taking care of their books, iamb&b, however we were not impressed with. We were told via message we could be there at 2pm. When we got there, we were told that it hadn't been cleaned yet. We had to sit there and wait for him to be done, he left at 3:15. Then, he didn't have a sheet for the bed (we thought he had left one but it was a round tablecloth) and that someone would have to come back. We were then woken up that evening with the delivery of the sheet. Also, old towels from the previous guest were left in the bathroom that were still wet, so that was pretty gross.<br/>Overall, great hosts and a wonderful apartment. Besides the ordeal with the company when we had arrived, we had a pleasant stay. "
64985992,"Little to add to what others have said. The place is in a really great location, comfy bed, lovely host. "
65145110,"The pictures make the apartment look much bigger. The bathroom was very small - basically you had to shower over the toilet. Moreover, the window inside the bathroom was broken and the loft was very small and the wifi connection was poor. However, the host was really nice as well as the neighbors and the terrace was really nice! "
65159149,"Edwin is a perfect host! He prepared all information about the apartment for us and we use all these notes, it was really useful from place for breakfast to taxi to airport)) and also we found perfect waffles on the table"
65173438,"our family had a great stay in Amsterdm and part of this was due to how pleased we were with the flat, plenty of space for four, tastefully furnished and enjoyable views over the canal. everything that one would hope for."
65216916,"Colm and his wife are very lovely. Their house are perfect and the room is cozy and super comfortable. It is only 15 minutes bus from the center and you may find a bus stop for just 5 minutes walk. They offered me and my friend different style of breakfasts everyday, super enriching and nice for the start of a day. They are also accommodating... Colm even offered us a bottle of wine during the visit. I will definitely come back again if I go to Amsterdam again! Recommended for sure and without doubt!"
65219181,"We have had a very nice stay in this house. We enjoyed the lovely studio, had much benefit from the good traffic connection and appreciated very much the kind and gentle welcome of Monique. "
65220158,"Wird haben insgesamt drei Tage in Amsterdam und in der Wohnung von Marloes und Gabriel verbracht. Die Wohnung ist wirklich sehr schön, modern und zentral gelegen.  Die Bilder in der Beschreibung stimmen zu 100% überein. Besonders Klasse ist,  dass die Holland-Räder kostenlos zur Verfügung gestellt werden.  Alles in allem war der Urlaub sehr schön und die Unterkunft hervorragend.  Wir kommen sicherlich wieder.<br/>We visited Amsterdam for three days.<br/>The flat was great, modern, comfortable and exactly like the Description. We enjoyed it.<br/>We will come back."
65322630,"Micha was a very pleasant host and the location was as you can see on the photos. Good place to stay and near the metro to visit Amsterdam.<br/>Very quiet also and Micha takes time to explain all the things you can need."
65352430,"it was a very good experience to stay here. marga and Rico are very helpful. Their hospitalities makes me feel like home. I was sicked during the day in Amsterdam,marga have made some hot lemmon water for me. that was very warm.<br/>the facilities are also very good. Quite peaceful place to stay. surely I will be back next time to visit amsterdam"
65402526,"Loved the fact that the guesthouse was close to the Rai train station. (15 min walk) and from there I was able to get to any direction I wanted. <br/>The hosts where very friendly.<br/>As a personal suggestion about Amsterdam if you want to travel by public transport buy the travel card 1,2 or 3 day. Or if you feel like biking, you can rent a bike from Marga for 7€/day.<br/>Have an lovely time visiting Amsterdam."
65452097,"Marga and her partner were very warm and welcoming. The guesthouse is a charming little addition, similar to a cottage. They provided maps and advice for local restaurants, as well as offered breakfast and bike rentals since EVERYONE bikes in Amsterdam. They even gave me a ride to the Rai Station so I could catch my flight home!"
65520783,"Es war ein schöner Aufenthalt in Amsterdam bei Hans. Das Appartment was sehr schön und großzügig. Alle Angaben waren zutreffend und in Ordnung. Das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis war nicht ganz passend. Für das Geld hätte ich mir ein wenig mehr erwartet, aber insgesamt eine gute Wahl für einen Kurztrip. "
65635660,"Very welcoming hosts, brilliant location, very accessible and well equipped apartment, photos very accurate representation, would highly recommend to a friend - had a great stay! :) "
65653012,"A Caroline foi muito acolhedora desde o início, tendo sido muito flexível a nível de horários, quer de check in quer check out!<br/>Apesar de não ter usufruído muito da casa a mesma tem todas as comodidades necessárias para se poder fazer refeições e passar um serão em casa.<br/>A nível de localização é óptima! Um bairro muito acolhedor, com muito comércio e locais para comer, muito próximo do supermercado e dum mercado biológico muito giro (apenas aos sábados)! Está também a 5min da Casa de Anne Frank e outros pontos históricos."
65688670,"Great place to stay!... Micha was excellent and had the room ready for us. He was great!.. very nice, clean and easy access to the center. Thank you so much for everything!"
65771184,"What a wonderful stay we had at Rinis studio flat for our 3 night break in Amsterdam! We were given very accurate descriptions of the accomodation and his directions were very straightforward. The flat was stylish, clean and had everything that you would want. Rini even left us milk, fresh croissants, ham, cheese, smoked salmon and other snacks..much appreciated after travelling. The fresh flowers were beautiful. The best thing is that the flat is based right in the heart of Amsterdam beside the Amstel river/Blauwbrug, to the rear of Rinis art studio. It also has a small patio garden area. Everything is literally right  on the doorstep. Rini even provides bikes free of charge. He is a wonderful, helpful host. Would thoroughly recommend. We ll be back! "
65779170,"Tomo excelente, muy comodo apartamento, amplio, moderno. perfecto para 4 personas.<br/>cocina equipada.<br/>anfitriona muy atenta, y flexible con el check-in. <br/>La zona tambien es muy buena, comercios y restos cerca. desde alli hasta el centro de amsterdam hemos ido todos los dias caminando (25 minutos).<br/><br/>"
65925524,"My stay at Edwin's was amazing. The room was very comfortable and spacious. The bathroom is right next to the bedroom and is shared with the 3 other guests. I had no issues sharing it and the bathroom is always clean. The set up of the bedrooms is in a way that allows privacy and it is also fun interacting with other guests, I made new friends. The area is also very very fun! There are clubs, bars and restaurants as soon as you walk out of the door. It can get loud on the weekends but me, personally, I like it and enjoy it. You will feel the itch to be out having fun. If you need some peace to sleep just take some earplugs. EVERYTHING was walking distance or easier access by public transport. The tram station is just a few blocks away. It was a great experience and you feel part of the neighborhood and Dutch lifestyle. I'm looking forward to go back and I'll definitely book Edwin's place if available. My only suggestion to the traveler is don't make my mistake and take a large suitcase. Edwin was super nice and helped me with my luggage. I forgot many European homes have small/tight stairs. Take two small ones if you need to :). And also I felt very very safe walking around everywhere and at home. As a female solo traveler my entire family was concerned but the area is very nice and safe :).  Don’t think twice and book. This is my second time at Edwin’s and his place is just as I remembered, amazing. The location is great you can walk everywhere or choose to take the tram, there are two stops really close by. My room was perfectly clean and the bathroom is always clean as well.  Best location to stay in Amsterdam. It can be loud at night, I personally love it but if you are a light sleeper take earplugs. There are literally tons of restaurants and bars down below you can get food or a drink at almost any time! I will book it again when I return to Amsterdam. Best choice!"
65930852,"Maxime was a great host !<br/><br/>She received us at our arrival, and she gave us very good advices for our stay.<br/><br/>Her flat is also very nice and quiet, thank you again !"
65938165,We had a great time staying Hein's place. It As super convenient with a metro station and a supermarket minutes away. The space is great for two people or one. We were provided with guides and the young lady who received us was more than willing to help with advice.
66083537,Very comfortable room with ensuite shower and air conditioning. Fantastic location. Highly recommended. 
66247927,"Rosie and her family were warm, welcoming and very helpful, recommending places to go and see and restaurants to eat in during the day, for which they had an extensive collection of brochures and leaflets and additionally were very willing to undertake additional research online for their visitors.  The room I stayed in was well-appointed and comfortable and the facilities were very good. <br/><br/>Her apartment is very conveniently situated in a quiet neighbourhood with a supermarket and restaurants close by and a tram stop three minutes’ walk away.  It is a 20-minute journey away from Schiphol airport, a 15-minute walk from the museum quarter and a 25-minute tram from Central Station, Amsterdam’s main transport hub.  <br/><br/>I can thoroughly recommend a stay with her.<br/><br/>"
66308586,"Great apartment , great location ! Roman is a very nice guy , the apartment was clean and accessorize ! Thanks a lot !!!"
66477450,"Appartment was comfortable the host was accommodating and v helpful. He helped us to take Upma& down the luggage up to his 3rd floor Appartment. <br/><br/>There was privacy and kids loved it as the Appartment is full of cartoon characters and comics !!<br/><br/>I recommend it  "
66583231,"We loved our stay with Boogaard's! We have the wonderful Jack Russell room and it's perfect! We only stayed here for 2 nights on our way back home to Malaysia but when we checked into B&B, it was exactly how we expected the place to be and much better! <br/><br/>Dennis was a wonderful host. The moment we get to the B&B, we were briefed on all what we can do and where we should go etc. The B&B is located on a quiet street and for a place in the heart of the city, this is certainly a warm welcome to us. <br/><br/>Will definitely recommend my friends to stay here if they ever visit Amsterdam!"
66590568,"Moi et mes trois amis avons passé à très bon séjour à Amsterdam. La maison comporte des avantages comme le fait qu'il y ai un jardin (parfait pour les petits-déjeuners et soirées d'été). Aussi, la localisation est idéale (station de tramway et supermarchés à à peine 5 minutes à pied). Cependant, nous étions très déçus par les chambres. En effet, elles ne correspondent pas au descriptif de la maison (une grande chambre pour 4 dans le sous-sol....).<br/><br/>De plus l'étage est inutilisable car il est utilisé pour stocker des costumes de théâtre. Le plus gênant à surtout été le fait que la troupe passent plusieurs fois (souvent sans même prévenir ou alors très approximativement) alors que cela était indiqué nul part!<br/>Nous pensions avoir le logement entier pour nous et c'était loin d'être le cas.<br/>Je ne recommanderais pas cet airbnb car la description est mensongère. Aussi, je dirais que la capacité est plutôt de 2 personnes au lieu de 4. Un séjour plus long qu'une semaine aurait été gênant."
66645309,Toetsie is a great host! Love her cat Roky. Staying here near Oosterpark affords one a lite different perspective on the city. Quite nice! Bed was comfy. Kitchenette was nice to start the day off with. Close to many things; including major Trams to get you anywhere. All in all a solid experience.
66693395,"We loved the easily accessible location, nearness to transport links, the cleanliness of the accommodation, ensuite shower /toilet and the historical beauty of the house, the host has thought of everything and very hospitable.<br/>Climbing steep stairs to the room may not be for everyone but they are part of the 17th century structure that one is lucky to hire out."
66727192,"Miejsce w 100% zgodne z opisem, bardzo fajnie urządzone i zadbane. Bardzo ciekawie zaaranżowana i przemyślania przestrzeń sprawia, że przebywanie w domu Barbary i Arjana sprawia wiele przyjemności i komfortu. Za domem znajduje się niewielki ogródek wyposażony w ławki i stolik, idealne miejsce na spędzanie długich letnich wieczorów.<br/><br/>Barbara i Arjan bardzo nam pomogli w zorganizowaniu naszego pobytu w Amsterdamie. Przekazali nam szczegółowe informacje odnośnie dotarcia do ich domu z lotniska czy też listę miejsc wartych odwiedzenia w okolicy, oczywiście wraz ze wskazówkami jak do nich dotrzeć. Naprawdę były to bardzo celne wskazówki, które zaoszczędziły nam wiele czasu. Ponadto udostępnili nam swoje rowery, a na powitanie czekał na nas miły upominek w postaci wina i rewelacyjnego holenderskiego sera :))<br/><br/>Absolutnie 10/10, polecamy !!!"
66757957,"Toetsie, is really warm and welcoming person. You certainly wont get such an authentic and sincere contact in hotel.<br/><br/>Casa is cozy and bed is really comfortable. Neighborhood is quiet - I slept window wide open all the time. <br/><br/>Thank you, Toetsie!"
66774368,"Very welcoming on arrival and on hand if anything was needed.<br/>Nice little place not too far from the centre"
66820174,We had a wonderful stay at Carolijn's apartment.  The location was fantastic.  It was a close walk to many of Amsterdam's top sites but the apartment is located on quiet little canal.  The apartment was spacious and had a great view of the nearby canal.  Carolijn's neighbor Erica was a wonderful host and very responsive.  We would not hesitate to stay here again. 
67009381,"I enjoyed my stay at Nima's place.I felt like I'm at home. He was kind and helpful. The location is great, close to the central of Amsterdam, there is a bus station near. I recomend other travelers to stay there. I will definetly stay another time at his place if i was in Amsterdam. Thank you Nima :) "
67103911,"This apartment is in a great location near the museums, good tap rooms and the wonderful Heineken Experience.  Safe neighborhood, very accessible bus service. Unit is in a quiet building facing a courtyard and on a low traffic street. It is modern, clean, white and bright. There are 2 steep flights of stairs to access the unit on arrival, however the AirBnB office sent a staff member to assist. Upon departure we slid our heavy luggage all the way down to the small vestibule.  The staff members were helpful with directions, extra maps and discount offers.  The taxi service from the airport that they recommended was excellent, had a very good flat rate and saved us a lot of money.  "
67177035,"A nice and specious apartment in an authentic Dutch neighbourhood. The host had everything prepared for us when we arrived. He has a very nice list of places to visit around town which I highly recommend you take advantage of. The only issue was that we couldn't connect to the wifi from our iPhones, yet laptops worked well."
67181358,"Vooraf goede communicatie en bij aankomst een warm ontvangst. Voldoende privé door de afzonderlijke toegang en eigen badkamer. Ideale uitvalsbasis om de stad te bezoeken, ook voldoende winkeltjes en eetgelegenheden in de buurt. Wij komen zeker terug :)"
67198581,"Good Room with a uncomfortable shower, because it has no container for the water. Beautiful neighborhood."
67204166,"This AirBnB did not disappoint! The ship was exactly as pictured on the site, Anita and Edward were extremely welcoming and gave great advice on areas to visit, and the location was very central. Would highly recommend this as a place to stay while in Amsterdam!"
67215634,"The apartment is beautiful! It's very light and open, with a great view! Viola met us upon arriving and gave us a lot of tips and was very kind. I would definitely go back here, the location of the apartment is good and the street where it's situated is really cozy. Would totally recommend! "
67242986,Our stay at Laura and Arjan's was really great! The appartement is lovely and very comfortable. The location is great. Nice breakfast brought to our door. Arjan was really helpful. They are both really kind people. Highly recommended!!
67307541,"Great apartment, great location and Roman was very hospitable and flexible. Myself and my family had a wonderful time."
67582172,Laura's place was absolutely fantastic and her and her family at wonderful hosts and all around great people. They told us some great restaurant recommendations and were very kind and welcoming. The place was also amazing - right in the historic center of Amsterdam and a fairly short walk to a lot of the great sites. We had a wonderful time thanks to them!
67740240,"Toetsie is a very nice lady that help to call text and give advice to go around city. Though room is not big but cozy and warm, btw I love the block in wienjistraat."
67869583,"I loved staying at Francesco's place. He made me feel welcomed and informed me of all the transportation and it was clear directions, enjoyed privacy, while at the same time knowing He was around if I needed something. Will recommend staying there + Tram is at the doorstep very convenient "
67870261,"Great host even thou i didnt get a chance to meet with her , the house was great...and the location was top!...i would stay here again!"
67894916,"The apparent is extremely close to the tram and easy to access, both day and night. The living room and kitchen are fully equipped and we had a really good time cooking there, with the supermarket right around the corner. Judith wasn't there upon our arrival, but her nice friend was there to show us the place.<br/>Unfortunately the apartment fits families more than a group of friends. The master bedroom didn't have a door. Also upon our arrival, we found that the first floor toilets were broken, leaving us with one toilet for five people on the third floor."
67971249,"Ingo was great, the apartment couldn't be better located.<br/>Central , close to Tram , restaurants, activities , parking and supermarket.<br/>I forgot my laptop, contacted Ingo, immediately he offered to send it to me anyway I wanted.<br/>Wifi is excellent, washer and dryer are perfect<br/>Great place, great host."
67996729,"Micha was a great host! He let my boyfriend check-in before coming to get me at the airport, and gave him the grand tour and keys while staying in contact with me. His place is very close to the Biljmer Arena train station, with a small grocery store on the way. Short 10 minute ride to the city center. The apartment was fully equipped for cooking and we felt very comfortable!"
68130492,"We absolutely loved our stay at the apartment. It was very cozy, the shower nice and big. Sebastian was a great host, very easy check-in and checkout, he gave us great tips concerning restaurants and using the tram. The tram stop right in front of the flat is perfect, it takes 20 minutes to get into the city center.<br/>We would always come back, thank you very much for making our trip perfect!"
68258854,It was very nice!!
68435566,"This is a conveniently situated house in a quiet and beautiful area of Amsterdam. Saskia and her husband are wonderful hosts and helped us out enormously. It was rather cold upon arrival but they put the heating on for us and brought us provisions and offered advice on transport, eating out etc. The main downside for us was that only the upper floor (4 bedrooms and gorgeous modern bathroom) were made available to us as the family were staying downstairs. This was therefore quite cramped for a party of 4 individuals and although breakfast was provided as compensation, the same price was charged as for the whole house. This meant we couldnt cook for ourselves. There was a small table to eat at but insufficient chairs to sit at it comfortably and no where other than a large bed in one room for ""lounging"" on. Nevertheless, we had a great time and really enjoyed meeting this lovely couple: they definately went the extra mile in providing for our ""high maintenance"" party (getting in gluten free provisions for breakfast, providing ice for an injured ankle and ordering a taxi when walking became difficult!). "
68483754,Our vacation in vibeke's house was great. The place was very nice and she is absolutely kind and likeable. Thanks vibeke! :) 
68536203,"We really enjoyed our stay at the B&B.  The house is beautiful and Petra was a very warm and welcoming host. The B&B is situated in a great location, right next to Vondelpark, which makes the short walk/cycle into town a very pleasant experience. We loved our second stay at Vondelpark.  Perfect B&B."
68616625,Tutto fantastico 
68705072,"Das Apartment von Edwin ist der ideale Ort, um perfekte Tage in Amsterdam zu verbringen. Es ist sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet und großzügig. Es ist sehr ruhig und hat einen weiten Blick vom Wohnzimmer aus. Der Süd-West-Balkon nach hinten mit Blick in den schnuckeligen, riesigen Innenhof (inkl. Graureiher) ist traumhaft, um dort Mahlzeiten einzunehmen oder gemütlich zu sitzen.<br/>Nahe der Location ist ein Parkhaus, in dem man mit Vorausbuchung für 10 Euro/Tag sein Auto abgeben kann und ermäßigt Fahrräder bekommt. Mit dem Fahrrad sind es nur 5 Minuten zurück zum Apartment. Zum grünen Westerpark kommt man von Edwin aus in 2 Minuten und an die erste Gracht in 4 Minuten. Zum Centrum radelt man ca. 10-15 Minuten, je nach Antritt. Direkt nebenan ist ein großer Supermarkt, der sogar sonntags geöffnet hat und in dem man alles kaufen kann, was man braucht. <br/>Edwin hat sich toll um uns gekümmert und stand jederzeit für Rückfragen zur Verfügung. Auch das ein- und Auschecken war voll auf unsere Wünsche abgestimmt. <br/>Wenn wir wieder nach Amsterdam fahren...und das werden wir ganz bestimmt... werden wir auf jeden Fall versuchen, wieder dort zu übernachten. Uns hat es super gefallen und wir können diese Unterkunft voll und ganz empfehlen."
68713575,Sheryl is a great host.  She is excellent with communication and made us feel so welcome with her follow up and tips.  The apartment is located in a cute residential area called Oost.  There are excellent restaurants nearby and it is conveniently located close to a metro and bus stop.  It takes about 20 minutes to get into the city center via public transit but it was nice to be in a quieter area.  We loved staying at this apartment and had no troubles with our stay. 
68954976,"Marga and Rico were such lovely hosts, and the cottage such a cozy home to stay. This was my first trip traveling solo, and they made me feel right at home. From the pickup at the train station to their patience and warmth with a few traveling mishaps of mine, I felt like part of the family. I would highly recommend this cottage stay to anybody."
69092637,"Had a lovely stay with Petra! Very private room was spotless and has home comforts like soft water which was lovely. The bottle of water left for our arrival was well received too! The location is a little bit far out if you're looking for nightlife in the centre however if you're looking for a relaxing stay next to beautiful parks and nice restaurants then this is perfect! <br/>Cannot fault our stay with in this B&B at all everything was clean and new right down to the water pressure in the shower, very accessible to trams too and local bike rental which is a great way to see Amsterdam! <br/>Petra was lovely and helped us a lot with what to do and where to go for food and bikes ECT. Would definitely stay again! "
69173708,"Our recent stay at the guest house was amazing! The room is gorgeous, and looks just as it does in the pictures. The shower and bed are particular highlights - seriously so comfy, I already miss sleeping there. Petra was a great host. She was quick to answer any queries and the breakfast served in our room was amazing. She even cooked additional food at our request. All in all we loved our stay. I am definately going to recommend the guesthouse to my friends and family. The location is good for transport links as it is just a short walk from the tram stop so it's easy to get to both the centre of Amsterdam and the airport. Alternatively, you can also stroll through the park into town which is really picturesque and idyllic. There's even a few bars and cafes on the way which is lovely when the sun in shining."
69296812,"Laura's place is an absolute gem! Really clean, has everything you want, including a super comfy bed and breakfast delivered each morning. Laura and her husband made us feel very welcome. We loved it!"
69468121,"Words cannot describe how amazing this booking is!  The whole house is exactly like in the pictures and Joke & Gerrad make you feel so welcome and part of the family. They are fantastic hosts who give you the local tips on best places to eat/visit etc. Our time with them was magical and we can't wait to book again. Gerrad's canal trip is much much better than the commercial ones you can book, he is very knowledgable. If you are looking at visiting Amsterdam this is the place to stay!!!!! "
69493625,"Cute little room in the absolute middle of everything. I walked everywhere I needed to go from there. It's also close to a multitude of shops, cafés and restaurants that were fantastic to discover. "
69496378,"Nice location, nice environment and nice host! 地理位置非常好，可以走路到任何地方包括市中心dam square，边拍照边欣赏阿姆斯特丹的风景。Ifigenia非常友好并且送了我们Christmas cake和饼干～推荐给所有的房客！Happy to meet you! We all like your lovely son!!!"
69601210,Toplocatie vlakbij het Vondelpark en museum district! We zijn er hartelijk ontvangen en alles was tiptop in orde. Echt een aanrader!
69912403,"We have had the most incredible weekend staying with Laura in Amsterdam. The facilities were well maintained, impeccably clean and comfortable and just a short walk from the city centre. Laura and her family suggested two fantastic restaurants with both different and stimulating culinary experiences which are both unforgettable and off the beaten path. I would most definitely recommend staying here and as I've promised we will visit them again. "
69922481,"A tranquil place with helpful people. Sonia and Ben are smart, nice and helpful hosts. Their house is in a dutch suburban area named Molenwijk away from the crowd and rush of the city, and directly adjacent to a water canal. Their yard is such a beauty in the morning. If you take the bus, it takes around 20 minutes from the Centraal, which was quite reasonable for us and practically easy. If you are late night sort of people, night bus goes through just a street down. We had a very nice journey in Amsterdam and accomodation was one of the bright sides. <br/><br/>Just they need to make sure that the sheets are changed and clean after each guest so that cleanliness-sensitive people like us will not have suspicions. ;)<br/><br/>Recommended."
69976141,"Alles perfekt organisiert!! Infos für die Schlüsselübergabe kamen knapp 1 Woche vor Anreise. Super Lage mit nur 5min zu Fuß vom Hauptbahnhof gleich am Beginn von Red Light District und China Town. Einzige Herrausforderung mit großem, schwerem Kopfer...war die typisch holländische steile Stiege in den ersten Stock zum Zimmer. Sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet! Kleiner Kühlschrank und Geschirr für Frühstück und kleine Mahlzeiten vorhanden!<br/>Perfekt für ein Sightseeing Wochenende!!"
70042897,"Our host was fantastic! She provided us with lots of useful information about Amsterdam and was always a quick message away if we needed any advice or guidance! She gave us an insight into the real Amsterdam and make us feel incredibly welcome!! The studio was stunning and identical to the pictures, the location was also fantastic for our sightseeing adventues! We had a wonderful stay in such a chic apartment, with really comfortable beds, a clean bathroom and modern living space. We are already talking about coming to stay here again!"
70056840,"While our stay in this apartment was nice there were a few things we had an issue with. The first (minor) was that I had chosen places to stay based on having a washing machine as I was traveling light and in Europe for a number of weeks. When I asked Karlijn how to use it she said she didn't let guests use it but that she would wash my clothes. When I said yes, she then said her dryer didn't work and it would be better to wash my clothes at home as they would be wet for the trip. This was disappointing as I was leaving for Madrid the next day and was in need of some clean clothes. The washing machine should be taken off the list of amenities.<br/> <br/>The second (MAJOR) issue was that on the morning we were leaving very early to catch our flight, the door would not open. It has to be opened with a key from the inside (which is a fire hazard to begin with) but the key was not turning. After trying for 1/2 hour I called Karljin. She told us she would come after work at 8:30 (which would be 2.5 hours later and after my sister's flight left at 8). We told her that wasn't acceptable so she agreed to come home. She said she thought she knew what it was but was not sure she would be able to get it open either and that she needed to tell guests not to lock something from the outside. I wasn't sure what she meant but the way she phrased it led me to believe something similar has happened before. Upon arriving, she too could not get the door open from the outside. Her neighbor tried as well with no luck. In the end, knowing we would otherwise miss our flights, my brother climbed over the balcony (2nd floor) in the back garden onto a step ladder her neighbor had, we passed down all of our luggage to him balancing on this step ladder, and then climbed down ourselves with some help from him. Thankfully we are all fit and flexible but it was a dangerous situation where someone could have easily broken a leg (or worse). To get to the airport quickly we ended up taking a cab instead of the tram which cost much more. On a positive note, my sister ended up just making her flight and I'm sure ""that time we got stuck in our Air BnB"" will be a story we tell for years to come. <br/> <br/>This apartment is very nice. Without the last morning I would have left a different review but I feel both the situation and Karljin's initial reaction were not what I expect from an Air BnB booking. Karljin did inform me the lock is now fixed."
70062691,"Nancy was a great host - extremely fast communication and very welcoming. <br/>Bar a few minor issues with the shower, the apartment was 10/10 - super spacious and had everything we could possible need. It's a very modern apartment and has ample space to comfortably accommodate a group of 6-8.<br/>Highly recommended"
70114307,Logement parfait ! Maison chaleureuse et accueillante avec un extérieur pour profiter du beau temps ! Je recommande vivement ! A proximité des transports et du centre ! 
70169924,"Marieke was at home when we arrived at our designated time, also had with here a representative from a rental service.  It was helpful for him to be there as the luggage needed to be carried up the stairs (it is on the third floor with one very long, steep set of stairs, very Amsterdam!).  We discussed her home and the neighborhood and after a while she left us to enjoy her home.  Very well decorated and everything worked as it should have.  We loved the view, both down into the little yards in back and out the balcony in front.  Very enjoyable apartment and great location.  Being near the Vondelpark was awesome.  The first day we walked through and the second we had bikes and covered it thoroughly with a bottle of wine and picnic supplies.  Loved it.  Thanks for sharing your home Marieke!!"
70301720,"We really enjoyed ourselves in Emily's flat. Since we wanted to see all of Amsterdam and not just the city centre, we found the flat very conveniently located, close to public transport, with easy access everywhere.<br/><br/>Emily's flat itself is tastefully furnished, the neighbours were not a problem at all. We had privacy and quiet and were very happy there.<br/><br/>Nabil from airbnb was polite and a real help, a true gentleman.<br/><br/>In short, we have only good things to say about the airbnb experience and would recommend it for everyone."
70333347,"Un studio agréable, bien situé , un hôte disponible et accueillant soucieux du bien-être des occupants. Bonne adresse !"
70335928,Laura and her family made Lily and I feel very welcomed in Amsterdam! The apartment was very big and spotless! Seriously some on the nicest people you will ever meet! We can't wait to visit again! 
70385857,"Anne-Marie was very helpful and easy to deal with. It's a nice apartment, as presented in the listing, with a small garden that was great on sunny days. Calm neighbourhood, but still within walking distance of everything. Would definitively recommend."
70497953,"Very stylish and comfortable apartment on the second floor, quiet neighborhood quite close to Vondel Park. Easy to get to Van Gogh and Rijksmuseum, as well as local grocery and other shops. Convenient to tram #2 to get into the city center. We enjoyed it very much - thanks! "
70674463,"Superverblijf gehad. De check in en check uit waren erg flexibel en dat was vooral door mijn drukke en volle programma zeer fijn. Francois heeft me zeer fijn welkom geheten. De kamer en het appartementje zelf waren netjes, gezellig en knus. Ik heb er heerlijk geslapen en ik zou voor een volgende trip naar Amsterdam hier zeker naar terug gaan. "
70692849,"I enjoyed my stay very much! I rented a bike! First time bicycling in Amsterdam. It was funny! I survived! <br/><br/>Nice hospitality! I can really recomend this guesthouse! Nice people!"
70693997,"We had a wonderful time at Karen's place in Amsterdam. The apartment had everything we needed and was lovely. The location was ideal as well... Close to a grocery and some cafes and bakeries, and within walking distance or close to transit to other areas we wanted to visit. We happened to be there at the hottest time of the year, so the fans in the apartment were greatly appreciated. We would definitely stay again."
70698438,"The flat is located 10 min. metro ride from centre. The metro station is just behind the corner. Free parking near the flat.<br/>Micha was great host and provided us with everything we needed. "
70699879,"IWe were looking for a good place to spend time with my brothers and we were not disappointed . Gina's Garden House is a quiet and beautiful place and Gina is a wonderful host she gave us everything we need to enjoy our stay . We found our stay in Amsterdam for our next travels .<br/><br/>Thank you again Gina see you soon !"
70725340,"Great host, very accommodating--went as far as helping us bring baggage up and doing a load of laundry for us. Super good about communication. Adorable cat too! Great location, central to everything. "
70829418,"This was not a good experience.  We stayed here in a ""perfect 2 bedroom APT in CITY CENTER"" for 3 nights, and the place itself probably would have been fine, had we been prepared for what it actually looked like, and if had been ready for us when we arrived. In reality, this place is VERY hard to enter.  There is a VERY steep staircase  to get down to the BASEMENT apartment, and I would never bring small children or elderly people here.  <br/><br/>When we arrived it was after 5PM, yet the cleaners had not come and the place was filthy.  Paul;ine did not greet us - instead she sent a young man who knew very little about the city, or anything having to do with the apartment. He clearly felt terrible about the state of the apartment, but couldn't do anything about it.  It does not show well, when it is this dirty! There was a broken closet door just leaning up against a wall in one bedroom. <br/><br/>They asked us to lock all windows and doors when we left, but when i tried to bolt the back door, the lock just popped off.  It seemed like the previous guests had caused some damage, but no one had bothered to check this out before we arrived.  <br/><br/>When they say there is no kitchen, they mean it.  there is a tiny fridge and a nespresso maker, but no pods for you to use, and no sink to rinse cups.<br/><br/>Pauline's profile says she rents out her home when she is away, yet she seems to have multiple listings.  I believe this is her business - managing apartments. Therefore she has reviews for many differnt apartments posted in the same place - make sure you are actually reading a review for the apartment you want to rent.  This was my first time using Airbnb though i have used VRBO/Homeaway many times.  I was very disappointed with this experience. I find Airbnb to be very misleading, and much harder to use.    <br/><br/>The neighborhood was delightful, and the place eventually worked out for us. It is way over priced - after fees I paid nearly $1000 for 3 days.  I do not recommend it."
70865721,"We arrived at the agreed time but our host had other engagements so simply shook hands, asked if we needed anything and left. As we were a family of six trailing cases through a city it would have been nice to get an introductory chat with some basic guidelines. Maybe my expectations are wrong as this is the first time we have used Air bnb. I could not fault the house and personally liked the surrounding area. The public transportation was very good which was a great help. The house itself had everything in it that was advertised and the host accommodated us by adding an extra two beds. Overall we had a great stay in a very nice house in a nice area of Amsterdam."
70957503,Micha is absolutely kind and friendly. His house is perfact location and close to metro. I recommend this house strongly...
70976216,"I stayed at Toetsie's place for a long weekend. I arrived rather late at night but she made me feel at home right away. Her apartment is located in a quiet neighbourhood yet close to all the main attractions. As the weather was rather grey and rainy, I took public transport (both tram and metro stations are close by) most of the times but you can easily make your way to the centre along a scenic route on the Amstel river by foot. I stayed in the one person room at Toetsie's. The room isn't big but it has everything and more you need. The living room is cozy, comfortable and nicely decorated with lots of personal touches. Toetsie even had some food for me for the first night and morning. To cut a long story short: A much recommended place, if you go to Amsterdam. Thanks for everything!"
71063632,"I believe that the founders of airbnb had Cecile's hosting in mind when they started airbnb. <br/><br/>Cecile is the perfect airbnb-er! Responsive, helpful, flexible and accommodating, All arrangements and final details were easy. That feeling of the unknown dissipates as Cecile answered every inquiry about key pickup/drop off, transportation's etc. She made us feel at home even before we got there.<br/>* Communication - Perfect! <br/><br/>The apartment is true to the photos, full of light, immaculately clean and pleasant. Bedding, toiletries, kitchen utensils, maps, things to do, everything we needed on our stay was provided as promised. <br/>* Apartment - Perfect!<br/><br/>The neighborhood is quiet. Its location is a 10 minute walk to the RAI train station which has access to many parts of Holland and just a 10 minute ride to Schiphol. <br/>The house is also a 10 minute tram from the city center or a lovely 40 minute walk. <br/>If you are traveling by car, its very close to the ring roads getting you out of the city in no time with minimal traffic.<br/>* Location - Perfect!<br/><br/>I highly recommend Cecile's place,<br/>Thanks Cecile for making our stay comfortable.<br/><br/>Tip for renting a car:<br/>If you plan to stay in Amsterdam only, don't rent a car. However if you plan to travel around Holland like we did, parking is free from 21:00-9:00 and on Sundays. Not on those hours its 2.4 euro an hour. <br/>We never had a problem finding a spot near the apartment.<br/>Since we were out most of the day, parking at 21:00 worked for us. We returned the car two days before we left Holland and that's when we toured Amsterdam.<br/>There are hotels located by the RAI station like europecar and Hertz so you can pick up the car at Shpichol and return it there or vice versa.<br/><br/>Tip for Shabbat/Kosher observers: <br/>Kosher stores are located on on Kastelenstraat. A 20 minute walk from the house.<br/>On Saturday we parked the car on Kastelenstraat where parking was free on Saturdays too. Friday parking is free from 19:00. "

71274392,"Olaf was a fantaststic host and made us feel very welcome at all times. His home was extremely clean and well kept; it was everything we expected plus more.<br/>The location was great for us and had lots of places to eat and visit locally alongside other points of interest being very easy to get to. <br/>Olaf insured any information we needed he could provide which included the hiring of bikes. <br/>Thank you Olaf for a great couple of days.

71301785,"We visited Roderik's appartment for the IBC 2016 (RAI) visiting with 2 other colleagues (total 3 peoples), Roderik was not able to meet us during arrival, but he informed us in advance, his friends met us and help with everything, very nice girls! Everything was available in appart. as we expected, Roderik left usefull instructions. <br/><br/>Totally it is nice silence place, supermarket is 100m far, train station and tram also not far (as for us, walking each day to RAI was not a problem for us, even we had a lot of fun!). From Amsterdam Central there is tram #2 almost to the appart. Roderik appart. has small garden, which was very pleasantly for all of us. Flat is specious enough for 3 peoples for sure, I think for 4 peoples there will be enough place too.<br/><br/>Thx Roderik, hope we will visit You again!"

71451486,We had a lovely stay at Carolien's place ... It was clean and tidy and she was very informative when we arrived ... The area is very cool with the park a stones throw away and restaurants and a supermarket just round the corner ... We hired bikes from Ton's place and it was about a 10-15 minute leisurely cycle into town. Would definitely stay again!
71493184,Beautiful home in a very quiet and peaceful neighborhood. Plenty of room for 4 people if not more. My 3 friends and I absolutely loved it. Nicola was extremely helpful leaving a list of restaurant recommendations. It was so sweet! If I ever find myself back in Amsterdam I will definitely look to stay here again!

71693849,Die Wohnung ist sehr zentral gelegen! Reibungsloser Check-In und -Out. Wir durften am Abreisetag sogar unser Gepäck bis am Nachmittag in der Wohnung lassen. Kate war nett.  Bereitstellung der Handtücher erst auf Nachfrage.
71769575,Very nice stay at Marga's.  Thank you for all
71795812,"We loved Petra's place. Room is perfect, with en-suite and also a shared kitchen. Excellent location to airport. The location is fantastic; very close to the City but also far enough away to be a quiet haven to come back to in the evening. <br/>The communication from Petra was excellent and directions to her house were perfect. Her welcome was great and she happily shared her tips for Amsterdam to us"
71798082,Great appartment near to city centre. With Judith as a friendly host. We enjoyed the last weekend pretty much.
71879494,This Airbnb is perfect for two or three travelers. The rooms are spacious and well equipped. It is walking distance from a beautiful park and many of Amsterdam's main attractions. The tram stop is also right next to the apartment and so it is easy to access city center that way as well. Marian and her husband were so kind and helpful. Definitely recommend booking this Airbnb! 
71939743,Our stay in the apartment was excellent - No complaints! Ingo's apartment is beautifully furnished and fully equipped with essentially everything you could want or possibly need during your stay and located on a quiet section of the Singel canal very close to Koningsplein with many shops and restaurants nearby. Check in/out process was super easy and convenient. Would recommend to any couple wanting to spend anywhere from just a few nights or a lengthier amount of time in Amsterdam!
72068630,"We were very happy with our apartment, Kate's place. They were very kind and flexible, meeting us and accommodating our needs. We have never been to Amsterdam, so we had no idea about the steps that are in most apartments in the city. We highly recommend this apartment for young and healthy people or very healthy older people, who can climb very steep steps.We also recommended packing light and to utilize public transportation, instead info of driving a car. In all we were very happy with our stay, the location and the kindness of the Dutch people. "
72094748,Petra was very caring. Already the day before she had inquired about our arrival time. The room was made available ahead of time and we were welcomed with good and strong coffee. Petra answered all our inquiries and offered her assistance (e.g. parking ticket). 
72190746,"Joke is such a lovely person! We had a great time with her and her apartment was really nice and clean. She made a delicious breakfast for us and she helped us with any doubts we had about the city. She is a wonderful host, do not hesitate to book your stay with her. We hope to see you soon Joke! "
72231330,"Frank was very helpful and welcome us when we arrived from the airport. The apartment was really nice, comfy bed and a nice balcony. The apartment have it's own shower and toilet which we liked. Good distance from the city center with only about 6-10 minutes with tram from the apartment area. A bit sensitively/noicy in the apartment, both from the other apartments around and from the courtyard. Anyway, I would come back if I visit Amsterdam again!   "
72251396,Merles apartment was the perfect place to stay. It was very cozy and had everything we needed. The apartment is localized a bit outside the center but the transportation communication is great and with bicycle there is no distance. I would definitely stay there again. Thank you Merle :)
72591351,She welcomed us with open arms! She picked us up from the tram station and told us all about Amsterdam. 
72637586,"We just spent the weekend at the Mansion and had a really good time. There was 13 of us so this was the perfect place to stay. All bedrooms and bathrooms were great just don't forget a shower cap as there are no handheld showers. We turned one of the bedrooms into a chill out room as the dinning table room was quite small and not as comfortable. The location is great, 7mins to lidl for daily essential shopping and there are some nice bars/pubs/restaurants close by. Overall a great experience."
72646758,"Excellent séjour dans ce bel et typique appartement avec sa terrasse donnant sur les toits d'Amsterdam. Situé en plein centre, cet appartement offre la possibilité de visiter facilement la ville et ces canaux à pied. <br/>Certes les escaliers sont raides et les poignées de portes ne tiennent pas très bien, mais le lieu est vraiment agréable et empreint des caractéristiques qui font de la ville ce qu'elle est. <br/> Nous espérons renouveler l'expérience rapidement. <br/>Merci Ralf !! "
72997094,"A huge thank to Marga , Rico and their children for their hospitality and kindness. I felt like home. The cottage is adorable and the place you have created is beautiful. Also thank you for the advice, help, vegan cookies, bike and delicious breakfast . You have so much to share, and I enjoyed meeting you and talking with you at sunday morning. <br/>If you are looking for a comfortable place, close to nature, created by a generous family, don't hesitate !"
73234010,"El apartamento de Stephanie y Sebastian fue perfecto. Muy comodo y no le falta de nada. Nos sentimos muy agusto alli. Esta muy bien ubicado, delante de una parada del tranvia. Barrio tranquilo y sin ruido aunque muy cerca de supermercados y cafeteria. Los anfitriones fueron estupendos, nos ayudaron en todo, muy comunicativos y dispuestos a resolver las dudas. Recomiendo el piso a todo el mundo."
73338514,"Our host is the most welcoming person and is very flexible regarding the arrival hours, it was really practical and nice.<br/><br/>The bed is confortable, and we have access to wifi. The house is clean and is charming.<br/><br/>Everything is there, towels, pillows, slippers, cooking tools, etc.<br/><br/>A fantastic experience and I warmly recommend you Toetsie. She takes the time to share some nice places to go, where to find bikes, etc.<br/><br/>Rocky the ginger cat is very sweet ;)<br/><br/><br/><br/>"
73467644,This apartment was great!!! Situated in vivid neighborhood with cafes and restaurants. The apartment is actually bigger then showen in the pictures! I am for sure gonna try to book with Mark next time I visit Amsterdam :)<br/>Thank you Mark!!

73585905,"We checked in very late and the host waited for us personally, which was very nice and helpful. The breakfasts were amazing, the hosts were sensitive to our dietary restrictions. The hosts w ere very helpful in advising where to go and what Amsterdam has to offer. The appartment is very nicely decorated, spacious, and comfortable. The roof terrace is a great bonus. Great location.<br/>All together, we are very satisfied."
73704030,"We liked this house very much, and the organization was perfect. We were very lucky to have found this place. Thank you!"
73788387,"Nous avons été accueillis avec le sourire, et la bonne humeur. Le logement était conforme à la description, et le quartier très calme . Petit plus, le tramway est au pied de l'immeuble."
73804701,Daan's place was wonderful! Everything was exactly as described with no surprises. Daan was very welcoming and was great company. He and his sister know the area well and were very helpful as it was our first time in the city. <br/>The local area has everything you'd need for your day to day routine with a shop just around the block and frequent trams and buses into the city. <br/>We had a great stay at Daan's and would recommend it to anyone wanting to experience Amsterdam! 
73886517,Nice place and location. Near many attractions and lovely. Bike rental area is very close by. The room is comfortable and the check-in process was very smooth<br/>It is very small. It would be nice to know the actual size beforehand. Also the stairs up are brutal and it would have been nice to have k ow that beforehand.
73901114,"2 bestfriends, 2 days, 2 nights<br/>It was a great time in Amsterdam because of Marga and her family. The accommodation was totally lovely and everything felt like a summer's tale. We had breakfast with Marga and her husband and enjoyed the homemade omelets. Furthermore we rent bicycles to go to the city by bike (took 20min) and was the best thing to do!<br/>We plan to stay there again and recommend this cozy place near the Amstel !"
73964052,Très beau studio tout équipé pour pouvoir prendre un petit-déjeuner et manger grâce au micro-onde et mini-frigo mis à disposition - Très bon accueil de notre hôte qui nous a donné une brochure en français (ce que nous avons vraiment apprécié) sur Amsterdam et donné les explications et informations nécessaires à notre séjour - Nous étions à Amsterdam pour le Marathon et nous avons apprécié que notre hôte prennent de nos nouvelles et nous demandent comment s'était passé notre course - Tram en face l'entrée de l'appartement avec accès direct au Centre ville en 15 minutes maximum - beaucoup de restaurants dans le quartier et tous commerces à proximité - Nous recommandons vivement ce studio pour un séjour à Amsterdam.
74070385,"The host was ok. The room was clean. The kitchen and living room smelled of their dogs. You can´t use the kitchen, what was a bit sad. We only wanted to eat breakfast, but it is not allowed, after a few times asking we we´re allowed to get a bowl for cornflakes.<br/>The room is very central, great place to walk everything. "
74193569,"Marga is a sweet lady. Very welcoming and hospitable. <br/><br/>The guest house is spacious and comfortable. "
74459447,"Polecam to mieszkanie. Pomimo że przez kłopoty w podróży zamiast na 19 dojechaliśmy do Amsterdamu o 4, gospodarz nas bardzo serdecznie przywitał, nie robił z tego powodu żadnych problemów.  Przed przyjazdem był z nim bardzo łatwy kontakt, a mieszkanie okazało się bardzo przyjemne i zgodne z opisem z oferty. Dodatkowo gospodarz przygotował dla nas sałatkę i pieczywo gdybyśmy byli głodni po podroży, było to bardzo miłe!"
74479128,"<br/>My flight was delayed so I texted Corina that I would arrive later  during the night than expected. Luckily, the journey from the airport to Corina's home was very easy and safe. Corina stayed up and greeted me. She was a bright, friendly and helpful host. She took the time to show me around the room & how to make coffee/tea. She asked me what my plans were and showed me on a map a suggested itinerary for each day of places to eat and walk to. I was able to walk to all the sights and was happy to return to my room in the beautiful Jordaan to rest in the comfortable bed or relax in the garden. I had a wonderful stay. "
74576067,Micha was very user friendly and he maintain his apartment clean and neat.   We wish to stay once again.
74595290,Great place to stay while in Amsterdam. The room was big compared to most rooms and hotels. Bed was comfy. It was an all around great experience. Thanx for everything David. You helped make our 1st Amsterdam experience great. I will advise everyone taking in Amsterdam to use caution. I had my wallet stolen one evening while strolling around the red light district. One can't be too careful.
74668587,"Mark Jan's apartment is bright, spacious and quirky. The bedroom is also cosy and comfortable; a pleasant place to relax in front of the TV after spending the day in the lively city centre. The area that the apartment in is great - a different, more relaxing, feeling to right in the centre. It seems neighbourly and has great cafés, places to eat and Katsu (our favourite coffee shop), just a 5 minute walk from the front door! Mark Jan is very friendly, makes you feel welcome and right at home. The arrival process was very smooth, and took a matter of minutes. Mark Jan was quick to respond to my messages throughout the whole process. Thank you for a great stay and hopefully see you again! "
74752110,My three friends and I stayed in Marks place for two nights and had a wonderful experience both in his place and Amsterdam. Great location easy to get to Dam Square and Central Station from the tram. Apt is right next to Heineken experience. Mark was very accommodating (let us checkin early and check out later) along with great recommendation of places to eat. Thank you! 
74838138,"Location, quality, value. Everything you will possibly need."
74850108,"La maison d'Iva est très accueillante, bien équipée, agréablement décorée. Tout est à la hauteur des attentes : les pièces sont spacieuses, la cuisine très complète et la salle de bains parfaite. Le dîner dans le jardin est un vrai plus. Le quartier est calme et rend accessible tout le nord d'Amsterdam à vélo. Les indications et conseils laissés par Iva sont simples et utiles, de même que les plans pour les visites. Le chat est tranquille et sociable.<br/>Nous avons beaucoup apprécié cet endroit !<br/>"
74895802,"The apartment is amazing!!! You can walk anywhere from the apartment and if you don't wan't to walk, there are bus/tram stops nearby. <br/>The location is awesome, is 10 minute walk from supermarkets, restaurants and other stores. Amsterdam central station is 15-20 minutes away from the apartment.<br/><br/>The apartment looks amazing in the pictures, and when you get there it is way better. It's incredible!<br/><br/>But the most important thing was the reception. From the beginning Viola & Daniel sent a lot of useful information of the city, very helpful for a first time visit to amsterdam in order to have local recommendations.<br/>Viola was waiting for us when we arrived and she was very kind. We loved her hospitality and during our stay we felt like home.<br/><br/>Very satisfied with the experience, with the hosts and the apartment.<br/><br/>I reccommend it 100%"
75147131,"We had a great time at caroline's apartment during our 5 night stay.<br/>Wieke was very nice and welcoming, she gave us some useful tips!<br/>Great apartment, Great location, Quiet yet close to all the awesome places."
75149292,Great location easy to get in and  out of the centre of town highly recommended 
75234851,Luchiena est une hôte charmante qui a tout fait pour nous faciliter la vie durant notre séjour. son petit-déjeuner à la carte est copieux et délicieux ! La chambre est grande et assez lumineuse bien qu'en sous-sol et le quartier en bordure de la rivière Amstel est très agréable.  je recommande vivement Luchiena pour un séjour à Amsterdam !
75404321,"Wir sind von vornherein gefragt worden, wie und wann wir Anreisen und haben eine super Route bekommen zum Zimmer. Wir hatten uns zwar für einen direkten Bus entschieden, den uns Alexander nicht genannt hatte, ich war trotztem sehr dankbar für seine Tipps.<br/>Natasha hat uns dann empfangen, was ich als sehr angenehm empfunden habe. Auch hat sie uns den ein oder anderen Tipp gegeben für Amsterdam. Unkompliziert war die Frage nach der Uhrzeit für unser Frühstück, da sie sich da komplett nach uns gerichtet hat und uns zusätzlich noch ein Lunchpaket mit auf den Weg gegeben hat. <br/>Ein sehr süßes kleines Haus, was mit den Gastgebern geteilt wird. Alles war sauber und ordentlich. Wie meine Vorgänger auch schon geschrieben haben, für Personen, die keine engen Treppen laufen können jedoch nicht zu empfehlen, da das Bad im ersten Stock liegt. <br/>Verkehrsanbindung ist super, da die Bahn um die Ecke ost und direkt zur Central Station fährt. Dazwischen wird alles abgefahren, was man als Tourist gesehen haben muss.  "
75437474,Det här var första gången vi bokade boende via AirBnB och det var en alltigenom positiv erfarenhet. Gabriella och John var supertrevliga och måna om att vi skulle känna oss som hemma. Lägenheten låg precis bredvid en kanal och ganska nära till centrum (vi behövde aldrig åka kollektivt). Rummet var snyggt och rent (precis som resten av lägenheten) och varje morgon fick vi en god och mättande frukost samt tips på saker vi kunde göra. Deras två urgulliga katter gjorde inte vistelsen sämre direkt. :)
75663671,Great place and great location! Would absolutely stay again when I'm back.
75968729,"Jeroen is a really nice person. He gave us a lot of advices about what we could do in his city, especially where the real people are going, not tourists only. The place is in the north but not far by buses or bike from the center, and both quiet and pretty."
76135707,"De hele ervaring was super!<br/>Lekker ontbijtje, lieve zorgen van de gastvrouw en grote flexibiliteit.<br/>"
76302489,"Dear Sella,<br/><br/>You have one of the nicest apartments ever. It was very clean and your bed is very cozy. Mano is a lovely cat who we will miss a lot! We enjoyed the restaurants in the area and the centrum wasnt far away! Thank you for one of the best trips Hannah and me ever made! <br/><br/>We wish you all the best :)"
76363747,"Genial! A la salida nos llevó al aeropuerto en coche, cosa que fue muy amable por su parte! Y al llegar nos ofreció unos waffles y panfletos informativos sobre Amsterdam. Era nuestra primera estancia en una casa via Airbnb y nos quedamos muy satisfechos y con muy buena impresión.<br/>Gracias Vibeke!! :D"
76397495,"I have been to Amsterdam many times, but this is the best place i have stayed so far. I was staying with another friend here for 3 days. Bikes and the tram takes you all over the city from this area. Its quiet at night, with very comfortable rooms and beds. <br/><br/>We got the best welcoming, where Kees took us out for a short bike ride around the neighborhood and showed us allot of nice places for eating etc. Everything in the house was as promised, and even better! :)<br/>We had the great pleasure to meet both Tamara and Kees!"
76509803,"The apartment was really clean and very modern. Alex answered to my messages really fast. He is super friendly and even provided us with a welcome present and we could use everything in the kitchen.<br/>The location of the apartment is great. The tram and the metro are right around the corner."
76588751,"The host was waiting for us, explained everything that was neede, was available on the phone to answer any question.<br/>The lovely and comfortable apatment is in a nice neighborhood, not in the center but not far.<br/> "
76784238,"Very lovely apartment, just like described. Close to everything, convenient. Fantastic airbnb experience!"
76852140,"I should have heeded the reviews about Ellen’s demeanor and behavior because she just wasn’t nice and she was actually insulting and quite aggressive. The 3 keys to her doors are a pain and don’t always turn properly on her “100+ year old” doors and checking in was not fun. She failed to list the 6:30am construction work going on daily 5 feet from the windows or that she would be screaming in the hallway and slamming doors at 8:30am. The room needs a coat of paint and new furnishings, including a new bed and sheets, blankets, and pillows. The bed was pretty gross. She did have bottled water for guests, which is the nicest thing I can say about the whole experience. I was at the end of a 3-week journey and it sucked having to deal with her and then just try to avoid her after a stellar journey to that point. She’s just a jaded, cheap, bitchy woman. Petra's space was absolutely perfect: spacious, spotless, exceptionally comfortable (divine rain shower), with excellent location on quiet and residentially oriented street directly off a major road with straight, quick access into the center. Excellent restaurant steps from the front door. Petra couldn't have been more kind and accommodating. Highly recommended, top notch!"
77073501,"La verdad es que nuestra estancia en Ámsterdam fue inmejorable, gracias a este apartamento. Por su ubicación, pudimos ir hacia todos lados caminando y disfrutamos mucho, también, del barrio. <br/>El apartamento es muy agradable. Quizás, las escaleras son demasiado empinadas, pero lo cierto es que no nos supuso mayor problema.<br/>Las habitaciones, muy cómodas y la vista de la azotea es fantástica.<br/>También queríamos agradecerle a Nathalie que estuviese pendiente de nosotros, para saber cómo habíamos llegado o si teníamos algun problema con la casa.<br/>Todo fue rodado y lo pasamos estupendamente.<br/>Gracias, Nathalie, por tu amabilidad. Recomendamos este apartamento, sin dudarlo."
77141384,"We didn't meet Pim but beers and wine wait us in the fridge when we arrive, that's cool. The appartment was clean, no surprise compared to pictures. Electric light in the living room and vent in the bathroom were not working well, but we can live with that. Neighbourhood is calm and easy to access from central station. Pim is easy to join and made things easy for us. We had a nice trip and this appartment is part of it. We were 5, it's maybe too much."
77287329,"Nuestra estadia en la casa de Klaartje (Bed ay Pander) fue muy buena, es una anfitriona de lujo y nos hizo sentir a mi hijo y a mí como si estuviéramos en casa. Nos dio toda la información que necesitábamos para manejarnos en nuestro paso por Amsterdam. ¡Nos hizo desayunos riquísimos! Hermosa experiencia."
77397352,"I never actually met my host, which might be part of the problem. The first day was rough, with guys smoking a lot of weed in the living room and loud music. I don't think pot is bad- I mean, this is Amsterdam we're talking about- but the smell has always made me sick to my stomach. Luckily the next day they left and the rest of my trip was okay."
77831170,We hebben een heerlijk weekend in Amsterdam gehad en Toetsies bnb was een super basiskamp voor alles wat we wilden doen in de omgeving. Toetsie is een goede en vriendelijke host en heeft leuke tips. <br/>De kamer was comfortabel en schoon. De katten zijn schattig en de koffie erg lekker. Tot de volgende keer. 
77930653,"I've been in Maaike's apartment with two friends and everything was perfect! Lovely place to stay, very warm (we traveled on November) and clean.<br/>Maaike could not receive us but Lex, her neighbor, showed us the apartment and told us about some questions of the city.<br/>Definitely I recommend staying in this apartment!"
78019322,"An amazing and relaxing stay in the most beautiful city in the world. The location is the best you can get, and in a city dominated by walking it is very very nice to have this. You are right down the street from everything you could want. The bed is actually two small beds pushed together, but other than that it a perfect and relaxing romantic getaway. Corina is extremely nice and very open to providing recomendations around the city."
78059046,"Love the flat, the apartment was even better than in the pictures and the location was superb. I would definitely chose this flat if I were going back to Amsterdam."
78103973,"Notre hote a été joingnable malgré notre arrivée tardive. <br/>Il nous a laissé de la nourriture et boisson, très agreable. <br/>Le quartier n est loin du centre ville. <br/>Nous avons été deçu de la difference qu il y avait entre la description sur le site et la realité. Nous pensions l appartement un peu plus grand. <br/>Nous avons passé un agreable sejour globalement. "
78151103,"I was in her home only for two days but Suzanne is a very nice person. She welcoming me with museum/restaurant suggestions and a pack of Dutch biscuits. The room was as in the pictures with a cozy balcony and the apartment is very clean and comfortable. I recommend it. But if you stay long, there isn't  wardrobe into the room."
78155543,"Ingo & Marlies are fantastic hosts and were an absolute pleasure to deal with. The apartment is amazing, great location, fully equipped and  great place to just chill and enjoy Amsterdam. <br/><br/>"
78174821,prefect room!
78190948,The room was clean and the bed was comfy. The bathroom has no door and you can't use the shower between 9-10am as she uses it. The location was alright but we had trouble getting to the city and back every day as we had to catch two trams!! 
78357481,"This place is just the best. Without a doubt my favorite airbnb. It's spacious, private, and completely unique to any other airbnb. The family is so hospitable, generous, and accommodating. If you're looking for an authentic Dutch-family living environment, this is it. I felt like a guest in their house and not a tenant to their property. There's absolutely nothing bad to say about this place. If you're in Amsterdam, sleep here. "
78872226,"Sebastian went out of his way to make me feel very welcome.   He provided me with very clear instructions on how to get to the property and gave me extra useful information to help me make the most of my stay in Amsterdam.<br/>The studio is compact but it is very cleverly designed and you have everything you need.  <br/>The neighbourhood is very nice with lots of cafes, bakery and supermarket all within walking distance.<br/>It’s very conveniently located for the trams back to the centre.  <br/><br/>It was such a pleasure staying in this beautiful studio apartment and I will not hesitate to stay there again.<br/><br/>"
78893852,"Nice place, good people, be sure to close the windows cats on attack "
79089487,"Matthijs was a great host and I have loved staying with him in Amsterdam.  Very kind, great communication, and I felt very relaxed. Perfect stay!"
79154928,"From the several Airbnb places I stayed at during my Europe trip, Marielle's was by far the best. She's super attentive to anything you may need, the place is immaculate and I really love the Dutch style of the room and building. If I come to Amsterdam — I'll be staying there again :)"
79393007,"WARNING !!! DO NOT STAY HERE. <br/><br/>For everyone who is thinking of renting this place stay away. The host met us and told us that day for no reason that she would be away on November the 25th so do not contact her. Coincidently the night of the 25th we left the apartment and we had all our belongings stolen. $8000 was taken in items including passports which lead to us being stranded in Amsterdam with no money, no passports and our fight leaving the next day. She told us not to report  this on reviews and to not warn the people staying after us,  the whole situation was very suspicious and nothing was adding up...  I'm writing this so this doesn't happen to anyone else And amongst all this I'm wondering if this has ever happened to anyone else on Airbnb."
79512062,"We had a great stay. The neighborhood was perfect and very close to Vondelpark. It has wondeful café's and bars within a two minute walk, which was very convenient."
79644650,"Alex is a fantastic host, the apartment was exactly as described. 20 minutes into the town centre, easily done by tram. Very modern inside, very secure and felt extremely clean. Amazing wifi, fantastic tv and excellent kitchen. Will certainly recommend to friends and family. Thank you!!!! "
80009269,"Très bon accueil avec une hôtesse souriante (parle plusieurs langue ce qui facilite la communication). La chambre est simple et efficace avec plusieurs équipements qui sont très appréciables (cafetière, théière, frigo...) <br/>Maike nous a donné plusieurs conseils pour notre visite de la ville + des plans. Petit déj au top ! <br/>Le logement est proche des transports en commun, possibilité d'accéder au centre en une petite heure de marche, point de vu très beau.  <br/>Prix très correct. <br/>Rien à redire, à recommander."
80516910,"Matthijs,was great on all things. The only thing was one day he said we had left the bathroom dirty, I had , and have no idea, unless we weren't suppose to leave our wet towel hung up in the bathroom. We put them on the heating rack, but it might not have been the way they do things."
80521151,Kate was awesome. Very accommodating with letting us keep our bags there after checkout and the area was very central which was great.
80606502,Bettina is a wonderful and very helpful host. The room was lovely with a comfortable bed/bath and great location. We appreciated her recommendations and the bike rental. Great place to stay. Really appreciated the extra attention to detail and the list of gluten free restaurants in the area. Thank you!
80645526,"My boyfriend and I stayed in Viola & Daniel's apartment for our first holiday together and it couldn't have been more perfect!<br/>The apartment is even nicer than the pictures show, it has the most wonderful views over canals and is so bright and welcoming! I will be recommending their apartment to friends and would recommend a stay here if visiting Amsterdam. The location was perfect for our needs, it was within close walking distance of multiple lovely neighbourhoods and plenty of public transport, it was also very accessible to get to and from the very city centre! It was fantastic to have such a close 'base camp' so we could nip back during the afternoons/eat dinner at home before heading back out to see more of the city without losing too much of the day, it also is such a homely place you find yourself wanting to go back!<br/>Thank you to Viola & Daniel for letting us stay, it really made the holiday so much better! "
80864148,"We had a good stay here, just good. The beds and our room was comfortable, but the house smelled like smoke for the two days we were there. For me I am a non smoker and it gave me a headache most of the time had to spray our room with air freshener once or twice. The location however was great it's near the train station and two tram stops which gave us easy access to the city. The host herself is very nice and gave us a great stay. "
80962270,"My sister and I had the best time in Amsterdam. Stephanie's and Sebastian's wonderful apartment made our stay even more special. We felt very comfortable in their place with many stylish details. The apartment is perfectly located as well. You can walk, rent a bike or take the tram to get into the city center. We loved the fact to have a tram station right across the street. <br/>A young, international and super nice couple with lots of insider tips for you:) we loved it and hope the apartment is available the next time we come and visit Amsterdam! "
81029689,"Amazing host, beautiful place, very clean and big. So welcoming. Very practical location to go anywhere in the city and very close to a bog parking where we left our car for 1€\day. We would definitely come back."
81260416,"Nada possède un magnifique appartement confortable, propre, moderne et très bien meublé. Le logement situé au dernier étage possède une terrasse sur le toit, top pour passer un bon moment. Il est également situé proche du tram (accès musée) et du métro (4 arrêts de la gare et du centre ville). Enfin, nous avons très bien été accueilli par une amie de Nada à notre arrivée et par Nada à notre départ qui nous a également autorisé à laisser nos bagages chez elle pour profiter de notre dernier jour.

81298594,"Toetsie goes above and beyond what is required as a host and made our first time using AirBnB a delight. She even provided essentials including food, drink and toiletries which we were more than happy to take advantage of. We would be more than happy to return!<br/>Thank you, Toetsie!"

All the comforts of home! The neighborhood was charming, quiet, and convenient to many sights. Highly recommend. "

82107281,Ellen hat professionell den Kontakt geführt und war überaus angenehm und hilfreich! Sie hat Unterlagen mit Tipps und Ratschlägen zusammengestellt und sich als hervorragende Gastgeberin erwiesen! Es gibt in kleinster Weide absolut irgendetwas zu beanstanden! Uneingeschränkte Empfehlung!
82298009,"Le contact avec notre hôte était très facile, car il parle anglais. Les délais de réponses étaient convenables, il m'a tout bien expliqué et une fois arrivé sur place, l'appartement était bien comme sur les photos, très joli et spacieux. Nous n'avons pas eu de réels problèmes à vivre dans cet appartement moderne. Le quartier n'est pas un des plus beaux d'Amsterdam, mais il est à proximité de beaucoup de commerces, ainsi que des transports afin de se rendre à la gare centrale, là où démarre toutes les activités essentielles de la ville.

82320460,It was great! Vibeke was an awesome help. She mapped out where all of the places we wanted to go and more. Very welcoming and I recommend her place! Thanks Vibeke!!
82455304,"Such a great stay at Colm's place! The room was so nice, clean, and comfortable, it was very easy to get a good nights sleep. The service was also amazing, Colm prepared us a big breakfast every morning that was very tasty and original each time, he also prepared us a great supper one night because he knew we were on a budget, even had some nice wine with it! Also very convenient to reach from the city center. Colm was also very helpful with things to do in the city and is very knowledgeable of the Amsterdam. If I'm ever back in Amsterdam I will definitely be looking for this spot again, perfect Airbnb experience! I"
82520486,Excelente lugar. Muy recomendable.
82533430,"This was a great apartment and Laura and Arjan's service and communication were exemplary.  For a solo traveler, this was great, as they made me feel right at home.  Arjan pleasantly met me at the airport when I arrived and gave me a ride.  Laura did the same when I was leaving which was very convenient and saved some money on transportation.  Each morning they provided a nice breakfast with fruit, cheese, croissants, juice, and coffee.  <br/>The apartment is a bit far from the city center, but definitely walkable to most parts.  It was nice being outside of touristy parts of Amsterdam, and the view right outside the apartment was aesthetically pleasing.  <br/>Overall I would highly recommend Laura and Arjan's place to anyone visiting Amsterdam."
82632429,"Das Haus und die Lage ist ein Traum! Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt! Es war ruhig, die Einrichtung sehr edel, die Betten super gemütlich, fußläufig erreicht man Frühstückcafés, Restaurants und alles was das Herz begehrt!

82826636,Lora is quite friendly. The place is very convenient to go everywhere. Well..a better bed would be more appreciated for the travlers.
82895315,"Gina and Frans, <br/>Thank You for the warm welcome. With all the sweet gifts ;) <br/>The stay at your house was really great! We felt home away from home.<br/>The surroundings are quiet and getting everywhere is easy by foot or tram. <br/>As we enjoy Amsterdam so much, we'll be going to see each other again for sure. <br/>Best regards,<br/>Pedro and Sara. <br/>"
82942958,"Marga and Rico are really nice. They came to the station to pick me up and help me with a lot about my lost luggage. I really appreciate it. The house is exactly as the picture showed, clean, warm and cozy. The map and the travel guidance are also helpful. Rico recommended me good places to visit on his way to work and drops me in a very convenient location. The decorations inside and outside are pretty. This is my first time to see a real boat house. That is a lovely and warm design. Thank you very much, Marga and Rico. Thank you for everything. I definitely recommend it and perhaps I will go with my friends again next time. "
83112464,"Laura, Arjan, and Chery were amazing hosts! They made our stay in Amsterdam easy and fun. They gave us food recommendations, let us borrow their bikes and so much more. They truly aim to surpass your expectations, and do so in many ways. Thank you! "
83117870,Kate was great. She was very responsive during the booking process and helped us find our way around after we arrived. The location is central. The room is as advertised and we were comfortable and satisfied.
83301489,Pim's place was very clean and organized. He left breakfast for us in the fridge. We felt like home. 
83446939,"The stay at Caroline's place was beyond words! The apartment is super spacious, yet very gezellig (a word that exists only in Dutch and Danish and is similar to, but not exactly cozy). The location us just perfect only a short few minutes' walk from the very center of Amsterdam and in probably the most beautiful and charming part of the city right at the edge / beginning of the Jordaan. Caroline was fast and courteous in her replies to us, we had absolutely no hazzle or worries. Wieke is a very nice person with great knowledge of local gems and made us feel at home at once. <br/>A stay at Caroline's comes with our warmest of recommendations!"
83503592,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay - for four days we felt like we actually lived in Amsterdam. Apartment was perfectly located, had all the amenities we needed, great views, very clean and modern. I would highly recommend staying there to others. Gabriel went out of his way to ensure all was to our extreme satisfaction! Even found a place to store our bags until we could have the keys to the apartment.  "
83893402,"The accomodation and location was perfect and her house is such a warm, cosy and friendly place ; with two cats so lovely :-) Toetsie was a wonderful and welcoming host. It was a pleasure to meet her and staying there. I really recommend her and want to come back one day :-) Thanks a lot Toetsie !"

Clean and decorated to high standards and Petra was really helpful. <br/>Lovely quite neighbourhood with some of the best restaurants in town (Ron Gastrobar, Pizza and Prosecco, Foundue place..) and well located (A couple of tram stops from Leidseplein) Also schipol airport only a short way in tram."
84064119,"Vooraf was er een duidelijke, en snelle communicatie, ok bijv betreft het parkeren wat goed te doen is voor de deur.<br/>Vladimir is heel toegankelijk, makkelijk in de omgang en bereid al je vragen te beantwoorden over wat je wilt doen in Amsterdam. De metro en tram zijn heel dichtbij, zo ben je snel in het centrum.<br/><br/>De kamer is netjes, in een rustige buurt, gebruik van toilet en douche was ook netjes."
84207171,"Casa muy acojedora que hace que te sientas como un habitante más de la ciudad. A nosotros nos ha encantado esta casa porque puedes ver cómo es una vivienda de holanda por dentro y cómo viven los holandeses.  Tiene un montón de detalles y particularmente nos encantó el sofá porque era muy ancho y cómodo! El apartamento tiene  de todo y más y además hay una pequeña terracita en la que desayunábamos cada mañana. Para mi, el apartamento ideal si no fuera porque no había microondas... y eso es algo bastante esencial si quieres calentarte la leche cada mañana o calentar la mayoría de comidas preparadas que venden en el supermercado.<br/>Si tengo que decir algo no tan bueno es que el anuncio ponía que había lavadora y cuando llegamos ahí no había, cosa que nos chafó un poco porque llevábamos varios días de viaje en París y ya contábamos con lavar nuestra ropa sucia en Amsterdam.<br/><br/>Por lo demás todo genial!<br/><br/>"
84262592,"Mirjam was an awesome host! She communicated very well regarding our stay and was very meticulous about directions to her place. This location is walking distance from the Centraal Station, Anne Frank house, museums, and all the tourist spots. On the day of checking in, my wife and I got lost. We sent her a message. She immediately said she'll come to us and she did. She went above and beyond. She walked us up to our room and gave us a map and told us where the good spots are. Our bed was so comfy. She also provided a robe, towels, slippers, blow dryer, adapter, shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, and the best thing ever.... Chocolates! There's also a mini fridge too. <br/>Mirjam, thank you for your kind hospitality. We'll be back. :)"
84327172,"Se dovessi sintetizzare, direi ""They were wonderful, I have nothing to add"". Laura and Arjan si sono dimostrati attenti e amichevoli, sempre disponibili a fornirci consigli o mettersi a disposizione per rendere il nostro breve soggiorno ad Amsterdam piacevole. <br/>L'appartamento è in comoda posizione rispetto al centro e facilmente raggiungibile, oltre che essere ben curato nell'arredamento e comfortevole. <br/>È stato un piacere essere accolti come se fossimo a casa, anche se purtroppo solo per un breve periodo di tempo. Decisamente un'appartamento da consigliare se si è in vacanza ad Amsterdam.<br/>Keep up the good work! Thanks again!"
84897746,Directions from the station were easy to follow. Room is excellent with very good attention to detail and one of the best locations in Amsterdam centre. Would not hesitate in recommending this room to anyone wanting to stay in the city.
84968449,Rosie was a great host. She was very welcoming and made everything very easy. Definitely would reccomend staying with her. The room was very nice and quite comfortable. 
85039902,"Marielle's place was beautiful and although she was away she ensured my arrival was smooth. The stairs, as described were exceptionally steep, especially with luggage regardless of my light packing - thankfully her assistant helped me carry my bag downstairs upon departure. The wifi in the room didn't seem to be working very well and the room across the hall was very loud; coming home loudly late at night and playing music at early hours which disturbed my sleep. However, the overall room was tidy and I had a pleasant stay. Thank you for your flexibility."
85057494,Nice vacay. Thank You.<br/>
85119909,La estancia en casa de Marga no podría haber sido mejor. La casa y el entorno son muy acogedores y tranquilos. Tanto Marga cómo su familia son geniales y te hacen sentir como en casa. Muy recomendable.
85369639,It was fantastic to stay there ! Great city vibes in one of the best private rooms of the center
85416192,"Ubytování se nám líbílo, je v dobré části Amstedamu. Čistý slunný byt se záhrádkou kde se dá dobře grilovat. Hostitel komunikoval po celou dobu pobytu a z ubytování máme dobrý pocit. V případě, že budeme opakovat pobyt v Amsterdamu opět využijeme. V bytě vše čisté, udržované."
85432454,"Kate is friendly and very prompt with her responses. She was very flexible with check out time which was very convenient.<br/>She mentioned that the previous guests had just left so she just started cleaning once we got there. After she was done cleaning, the bathroom toilet was still dirty. But she cleaned it right away once we addressed it with her and was very apologetic. The kitchen smelt bad with dirty dishes in the sink but that didn't affect us that much since we didn't need to use it. Also, she doesn't allow any kind of animal products in the fridge. We had left overs from dinner but ended up eating it the same night since we found out we couldn't put it in the fridge. Only good if you're vegan or have allergies."
85480786,"We had a great time at Jelle's apartment. The 2 double beds and sofa was very comfortable. We tended to walk into the city, which took about 20 mins, and get Uber home in the evenings for 8 euros. The neighborhood is nice and quiet, with plenty of local amenities, and close to the city center. We booked last minute but Jelle responded almost instantly to our booking request, and also allowed our early check in. Overall, I would definitely stay in Jelle's place again."
85637964,"The studio is perfect for a short staying to visit Amsterdam and the surroundings. It is located in a neat residential area from which you can easily reach every place by tram, bus or even bicycle! The studio is bright and very comfortable, and it is bigger than it looks on the pics in the website. Plus, Stephanie and Sebastian are very warm and welcoming people, always willing to help with everything you need during your staying and to recommend nice events and restaurants in the city. I definitely recommend their Park Suite, you won't regret it! "
85679306,Excellent accommodations. Clean and comfortable. Beautiful room with fresh flowers. Easy access to the city center by tram. Host was responsive to all questions and requests. She went out of her way to make us feel welcome. Highly recommend. 
85684174,"Super séjour à Amsterdam ! John et Gabriella ont été adorables, prévenants, enthousiastes de recevoir. La chambre était très confortable, tout est fait pour se sentir bien. L'appartement est très lumineux et calme Le petit déjeuner au top. Merci pour ces belles journées passées à Amsterdam."
85812417,"My trip to Amsterdam was the first time me and my boyfriend had been abroad together. I, in particular wanted everything to be perfect and accommodation was a huge part of that. I had never used Airbnb before but we decided to give it ago because it's much cheaper than hotels. We saw Matthijs place, which had excellent reviews and went for it. I'm so glad we did. The location is perfect, it's easy to pop back to as and  needed. As a host Matthijs was brilliant he was welcoming and provided us we lost of information. We had no clue what would be provided but he'd thought of it all towels, dressing gowns, hair dryer, kettle etc! The room we stayed in does look smaller than the picture but there was plenty of space for us and our luggage. And the size just made it more cosy and romantic. The bakery breakfast was fantastic! I'll not go into too much detail but, it was not what we expected. I would 100% recommended staying here and we most certainly will again!!!"
85877187,Very friendly host with a charming Appartement in the perfect  area.
86060279,"Een mooie rustige plek, vriendelijke ontvangst, wat wel een dingetje is dat je zelf voor ontbijt mag zorgen en dan is t ongeveer 10min lopen naar een supermarkt."
86297861,"Ton and Will have a beautiful apartment and have gone to exceptional lengths to make their guests feel at home. They provided foolproof directions (including photos) to get us there, and welcomed us on our arrival. They live in a fairly quiet neighbourhood, just five minutes walk from the train/tram stop, and from there it takes just 15 - 20 minutes to reach the city centre. <br/><br/>The room itself is lovely, and both it and the bathroom would put many hotels to shame. The continental breakfast was delicious and plentiful, and on the Sunday morning Ton also cooked us one of the best omelettes I've ever tasted. It's hard to believe they've been doing Airbnb for a relatively short time, as they've covered all the bases and have a natural flair for it. I cannot recommend them too highly. A million thanks, guys!"
86370217,"I strongly recommend Vibeke's apartment for stay in Amsterdam. It is really cozy, with good connection to the city center. Vibeke is so nice and helpful. I had a good contact with her before the arrival, she always fully and quickly responds to all questions."
86467009,"The property is in a very nice residential neighborhood, quiet and pleasant yet close to a great organic supermarket and public transportation. <br/>Toetsie was very kind, accommodating and communicative, helping out with all my needs and questions.<br/>The room itself is just as described in the pictures and is very cozy and quiet.<br/>I was there for a week, and it felt like home!"
86828988,"Alle Erwartungen übertroffen ! Wir haben uns kurzfristig dazu entschlossen fürs Wochenende nach Amsterdam zu reisen, und nur einen Tag vorher bei Airbnb gebucht. Wir hatten wirklich keine hohen Ansprüche so kurzfristig noch etwas besonderes zu finden, doch mit dem Zimmer bei Dennie waren wir total beeindruckt. Die Lage war perfekt, sehr zentral und trotzdem ruhig, viele nette Restaurants und Cafe's in der Nachbarschaft und man hat das Gefühl mitten drin zu sein. Die Anreise hat reibungslos geklappt, auch dank der guten Beschreibung von Dennie und Elske. Zum Zimmer kann man nichts sagen außer, dass es wunder wunder wunderschön war ! Alles sehr gepflegt und jedes Detail ist mit Liebe gestaltet. Dennie und Elske haben uns sehr herzlich empfangen, uns bei allem Hilfe angeboten und wir hatten wirklich das Gefühl willkommen zu sein ! Sie haben uns viele Tipps gegeben, und dank Ihnen konnten wir so manche Schlange vor einer Sehenswürdigkeit weglassen :) ! Wirklich ein gelungenes Wochenende, und wir würden nicht zögern es genauso wieder zu tun :) !"
87017728,"Alex is kind and very responsive. And a fantastic host, considering the surprise for his guests. The apartment is very clean, vibrant and full of life. Equipped with everything you'd need and beyond. Very close to tram and metro stations, it's close enough to the city center, giving you though the quietness of a residential area. A great stay, definitely to come back to! "
87058818,"Our stay was excellent! This was our first visit to Amsterdam and our first Airbnb experience. The photographs and descriptions included in the listing are 100% accurate and Maike and Caspar are incredibly kind and helpful. We especially enjoyed the breakfast and the opportunity to stay slightly outside of the city center with easy access to things we needed. <br/>If you do not choose to eat lunch or dinner out, we had good luck purchasing small fresh meals and snacks at the local grocery store Jumbo in the nearby shopping center. Maike provided dishes and utensils along with a microwave and refrigerator inside the room. She also offers many guidebooks and personal suggestions for dining and entertainment. <br/>Thank you Maike and Caspar! I wish we could have stayed longer!  "
87142970,"Gabriella and John are very kind and friendry. I could enjoy this staying and feel confortable. And, their house have many interesting and cool Asian goods!<br/>日本人の方には特におすすめします。彼らはとても親切で、日本の文化に理解があります。もてなしは僕が利用したAirbnbの中でも最高レベルでした。 Simon & Luth 's apartment is very comfotable and quiet. I could walk to museums. but I recommend to ride a bicycle because it is faster and fun!"
87237050,"The guesthouse is great to live in. It feel like a hobbit house, cosy, warm and very relaxing. There were some little additions that show how thoughtful the host is: a travel adaptor, little chocolate, wide range of teas.  There is a also a private piano in the room, which makes it quite special. I am very happy with the experience and would definitely recommend it."
87306054,Es war ein wunderbares Wochenende in Amsterdam.  Es hat alles gestimmt. Wir wurden sehr herzlich von Matthijs empfangen. Er hatte viele interessante Infos und Tips für uns. Die Lage des Zimmers ist perfekt. Viele Sehenswürdigkeiten sind fussläufig zu erreichen. Das Frühstück haben wir in gemütlicher Atmosphäre genießen können.  Wir würden sagen: Alles perfekt!
87350902,"The house is great, spacious and clean. The description is absolutely correct, the neighborhood is nice and it takes around 20 mins to the city centre. Enith and his son Evan are very welcoming, they also gave us a map of the city and a description how to get to their house, it's very easy. I recommend the stay here."
87458928,Very nice place in a really good area and<br/>Ro was very nice to us.<br/>And from here i want to thank you again. . . you are the mannnnn..
87990146,"Lovely place, felt in the heart of artistic Amsterdam and great too for our 18 month old. Felt very welocme, although we did not meet Rini - maybe next time."
87999392,"Julie ,  her apparement and cats were very nice ! The apartment was very clean and right next to the center of Amsterdam !

88070840,"Very organized , clean and orientation. Watch out its the 3rd floor and not very close to the center. Other than this all was great "
88167156,"L'accueil de Joke a été en tout point conforme à l'annonce et aux commentaires élogieux qui l'accompagnaient. Ses qualités humaines (et culinaires) rendent son hospitalité bien amicale, ses efforts pour aplanir les difficultés de langue donnent envie de poursuivre le voyage en sa compagnie."
88525750,"Quartier très agréable, logement en tout point conforme aux photos, literie et petit déjeuner excellent. <br/>Hôtes charmants et très sympathiques, très attentifs au confort de leurs voyageurs.<br/>Bref une très bonne adresse pour séjourner et visiter Amsterdam."
88698943,이숙소를 추천합니다.  <br/>위치고 매우 좋고 미술관 다니기에 아주 좋습니다.<br/>방은 사진보다 더 아름답고 깨끗합니다.  <br/>petra는 매우 친절하고 빠른답변을 줘서 아주 좋았습니다.  <br/>제가 영어를 못해서 문제가 많았는데 많이 도와주려 애썼습니다.  매우 감사합니다.
88733644,"Amazing room, looks exactly like the pictures and it's in an amazing location. Would definitely be visiting again soon!"
88854476,"We really had a great stay in Amsterdam with Nima's room. The kitchen and the bathroom is quite big and for sleeping the bedroom has enough space.<br/>Nima was the best host we've ever had. He always answered in a minimum of time! The transport to Amsterdam Centraal Station is rly good. Like the others said, just walk 10min and you can use the free ferry which ships you directly in the centrum.<br/>All in all we would always travel to Amsterdam again whilst living in Nima's room!"
88942509,"Berith is a lovely host - friendly and great with communication. <br/>The house was welcoming, clean and comfortable. <br/>I'd be more than happy to stay here again or recommend Berith place to friends."
89060639,"Der Aufenthalt bei Marga und ihrer Familie war zwar nur eine Nacht, aber dafür sehr eindrucksvoll! Das kleine Gartenhäuschen ist ein Juwel sondersgleichen. Habe äußerst gut geschlafen und mich wie zu Hause gefühlt. Absolut empfehlenswert! Wenn ich wieder nach Amsterdam komme, schlafe ich definitiv dort."
89196518,"Nada's apartment is an absolute gem! It is located just a few minutes away from  Centraal Station through the subway and is also within walking distance from all the vibrant parts of Amsterdam. The building was renovated in 2015 and the flat has been designed with a lot of taste, making you kind of regret you would spend so much time visiting and not enjoying the apartment, especially its stunning rooftop! It is also fully equipped and you feel like home from the very first steps in the living room! This is also made possible by the warm welcome ensured by Nada who is a thoughtful and very responsive host. I would highly recommend the flat to any couple visiting Amsterdam and hope to be back in the future!"
89516661,"Marijke was a great host and I had a great time in her appartment. <br/>She was very friendly and helpful. The room was exactly as described. <br/>In short, a great stay. <br/>Thank you Marijke! "

90033713,10/10. Lovely houseboat and great location!
90077198,Nice place to stay that is clean and a good location.  Mattijs is super helpful and accomodating.  All in all great value.<br/>You may get some serious noise from the street (drunk party goers etc.) But that is what you deal with in amsterdam so central.  In our case it was construction equipment being moved at 6 am.
90255770,"Alloggio accogliente, vibeka è molto disponibile. La camera è spaziosa per due persone e rispetta la descrizione delle foto. Posizione ottima per raggiungere il centro , bus e tram a 5min a piedi. "

90377978,Daans apartment is smal but really comfortable. We did sleep well the whole time and feel welcomed in his home. We was able to cook and wash our clothes. U have to take the train to get to the city but it's also possible to walk in hour u are there. So every time again :)
90410723,"This quaint little cottage was way cuter than the pictures could ever do justice and it was the prefect little hideaway on the canals of Amsterdam,  wish I had more than one night here.  Marga and Rico were super friendly and did everything in their power to make my stay pleasant.  "

90490173,"Minä ja 3 kaveriani vietettiin pitkä viikonloppu Amsterdamissa.<br/>Asunto oli juuri sitä mitä kuvissa oli ja kaikki toimi loistavasti.<br/>Isäntämme Mark oli paikalla vastaan ottamassa meidät kun saavuimmme.<br/>Hän oli myös hyvin saatavilla ennen matkaa kun halusimme jotain tietoja kysellä.Asunto oli siistissä kunnossa ja kaikki tarpellinen asunnossa saatavilla.<br/>Aamupalat kokkasimme asunnossa mutta alueella on lukuisia paikkoja jossa<br/>voi sen myös tehdä.<br/>Alueella muutenkin on hyvin illanviettopaikko ja muuta elämää.<br/>Iso kauppa on heti tien päässä noin 200 m.<br/>voin todellakin suositellla paikkaa ja Isäntäämme Markkia.<br/>Kiitos vielä Mark sinulle viimeisestä."
90502990,"This was our first time using Air BnB and my boyfriend and I had such a wonderful time staying with Nabila and her family. She welcomed us in the kindest of ways and was extremely helpful with helping us settle in, explaining how everything worked and the best ways to travel around Amsterdam and even gave us some great restaurant recommendations. On our first day of arrival she kindly gave us a lift to the nearby supermarket and showed us the area. Nabila has a lovely spirit and nice friendly nature. The location is perfect, it's a beautiful quiet neighbourhood, about 20 minutes from the city centre by tram, which is very convenient. <br/>The studio is spacious, extremely clean, modern and accommodating, with a very comfortable bed. It has all the amenities you could need and a private downstairs entrance. The garden is stunning, overlooking the canal and was the perfect setting for our breakfast every morning. Nabila has a wonderful Nespresso coffee machine that we took advantage of :)<br/>There is a bike shop nearby, so we rented bicycles which was a brilliant way to travel, we cycled to some beautiful parks nearby.<br/>Nabila even allowed us to use her BBQ on our last evening, which was really wonderful. Her husband kindly picked some tomatoes grown in their garden for us to have with our meal.<br/>As our flight home was late in the evening she allowed us to leave our luggage at the house after check out time and even gave us a lift to the tram stop with our suitcases :) <br/>We would highly recommend and definitely stay here again. Thank you Nabila for such amazing hospitality, we had a really lovely experience."
90503661,"when i emailed marc he said we could take our time checking in when in actual fact he emailed us that day saying we had to be there by a certain time, so time wise we were under pressure to get there as the directions given were not great and we had to search for the place, asking many locals for help. He also offered us a breakfast the next day, but we had to work around their schedule so we ended up having a later breakfast than anticipated and we didnt really enjoy it. i thought the breakfast was included only to find out when we were checking out that it cost 9 euro each, and we had basically only eaten bread. The place is located 20 minutes outside amsterdam which is annoying trying to get back at night, it cost 30 euro for a taxi to drop us back.  We also felt like ellen was disapproving of us because we came home one night at 11 and i felt like she didnt really want young people staying there. Although it says there is a private bathroom its a bit down the corridor and right beside their office, also there is this weird window between the bedroom and the bathroom which is quite uncomfortable because if somebody is in the bedroom they can see the other person on the toilet or in the shower. There was a coffee machine in the room but we couldnt operate it. we had looked for twin beds but instead we  got a double. I dont think i would stay here again, it wasnt necessarily cheaper than places in the city in fact with the breakfast included it was probably more expensive  and it is harder to access, also they are quite strict and we didnt really feel comfortable there."

Daher haben wir nur das kleine Schlafzimmer genutzt, dafür sind 304€ für 2 Nächte und 3 Personen ein stolzer Preis. Die zentrale Lage hat das aber auch etwas wettgemacht. Bad und Küche könnten sauberer sein. Insgesamt aber weiterzuempfehlen. "
90875085,"i stayed over the weekend at the 1 person room & had a first hand experience of local Dutch living in a traditional walk-up 5 storey terrace. The 2 cats in Toetsie's house, Roky & Peppi, added an extra spark to my stay. Thanks Toetsie!"
90973596,"very nice room, clean and cosy, the location makes it even better, david is awesome very approachable and friendly. "
91035304,"I loved staying there. Marga come to airport to pick me up and welcomed me. What a coincidence that we both are into Art of Living and meditation. Richo was also very responsive and helpful and because I was jet lagged and was lazy to get out of house, he prepared dinner for me which was so sweet.<br/><br/>Any person who is looking to stay in a cozy and beautiful guest house away from hustle bustle of Central par, go for it. Also, Amsterdam Centraal is also not very far from there.<br/><br/>Marga also prepared breakfast for me and it was very delicious.<br/><br/>Thanks Marga and family for a wonderful experience in Amsterdam.<br/><br/>Atul"
91084457,David was very helpful throughout our stay and provided perfect directions which made it very easy to find. The room was spacious and clean on arrival and David made us feel extremely welcome. Hugely recommended and location is amazing! 
91194617,"Nima's house is very nice at a good location. Didn't get to meet him but he made sure the place was clean and provided me with things that'd help me with my stay (map, wifi, etc). Fifteen minute walk to the free ferry ride that'll take you to the central station/city area. Definitely would recommend staying at his home"
91198614,"Pim is very welcoming and helpful. His home is fun, warm, spacious and cozy. Everything was there ready for us. Kitchen is amazing. It was raining so we weren't able to use the rooftop, otherwise it would have been out hangout place. <br/><br/>One only downside is bathroom/ WC water pressure is slow. "
91365595,Really awesome cozy place with great location. But Pim is the best airBnB host I have ever had the pleasure of renting from. I consider him a friend now
91407148,"The apartment is just as adorable as it looks in the photos--bright and airy and modern yet charming and old at the same time.  It is decorated perfectly and even has a brand new kitchen area recently installed.  The large beautiful front widows look out on a community park, and a neighborhood school.  It was delightful to look out and see and hear children playing at recess, especially since we were missing our own children!  The big tree out front is beautiful, and pay attention in the morning as there are gorgeous green parrots that hop all about on it--apparently a few escaped from the zoo a few years ago and now a population has taken home around Amsterdam!  <br/><br/>The location is great and walkable almost anywhere, or the tram stops right around the corner.  Great grocery store right downstairs.  Fun street right around the corner with great shopping and food.  Short walk up a canal and you are to the city center.  <br/><br/>Checkin was simple and easy with the service they use, and flexible timing.  Best of all Ellie and her husband Bertram are just simply delightful.  Wonderfully helpful, friendly and kind people.   <br/><br/>"
91501928,"Great location, just 5 minutes from Central Station and 10 minutes from the red light area. The room is exactly as pictured and the bed is very comfy, we certainly would love to stay again if you would have us back."
91585578,"We fell in love with this location in the wonderful De Pijp neighborhood located less than a 10 minute walk from the Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh Museum, and the famous IAMSTERDAM sign. <br/><br/>This location offered staying in a neighborhood full of wonderful local shops, markets, bars, and amazing restaurants like Van 't Spit (the chicken there is to die for)<br/><br/>The apartment itself was perfect for our stay in Amsterdam complete with a kitchen, separate bedroom, pull out couch if you needed it, and great WiFi.  Our host, Lizzy, was great and gave us some wonderful recommendations for dinner and drinks.  She also left us a bottle of wine (it was our Honeymoon) local snacks, and coupons to activities in the city.<br/><br/>The tram is about a 5 minute walk from the apartment so if walking it too much for you, the tram is a great way to get around the city.  <br/><br/>Thank you for making our stay in Amsterdam wonderful!  We will be back!"
91847111,"Petra is a lovely, kind empathetic and friendly host. The accommodation is immaculate and the decor suits both male and female guests.  I loved her attention to detail such as a little bottle of water and chocolate on each bedside table plus fresh flowers on the larger table. The bathroom shower was amazing.  Petra has installed a soft water system which added to the experience.  There is everything you need in the kitchen should you decide eat in.<br/><br/>If you are visiting Amsterdam, I highly recommend that you stay with Petra.  I have already recommended Petra's place to friends and colleagues.  "
92068606,"Nice place, and very kind. I wonder to come back. "
92098038,"I stayed at Mark's Place with my 3 friends. The area is very nice with its restaurants and bars. The Tram to the city is close but u could also walk to the centre (20min). <br/>The most time in the apt we hung out in the kitchen. Big place, very bright, beautiful big windows. <br/>The beds were perfect. <br/>A place I would love to call my home! "
92106151,"Тихий зелёный район. Можно либо прогуляться и переплыть в центр на бесплатном пароме (на береге Noord есть два места, откуда отходят паромы в сторону центра), либо воспользоваться автобусом № 34, остановка которого очень близка к месту проживания.<br/>Jeroen очень вежлив, доброжелателен, всегда готов помочь/подсказать, но при этом ненавязчив.<br/>У Jeroen можно арендовать два велосипеда, правда, воспользоваться ими мы сами не успели. Возможно получится в следующий раз.<br/>Отличный вариант по соотношению цена/качество."
92132215,"Appartement agréable situé dans un quartier résidentiel très calme. <br/>Nous avons séjourné chez Martine durant une semaine à l'occasion d'un salon qui se tenait au RAI situé à quelques stations de tram sur la ligne 12.<br/>Nous avons beaucoup apprécié le confort et la tranquillité de l'appartement de Martine après nos journées de travail.<br/>Martine a été charmante et aux petits soins avec nous, périodiquement en contact par SMS afin de s'assurer que tout se passait bien, qu'il ne nous<br/>manquait rien et que notre séjour se déroulait bien. <br/>Merci Martine pour votre sympathique accueil, nous mettons dés à présent une option pour notre prochain IBC ;-)<br/> Comme chaque année nous avons revenons avec grand plaisir chez Martine."
92132699,"Peter was really kind and gaves un a wonderful welcome with coffee,  biscuit and cake. The apartament was beautiful and cozy, and a very important thing is that is near the centre. <br/>I'll be happy to come back soon! "
92147468,I really loved this room right in the middle of Amsterdam. It allowed me so much freedom to be able to come and go and make it my base of operations while I was in the city.  The room was certainly very clean and tidy and nicely decorated.  The most wonderful thing about the room is the window which gives a great view to the alley and once the windows are shut there is not much noise.  This was my first time using Airbnb and after this experience I will surely use it agai.
92228326,"Corina is very kind and helpful. The location of the room is perfect. Right in the heart of Jordaan and next to a big supermarket, surrounded by nice little shops and restaurants. "
92420424,"What an introduction to Amsterdam! Thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this extremely well appointed houseboat in a perfect location, close to everything you would want to see.. Brilliant self catering options with an awesome cooks kitchen. Cosy and comfy lounge and sleeping area with a fantastic modern bathroom.. Lovely shower !! :) Very much enjoyed sipping champers on the deck watching the boats pass by. Thank you Patricia, you are a lovely host, super helpful and very obliging. We could not have hoped for a better experience. We shall be back!! "
92517541,Joke is a very nice host. We felt very comfortable. I would recommend it to anyone. She met our every wish. Everything was clean and the breakfast was delicious. Thank you Joke!! 5 Stars*****
92803881,The house is exactly as described. 3mins walk to tram station. Sebastian and Stephanie are ultimately friendly. Everything about the house is very good. 
92836909,"We had a great experience staying at Fenno's. Apartment is in a nice neighbourhood which is within a walkable distance to the city centre. Alternatively, there is a bus which picks you up round the corner or you could hire a bicycle and be there in ten minutes. <br/>Apartment was clean, tidy and as described. Fenno went out of his way to help us with ideas to fill our weekend and was contactable as needed during our stay.<br/>We highly recommend Fenno as a host and would stay in his apartment again definitely. "
92891097,"Nice and helpful host but not so much clean and not so much close as described in profile. Walking to central station takes 15-20 min, 40-50 min to van Gogh museum, 20-25 min to RLD. But still it is walkable. At my experience, Liina was my host and Gina was in a trip. Liiina was so nice , kind and helpful, but i think she made a mistake in my room choosing! I chased sunny room but the cheeper cosy room was prepared for me! I asked her is the same of my chased room, she said yes! But now that i have time to check the rooms pictures and specification, it was not the same! I hope it was just a mistake. The toilet and bathroom was well in access but not so much clean for sensitive peoples, but it was ok for me for 1 night. Next time i dont use this service, because there was a limited time that i could put my luggage there after my settlement and forced me back soon to pick up my luggage and going to airport so much earlier that i was planned. "
92987665,"""Great apartment, looks exactly like the pictures, spacious and tidied, we had a great stay there and Jerry, the owner, was very nice and welcoming. We definitely recommend it !"""
93170776,"When we arrived at the apartment we were met with a warm and friendly welcome by Roland.  He showed us the apartment and answered any questions that we had. <br/>In the apartment there was a vase of lovely White roses on the table and also a small bottle of wine which was a very nice and personal touch.<br/>There is book full of information about the local amenities and lots of helpful leaflets for the attractions and sight seeing and bus and tram time tables that we used a lot.<br/>The location of the apartment was perfect for us as it was close enough to the town that you could easily walk it but far enough away  that you could escape the hustle and bustle and just enough the waterside location.  There are tram and bus stops very close by  as well. <br/> Nearby there are two supermarkets and an amazing bakery/cafe that we visited most days!!<br/>All in all a lovely apartment in a lovely location with super hosts.<br/>We enjoyed our stay immensely.<br/><br/><br/>"
93191285,Sehr schönes Apartment in Amsterdam. Es ist circa 20 min. Vom Zentrum entfernt aber sehr leicht zu erreichen. Die Gastgeber Gabrielle und Jon sind wirklich nett und hilfsbereit. Ist nur weiter zu empfehlen :) 
93648064,"It feels like home at Toetsie's place. Everything has been thought of and ""the living is easy"". The regular visits of the two cats add to the cosiness of the apartment. I'd like to come back! "
93734435,"This was our first Airbnb experience and it was a lot of fun. The property was awesome and the location was perfect. <br/>We did have one issue with checkout but it wasn't the hosts fault but the company that manages it for them. We waited for 30 minutes after our scheduled checkout time and when they still didn't show, we had to leave to catch our train. Don't let that persuade your decision on this beautiful home though, it's a great place!"
93912328,"Peter es muy amable, correcto y muy confiado, ha entregado las llaves y siempre estuvo de muy buen humor, esta poco tiempo en la casa por su trabajo. Todo lo publicado es tal cual y la casa esta impecable, limpia y ordenada. Muy recomendable."

94790448,"Sehr sehr nette gastgeber. <br/>Man fühlt sich sehr willkommen. <br/>Die umgebung ist natürlich super schön. Das kleine gasthaus ist mehr als gemütlich und die direkte nähe zur amstel tut das übrige. "
95263166,"Erik as a host is very much concerned about the wellbeing of his guests and I can really recommend to stay with him. He took time to explain the modus operandi of his house to us, provided tea, coffee and cookies for us, showed us where to find extra blankets and gave us hints where to go for shopping and leisure in Amsterdam. He also inspired us with stories and experiences from his life and showed us his artworks. Thank you, Erik!"
95414093,"Gina is a very nice person, she can speak 5 languages and a part time musician, she lend me her bicycle to explore the city and we made Chinese no version of her new track which made us laugh all the time..."
95505795,"On our arrival Hans was welcoming and friendly and was talking to us about the area. He suggested some great spots and circled them on a map for us - very helpful :). The room is private and it was clean and spacious, whilst also managing to be cosy and homely. There was fresh fruit and snacks on the table, and they provide towels, cutlery, coffee & tea facilities and a hairdryer! Although the room is on a bustling street, once you close the door and climb all the stairs up to your room, you wouldn't really know. Any noise when I'm trying to sleep bothers me, but I slept well! The room is only about a 10 minute walk from Dam Square, so fairly central! Besides, it's a nice walk :). If we go back to Amsterdam, we will definitely see if Wendie & Hans have a room free! Thanks both - Michaela & Steven :)."
95580671,"Neighbourhood was lovely and quiet for the majority of the time (7am start of some building work on the weekdays was a bit of a wake-up call but luckily we can sleep through a lot and our daughter was up around then anyway).<br/>Manon and the family were so helpful from the moment we booked to the moment we left, they couldn't have been any more helpful! :)<br/>Having a child friendly home was perfect for our daughter and she loved the bed! :)<br/>House was clean, tidy and perfect for our family trip away.<br/>Closest supermarket is about a mile away but quite a nice walk.<br/>Thank you for every bit of advice and the overall stay. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. :)"
95770693,"He was incredibly helpful and very willing to help, he made his home our home and was very informative and walked us through everything. He gave us tons of information for the city and how to handle everything that may cross paths with us"
95829180,"The appartment was cute, comfortable and clean. The location allowed us to enjoy the city and it was pretty close to the centre and the museums. There are good restaurats around. However, we had to wait over an hour to get into the appartment. The bed hid a secret, actually there were two beds joined by an extra mattress."
95870316,"Es war eine sehr schöne und total süß eingerichtete Wohnung. Die Gastgeber waren sehr freundlich und liebenswert. Die Zimmer, sowie das Bad waren sehr sauber. Die Unterkunft kann man auf alle Fälle weiterempfehlen. "
95901330,"Me and my boyfriend stayed at Marloes and Gabreils' place for a long weekend. I can't begin to explain how much we loved it. Such a safe and lovely area... only 20 minute tram ride to the centre. They even had bikes for us to take out.<br/> <br/>The apartment was lovely and clean, had everything we needed and the bed was AMAZING!!! Gabriel was very helpful and understanding. I would definitely recommend their place to anyone... starting with my family and friends. We will also be staying again if we get the opportunity. Thanks alot."
96134837,"Hemos estado genial. Judith nos ha dado muchísimas facilidades en todo momento, incluso llegamos tarde y nos esperó a nuestra llegada. La casa es magnífica y acogedora, la habitación bonita, perfecta y la cama genial. En el anuncio comenta que la ducha está en la habitación pero no nos ha molestado para nada, siempre se lo ha combinado para entrar cuando no estábamos. La zona es genial y a 5 minutos andando de un TRAM que te deja en la plaza principal de Amsterdam, un lujo la verdad. No tenemos nada malo que decir, hemos estado genial en esta casa y la comunicación ha estado muy bien con Judith. Muchísimas gracias!"
96217179,"In a single line, I can say ""You can feel like your home""."
96237651,Corina made us feel so welcome! We absolutely loved our stay and it was in a perfect location to see all the sights. It's also 2 doors down from koffiespot which is a great cafe.

96407626,"Vriendelijk ontvangen, duidelijke uitleg over de kamer, de sleutels, de locatie van de badkamer en het duidelijke, maar vriendelijke verzoek om in de ark geen schoenen te dragen. Ik kreeg bij ontvangst direct een kop thee aangeboden. Ondanks dat ik vrij laat arriveerde, nam Marga echt even de tijd voor de uitleg en een gezellig praatje."
96674743,<br/>Without doubt the apartment was a special experience and fun. Ro took care of all our requests and even more ..it was excellent. Thank you Ro!!
96685817,Vibeke was an excellent host and her flat is so lovely! She was very accommodating when we arrived (even though we were really late!) and showed us round and told us about the city. She even made us tea and gave us biscuits. The flat is really lovely - not far at all from the city centre and very comfortable. Thank you Vibeke for a fantastic stay! X
96838421,"It was a very cozy unique place, that really allows you to get a feel for Amsterdam. Lidia and JP were so helpful and welcoming. Great views of Vondel Park and public transport is right near by. Along with some cute breakfast and coffee places in walking distance. "
96936963,"WOW. we didnt expect that... <br/>It was very easy to get to Diedrik apartment. One tram from the central station and we were there. (tram 13,17) <br/>We didn't meet Diederik, but Peter his neighbor was very nice. <br/>He welcome us and gave us all the details we needed. <br/>The apartment is new. everything is as promised.<br/>The location is great, just 7 minutes walk from the Dam square.<br/>nice and quiet neighborhood with a canal view and great back door balcony. overall very modern and beautiful interior design.  <br/>we had a great time and definitely recommend this listing.<br/> "
97202696,"All very good during our stay, the flat is beautiful, typically Deutsch and 15 minutes from the center. The only thing was maybe the shower not really ""confortable"" but ok, missing mirrors for girls ;) the welcome drink was a very kind attention. We were very satisfied of our stay. "
97301678,"This bnb is in a lovely area, very accessible by tram. It is right next to Vondel Park and it provides a great atmosphere. I found myself waking up early and walking through the park, just because I could. Petra was a wonderful and helpful host who was very knowledgeable about the area. For solo and family travelers, this is definitely a place to be. "
97361853,"Our stay at Alex's place was great. He was very helpful with instructions getting there, and even offered to meet us at the station if we needed it. The place is conveniently located right near a tram station. The place was clean and beautiful with a balcony looking over a park. He generously left us a bottle of bubbly as a welcoming gift and made his private mini bar accessible to us. He provided clean bedding and linens as well as some minor toiletries. There is also a kitchen if you are looking to feed yourself there. One thing to be aware of is that the bed is a fold out couch which was not a problem for us but is something to be aware of if you sleap lightly or have issues of mobility. Overall I could not have asked for a better place to spend my weekend in Amsterdam. "
97522722,The accomodation is around 12-15 min from the city centre. It is located in quiet and green place. The place is exactly the same as in the pic. Jeroen was very helpful and waited us until late night when we arrived. Thank you for that. Overall the place is very nice.

98803190,"It was the first time we had visited Amsterdam and we have fallen in love with the city! <br/>Nima is a great host with quick replies to messages and making our check-in and check-out convenient and easy! The room was very comfortable, modern and clean! <br/>Whilst we used to Ferry once, the bus stop located right outside of the apartment was the quickest way to get into town (around 10-15mins) and the bus service was consistent and regular. <br/>During check-out we were running late but Nima understood this and helped us massively to ensure we are not rushing and leave with ease.<br/>I'd definitely recommend this apartment as it as all you need for a great trip to Amsterdam! Moreover, the friendly approach of Nima makes the trip event better!"
98829449,"Tolle Unterkunft, tolle Lage sehr zentral und schön! Sportlichkeit erwünscht wegen den vielen steilen Treppen aber das gehört wohl zum echten Amsterdam-Feeling ;).

99839038,"L'appartement de carolien est tout simplement un petit bijou dans un écrin de verdure. Dedans, dehors, votre regard sera tantôt baigné par son atmosphère délicieuse. Une fois atteint le 2e étage par son escalier typique des maisons de la capitale néerlandaise, vous découvrirez le home sweet home de Carolien qui aura disposé des fleurs fraîchement coupé pour saluer votre arrivée. Lumineux, sans vis-à-vis, l'appartement offre une vue la rive droite de l'Amstel, un véritable tableau accroché derrière les grandes baies vitrées du vaste séjour. Il vous reste à gagner le centre-ville par le métro situé à 200m ou en remontant l'Amstel... Avant de rentrer vous reposer chez Carolien dont on regretterait l'absence pour partager le vin qu'elle aura gentiment disposé sur la table de marbre."
99991896,"The place is in NDSM but we have no problem getting to the city center as it's very near to a bus station. The neighborhood is quite and serene.

100486997,Very good 
100505070,Alex was the best airbnb host that I've ever seen. He is so kind and he really thought about every single detail for the guests. House has a perfect internet connection with a nice heating/cooling unit. Air condition is nice and no smoke or food smell. Also location is really peacful and close to tram. I highly recommend his place to everybody. 
100551737,It has been a great holiday thanks to Petra and her kind and lovely  hospitality. The room is very comfortable and perfectly clean and tastefully decorated in every detail.

100776715,Marga collected me from RAI station which was a great help. The accommodation is by a House boat so is in a location of other boats on the Amstel which is a really interesting place
101009637,"Ro was phenomenally hospitable and nice to us. We arrived around midnight and he was so kind to pick us up at the Centraal statio and guide us to the apartment. <br/>He was very helpful at the end of our stay when we lost a passport. He guided us to the police office, stayed with us there when we were fixing the formalities and called a taxi for us. That was really very kind.<br/>As for the apartment, it was really cosy and looking like nothing we have seen before. Funny entry through the door in the floor :) Nice windows with a view directly on Amstel, very clean rooms. Location is super central, walking distance from literally everything in the centre of Amsterdam. We haven't used transport a single time during our stay. So overall our stay at Ro's place was an amazing experience and it was a pleasure to meet him. Really recommend to everyone who's looking for a non-standard funny cosy place in the city centre."
101507682,"Excellent emplacement, vraiment idéal pour découvrir la ville et juste rentrer dormir, à deux pas des canaux et du centre.

Merci à la belle soeur de Regina qui nous a accueillis! "

101940460,"I was only there for a night, but the host was very nice and very hands off. It didn't seem like staying in someone else's place. Allowed smoking for tourists in Amsterdam and for the price and location it was definitely worth it."
102073541,"Very nice and cosy studio. A little bit far from Rai station but once there, the center is only at 10-15min by tram. <br/>Marga and Rico received us very nicely. <br/>I recommand it ! "

102698761,"Wir waren bei Daan zu Gast eine Woche im Apartment und haben uns sehr auf die Stadt und die Wohnung gefreut, leider wurden wir sehr enttäuscht. Wir sind selber ein junges Pärchen deshalb liegt es nicht daran, dass wir einem besseren ""Standard"" gewohnt sind, aber das Apartment ist wirklich sehr dreckig! Überall häuft sich der Staub, in der Küche alles fettig und das Besteck dreckig mit Nutella Resten auf dem Messer, Haare und lauter Krümmel. In die Schubladen am besten garnicht erst reinschauen! Neben dem Bett auf dem Nachtkasten lag noch benutztes Gleitgel rum und im Bad die dreckige Wäsche von Daan. Wir waren wirklich sprachlos wie man die Wohnung fremden Leuten die dafür nicht gerade wenig zahlen, es so hinterlassen kann! Da einzige was gut war, war die Lage und die Erklärung von Daan in den E-Mails zum Check-In. Wir haben Daan natürlich deshalb sofort kontaktiert, dass es nicht sauber ist und ob wir uns auf was einigen können um es für beide Seiten recht zu machen, es kam aber nicht mehr von ihm als nach dem Motto ""wenn es euch nicht passt, dann sucht euch was anderes"" Naja, wir empfehlen es Aufjedenfall nicht weiter..

102755023,"Mustafa est un hôte de qualité, chaleureux et attentionné ! Son appartement est spacieux, propre, confortablement aménagé et équipé. Rien à redire sur notre expérience ! <br/><br/>De multiples essuies et serviettes furent préparés à notre attention, quelques aliments pour se préparer un petit déjeuner se trouvaient dans le frigo et des explications sur les transports en communs et que faire à Amsterdam reposaient sur la table. <br/><br/>L'appartement est légèrement excentré mais une ligne de tram se trouvant à 2 minutes permet de rejoindre le centre ville très facilement. La ligne est desservie fréquemment et jusque tard, permettant des escapades en soirée sans trop se soucier du retour. <br/><br/>Le logement étant non fumeur, le balcon permet de profiter pleinement de l'expérience d'Amsterdam. Gros +1. <br/><br/>"
102820329,"Diogo nous a vite accueilli et a directement présenté la ville en nous donnant une carte avec ses propres annotation. Juste parfait comme acceuil.<br/><br/>la chambre est idéalement située a 5 min du rijksmusem. l'ensemble des photos et description sont tout a fait ressemblant, pas de tricherie et un très gros plus pour la terrasse (même si nous n'avons pas pu en profiter, je ne doute pas qu'elle soit très agréable avec du beau temps) <br/><br/>La ""douche/toilette"" c'est un peu particulier (mais fidèle a la description) mais pour quelques jours rien a redire.<br/><br/>Aussi, contrairement aux photos, la télévision est maintenant a écran plat même si cela est de l'ordre du détail."
103537439,"I can't recommend this place more, Marga is an extremely caring and flexible host, and the guest house has everything you could possibly need. Cleanliness, convenience, location, etc., everything was amazing and it really gives you a feel for living like a local. I will definitely be staying here if I ever come back to Amsterdam!"
103637172,Lovely home with strategic location to walk around and explore the city. Love the big white dog too and the ambient lighting in the living room. Definitely a good recommendation to travelers who loves quiet neighborhood and warm hospitality host~
103649082,"Собрались в Амстердам спонтанно, забронировали жилье всего за несколько часов до прибытия. Все было отлично, очень общительный и гостеприимный хозяин. Помог нам с парковкой. Всем советую."

105617483,"The apartment is beautiful, just as shown on the pictures. We had a wonderful stay, which was only possible because Kutay arranged a late check-in for us in the middle of the night! <br/>Even if we never met him, he was super friendly and always reachable for any kind of question.  <br/>We definitely felt like home and can only recommend this accomodation to any one who wants to have a private, cosy (not too) little place beside all the rush of Amsterdam :) <br/>Thank you again!<br/>Last but not least I've got an advise for all of you, who are planning to go there by car: Do better not do that! <br/>Never knew that parking can be so expensive ^^ (5€/hour) <br/>"
106277684,Pim is Great host...completly disponible for us...
106530134,"Berith a été très agréable et disponible. Comme elle était souvent chez elle, elle a pris le temps de nous expliquer ce qu'il fallait voir ou ne pas voir, comment se rendre sur les lieux, les magasins aux alentours... <br/>La chambre est agréable, quelques problèmes de chauffage mais avec un bon plaid ça passe ! <br/>Petit plus : salle de bain avec douche et baignoire. <br/>Petit bémol : le wifi non disponible dans la chambre.
