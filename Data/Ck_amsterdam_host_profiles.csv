After living in Amsterdam for 22 years and having become a consultant Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, my wife Patty and I, together with our 3 young children, moved to a place closer to the sea and nature. As a base, we can still be found regularly in our cozy beach apartment in Noordwijk aan Zee. This apartment is located on the 3rd floor of a 5-floor building and has completely been renovated in 2019.

Because the balcony is quite large, with a sea view, and is conveniently located on the sun (south/west), you can enjoy everything that happens on the beach and in the sea all day long.

Due to the large parking lot at the rear of the apartment complex, you will have no problems finding a parking space and you will eventually only have to cross the boulevard to walk to the beach. There are several beach clubs situated that provide sunbed rental and nice food /drinks, so that you will be completely pampered.

The center of Noordwijk aan Zee with its many shops and restaurants is also about a 10-minute walk from the apartment.

Our main goal is to let you feel comfortable in our apartment and hope you have a wonderfull stay in Noordwijk aan Zee!

With kind regards,

Erik and Patty Salentijn-Roosen

We have a big kitchen, with dishwasher, microwave, freezer, etc.
The livingroom is big as well, we have a television, wifi, WII and a wood stove.
In the front of the ship is one (large) bedroom with a bed for two persons and in the back of the ship is also a bed for two persons, a little bit bigger than the other bed.
We have a bathroom with a bathtub and shower.
Washing machine is also available on the ship.
We have two cats. They are both lovely and will stay on the ship.

We have a natural fence of plants around the water, so it is quite safe for little kids. But we also have life vests for the little ones, which is advised.

The ship is docked and not able to sail anymore, so you don't have to be afraid of waking up in the middle of the canal ;)

Most of them designed and specially made by Collaboration-O, a group of young designers that originated from the Eindhoven Design Academy, and one by Arno Coenen and his partner IRIS.

When you wake up, you step into an art-filled, exhibition-like space instead of an anonymous lobby or hallway. The entire hotel is one big living room, with cosy seating areas between the cottages. Combined with our luxury beds and other facilities, Hotel Not Hotel offers an unrivalled experience. 
Besides all this, we feel that the value of a city lies in experiencing its local day-to-day life. As we are closely connected to Amsterdam and its numerous creative entrepreneurs, we know where to send you for a night on the town, a hidden culinary gem, or an upcoming artist’s exhibition. 

The bar connected to Hotel Not Hotel is called Kevin Bacon. Just like the actor, the bar has zero pretention, it always delivers, and it makes sure everybody has a good time.

Kevin Bacon is not your typical hotel bar. It’s where locals get their morning coffee or a quick breakfast. It’s where friends meet for a cocktail or a beer before diving into the nightlife, and where hotel guests let their hair down after a long day in the city.

When the weather is good, the ‘Whitey the White’ terrace is sunny like a perfectly fried egg. The staff’s friendly attitude shines all year round.

Born and raised in Amsterdam,  traveling the States for work for the last couple of years.

This lovely low- maintenance city is a metropole within a village; it combines the thrill and diversity of serious metropoles with the cosy and safe qualities of a village. It's the kind of city of love and it's the kind of person I am; I love the thrill and the quiet. 

I am a free lance journalist, podcaster and writer with a fascination for the human ability to adapt to the challenges of life and the the biggest challenge of all: living together, making democracy work.   Both fascinations are ever-present in the USA, so that'w where I find my stories.  

Furthermore I love cinema, basketball, cooking, dining, wine, springtime and long walks. With the ones I love, of course. In 2016, I started surfing and have taken every chance ever since to catch waves.  

I started booking with airbnb in 2011  and knowing the joy of staying in a great and homy place  decided to be part of the sharing economy all the way and share my place and knowledge of this city with like minded travelers around the world in 2014. I really do believe the sharing experience adds to the any stay, anywhere. My home is not a holiday rental - I care to share it with travelers who enjoy the sharing and local kind of travel and treat a home that same way.

I stayed here for 10 days at the end of April and was very fortunate to be blessed with great weather. My stay was excellent and the houseboat contributed a large part to that. It is located in one of the best locations of the city: next to the Jordaan and close to the Westermarkt (with Anne Frank house). It is very quiet on the water even though the city is hustling around you. Sitting outside, looking out over the water is a great experience. Weekends the canal is a bit busier with lots of small boats coming through but it create a unique atmosphere that you will not find in any of the hotels. The houseboat itself is unique so it is hard to describe, it is not small, but it does create an intimate atmosphere. I can see it would be great for a romantic stay (even though I stayed alone Lachebekje (zwart-wit)). The layout makes that the sleeping part is separated from the kitchen/living part even though there are no doors between the sections. The bed is excellent, the shower strong and hot, the kitchen fully equipped, lots of books to read and music to play. But most of the time you will be sitting outside enjoying the view of the canal and the sounds of the city. The nights and morning could be a bit chilly but heather worked just fine. I would recommend the houseboat to anyone who would like ta truly unique Amsterdam experience.

What an amazing boat and location! We spent most of our visit sitting on the back deck...and watching the symphony of the city happen around us. The bed was comfy (and I am picky), the fresh flowers were nice. We also enjoyed feeding the momma and daddy ducks with their babies. We will return and we hope the boat is available when we do.

It was really a simple button to reset that was all but I hadn't figured it out. The location is fantastic too - really I think best neighborhood in Amsterdam. What a treat to experience Amsterdam this way. I highly recommend it.

Es war alles perfekt, die Fotos geben das Boot realistisch wider, Fake war zuverlässig und sehr nett im Kontakt, der Besitzer sehr serviceorientiert und freundlich. Das Bett ist sehr komfortabel, die Ausstattung völlig ausreichend. Die Lage ist wirklich absolut zentral und alles ist fußläufig gut erreichbar. Wir könne die Unterkunft auf jeden Fall weiterempfehlen und werden wiederkommen, wenn das Boot frei ist.

AND IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH MY HOUSERULES, PLEASE, DO NOT MAKE A RESERVATION OF THE 2 ROOMS! THANK YOU.

So first a short story in english:

Hello everybody!
Introducung myself:

People call me extrovert, social and spontaneous. But the interaction with you, will also be influenced by your wishes and needs of course!
As an AIRBNB host I can prepare you tea or coffee with the dutch treat WARM SIRUP WAFELS, when you check in!
Travelling gives me a feeling of overwhelming freedom. I just love to travel around on our world with just 1 backpack. It can be challenging, interesting, exciting, squary, adventurous or horrible! I've been in more then 90 countries and my curiosity becomes bigger after every journey each year.
I also love to collect comic books, have almost 7000.
It means adventure and freedom to me.
When I read them I have the opportunity to travel around in my head.

I live in Amsterdam since 1988. At the moment in the cosey area DE PIJP.
In a beautiful apartment on floor 3 and 4, with a balcony and wonderful roofterrace, on stock 5. 

I have 2 rooms in this apartment which I rent for 3 guests. It is also possible to stay with 4 guests. But be aware: one of the  rooms is quite small for 2 guests. Check in time from 12.00 and check out time at 11.00.
These times are flexible ONLY when I do not have other guests checking in. Sometimes I have to work elsewhere. So let me know which check time you prefer. We have to sort out what the possibilities are. Some guests leave their luggage in my living room, during the check out day. Only possible if I do not need to work or have no outdoor apointments. And pick it up later.
Be aware that I'm living in this apartment, too. We do not need to share toilet and shower on floor 3. Because that is mine. You have YOUR shower and toilet on floor 4. We do need to share the use of the kitchen on floor 3. Although this was never a problem, I experienced after renting out for 3,5 years!
I am not always at home during your stay. Sometimes I need to work or have other apointments. You go your way. I will go mine.

MY HOUSE RULES:

The 2 rooms are available FROM 12.00 mostly. You need to leave the rooms at 11.00, because I need to clean them for the next guests. 

Please do not reserve the 2 rooms if you want 100 % privacy. Because I live in the apartment, too. We need to share the use of the kitchen. Where you can make yourself fresh coffee or tea. Or cook, bake or boil.

And use your own 2 fridges in your 2 rooms, please. Instead of mine.

Also be aware that the 2 rooms are very small! They do not have a lot of space to walk around.
The bathroom is comfortable.

And the 4 stairs are steep and narrow. Do not book these rooms if you have trouble climbing stairs. Not suitable if you come with heavy luggage or a baby! 

Take off your shoes before you enter my apartment. I do not want any shoes anymore in my apartment. To avoid dogshit and street dirt.

No loud noises in my house, corridor  or on the street. There are neighbours living on floor 1 and 2!

Help me to collect plastic and paper in different garbage cans in the kitchen.

Do not smoke in the apartment or in the 2 rooms.
You can smoke on the balcony or roofterrace.

No need to do any dishwashing. Just put your dirty plates or glasses etc in my dishwashing machine in the kitchen.

And enjoy your stay.

Maybe I will meet you when we travel around!
I wish you lots of inspiring journeys!
Maybe we will see each other in the future,
Kind regards, bye, adios, ciao, au revoir!                                                                         Olaf

Hallo reizigers,

Welkom op mijn profiel. Ik woon in de gezellige buurt DE PIJP, vlakbij het mooie Sarphatipark. In deze buurt hoef je je nooit te vervelen. Er zijn enorm veel verschillende soorten cafés en restaurants. De Albert Cuyp markt is elke dag open, behave zondag. Leuke winkeltjes en koffie bars in deze buurt. Voor een mooie film kan je naar Filmhuis Rialto. In het van Ostade theater worden diverse voorstellingen uitgevoerd. Een wandeling langs de Amstel aan de oostzijde is verrukkelijk. Ja, ik ben domweg gelukkig in de pijp.

Ik heb een apartement op etage 3 en 4.
En ik verhuur 2 kleine kamers op etage 4 aan 3 gasten. Dus vrijwel nooit aan 4 gasten. De 2 kamers hebben ook een eigen douche en toilet.
Ik woon zelf ook in het apartement, dus als je de 2 kamers huurt, moet je de keuken en balkon- op etage 3- en dakterras op etage 5, delen met mij. 
Check in: na 12.00 en uitchecken: om 11.00. Deze tijden zijn soms flexibel. Bijv. als er op de uitcheck dag geen andere gasten inchecken voor de 2 kamers.
Misschien tot in de toekomst.

Met warme groeten van Olaf

We are very easy going people who like festivals, concerts, movie & theater a lot. Our house is in the weekends filled with friends and/or family to have nice dinners and chilltime. Our neighbourhood is very beautifull and quiet, around the corner there is the smallest canal of Amsterdam, a beautifull old mill and also a big playground for children next to the water. The street next behind ours you'll find a small shoppingstreet with big supermarket, several (take-away) restaurants, lunch & coffeeplaces, 2 drugstores, officesupplie store, flowershop and nightshops.

Meaning Little soul, little wanderer, little charmer.

Once a traveler, always a traveler. If it isn't outbound, it's inward. And it isn't about the destination. It's about the road.  Going up and down, left and right. Sometimes welcoming with lots of comfortable hide aways. Challenging at all times. 

I prefer the word Tao. Literary meaning way, path or route. Because it clarifies the point of traveling which is to cross borders, going beyond the clearly visible, the well sign posted and known world and even beyond the world of physical appearances all together. 

Many years ago I set out traveling to expand my geographical map. I end up expanding my mind map. 

I like to share with you the place I call home. As a resting place for you on your travels through life.

Welcome in Amsterdam!

There is a lot to do in Amsterdam Noord but if you want to go to the city center, it's just a 10 minutes walk to Central Station. The ferryboat goes every 5 minutes so thats an experience by itself! If you rent a bike you can see a lot of Amsterdam. The typical Amsterdam buildings, canals, streets, the many people by bike, museums, the Dutch people and more!

Hotspots in Amsterdam Noord:
-Pllek
-De Ceuvel
-Tolhuistuin
-Eye Museum

Good restaurants in Amsterdam Noord:
-Pllek 
-Loetje aan het IJ
-Smaaqt
-De goudfazant
-Stork

Al hotspots above are within 5 a 10 minutes by bicycle from our apartment! 

Amsterdam is a busy/load city, so our apartment is the excellent choice if you want to be in the city center within 10 minutes, but also want some peace. There is not a lot noise in the street, you can park your car for free in the front of the apartment and you're in a real Amsterdam neighborhood. 

The apartment is 90 m2 and has two levels. First level has a nice living room, a kitchen with a little balcony were you can eat something. 
Upstairs you'll find the master bedroom with kingsize bed and a nice bathroom with a bath.

If you have any questions you can always email me! 

I hope to meet you and that you have a pleasant stay in Amsterdam!

In short something about myself; I work and live in Amsterdam since 2009.

It entertains me to see all the people with their own goals, planning of the day and personal expressions. In Amsterdam you never get bored with all the entertainment / shopping area’s, musea, and great terraces with the canal sceneries on the background.

In addition, the city allows me to variate on the restaurants I like to go to, to meet up with friends and relax in its surrounding nature.  As I like to exercise 3 to 4 times a week it is great  to have the Sarphati park next door and greater green areas just outside the city center.

My name is Manon and I'm living together with my boyfriend Miguel in lovely Amsterdam.

I used to live in the South of Holland but always wanted to move to Amsterdam since I was little. So during my study I moved to this great city.

I have a fulltime job in television and in my free time I love to spend time with my friends. I'm also a little addicted to traveling. The best thing you can do while traveling is connect with local people and discover the hidden gems no traveller wants to miss! That's why I rent my apartment on Airbnb.

My favorite destination?
definitely Peru

Feel welcome in Amsterdam, feel welcome in my home. And don't forget:

“If you wish to travel far and fast, travel light. Take off all your envies, jealousies, unforgiveness, selfishness“

See you soon!

My name is Morris Boermann, 34 years old and living in Amsterdam. As I am working as a management consultant with Deloitte, I get to travel from time to time. Often I would stay an extra day at my destination to get a feel for the city/country. Therefore I use AirBnB.

Each room has it's own small private bathroom, a smart tv,  coffee & tea facilities and a fridge. The 2 rooms share the front door and a small hall.

The B&B is in our family home in a nice, quiet, green neighbourhood, with excellent public transport around the corner. It is only half an hour to the city centre and all the tourist attractions are easy to reach by bus, tram or bike!

In Amsterdam it is only allowed to run a B&B when the owner lives in the house as well. So we are also living in the house with our children and our German Sheppard.

Please don't expect silence! At night it is quiet in general after 22h.

I love to meet new people from over the world and to speak foreign languages like English, Spanish, Italian and a little Portuguese, French and German.

For us, the houseboat is one big adventure! We jumped into it and we are 99% finished on how we would like to have it. However, as some of you boat lovers will know, a boat is never finished! You will always need to upgrade something or when you are less fortunate, repair something. 

BUT 99% of our stay at home we feel like we are on holiday! For example when:
- we shower in bright sunlight or underneath the stars! 
- we feed the swans from our own dining table
- we enjoy our privacy with no one being able to watch you
- we are treated with the brightest sunrise or a colorful sunset!
- we snuggle into our very very comfortable extra large box spring 
- when we jump into the water from our own boat!
- shall I go on? :)

Please share our love for water & respect our way of living: being humble and respectful towards nature and the people around you. And we welcome you to our HIDDEN GEM in Amsterdam!

Whether you are visiting Amsterdam for the first time or you have visited it before, you will always
find something new in this city full of history. Let us introduce you to this magnificent place in
another way!

We are Maria and Aurora. We met years ago in this same amazing and fabulous city, a city where
dreams come true. Here's something about us too:
I am Maria and I am an aspiring illustrator and I am also a mother. I have a Master Degree in plastic arts , fine arts and art history. After spending time abroad, I decided to stay and live in Holland. Apart from my love for art, I have always dreamed of having a small hotel where I can meet interesting people. What could be better than to be in such a fabulous and artistic city as Amsterdam! I have been away from this wonderful city and country for a short time. But it didn't take long before I came back to Amsterdam to rediscover it. Anyone who has been to Amsterdam one time, always comes back!

I am Aurora and I am a fashion branding manager and PR expert. Fashion is my passion. I have more than 15 years experience in the fashion retail industry and B2B events. I have developed several PR activities for fashion showrooms, international designers, brands, individual press shows and shows for fashion platforms. In addition to my professional love for fashion, I, as a mother, love home comfort and want to pass this love on to you and make you feel at home.

Na het huren van een eerste appartementje midden op de Wallen (Amsterdam Centrum) en de stad verder leren verkennen, vond ik ruim een jaar later ons huidige appartement in Amsterdam Oud-West. Een van de meest populaire buurten onder de Amsterdammers. Met veel plezier heb ik met andere studenten, waaronder vriendinnen, hier gewoond. Sinds 2019 woon ik samen met mijn vriend.
Sfeer, gezelligheid en warme kleuren voeren de boventoon in ons ruime appartement. Het interieur wisselend uit ikea, new design en vintage treasures zijn met veel liefde uitgezocht. De ruime eet- en woonkamer geeft je, na een lange dag door de Amsterdamse straten, het gevoel van thuiskomen. De identieke slaapkamers geven een ultiem gevoel van hotelkwaliteit. De badkamer is voorzien van toiletartikelen en uitgerust met een douche en ligbad. Samen met de luchtzuiverende planten kunt u helemaal tot rust komen. 
Voor de thuischef is de keuken van alle gemakken voorzien. Vanwege de middag- en avondzon kunt u zowel voor als achter op het ruime balkon dineren.

In my humble opinion I am very privileged to live in one of the most special places in the world: Durgerdam (Amsterdam - North).  On a historical dyke (former fisherman village), next to the IJsselmeer lake, in the typical Dutch rural landscape, but still very close to the unique city of Amsterdam.

As television producer I did (and do)  travel  a lot and I am always a fan of remarkable, unique accommodations to sleep and to stay in. Especially  excited do I get  when they are placed in the middle of nature or at unique locations.  Inspired by my visits to those spots, I decided to build my own little house, with all the comfort you need on a special place; my hometown Durgerdam/Amsterdam North.

For centuries, Amsterdam’s bridge houses accommodated the city’s many bridge keepers who were responsible for opening the impressive structures for passing water traffic. With building dates between 1673 and 2009, the bridge houses carry an extensive history. Visiting them in chronological order is like a journey through time: their various architectural styles reveal how the city developed and grew, when new quarters were built and even how people thought about city development at that time.

With the hotel room interiors, SWEETS hotel offers guests a unique and comfortable living space, while keeping the history of every bridge house in mind. All bridge houses are different, and so are the interiors. Every SWEET accommodates up to two adults and contains a kingsize double bed, a bathroom and coffee and tea facilities.

SWEETS hotel, first initiated in 2012 as an urban space project, is 8 years in the making. Over half of the 28 bridge houses are currently available for reservations, with more coming soon.

SWEETS hotel is an initiative and co-creation of the architecture office Space&Matter (known for De Ceuvel, an ecological hub), project development partner Grayfield and Suzanne Oxenaar and Otto Nan of Seven New Things, founders of Lloyd Hotel & Cultural Embassy (the world’s first 1- to 5-star hotel) and Hotel The Exchange.",2,True,24.0,97,4.77,100,100

I am a freelance writer. When I am not writing, I teach and do research at the university. When I'm not writing or working at the university, I am probably lost somewhere in one of my new journeys. My way of traveling is to get in touch with the authentic life as much as I possibly can, so I often stay with local families, in local houses, and shun the hotels all together. 

From all my journeys, the country where I would want to come back for food is Peru, for culture is India, for nature is New Zealand, for people is Yemen, and for a deep touch of love, I go to Vietnam. My dream is to be able to visit Saudi Arabia because it is the only place that does not welcome normal tourists. However, the two places where I seem to have everything right now are Sydney, and of course Amsterdam. It is a greedy combination I know. As a consequence, I often manage to live in Sydney several months each year.

A quick description of myself; family and friends (in that order) are two key aspects of my life I hold dear. For that reason I love spending time with them, especially accompanied with nice food and good wine. Aside from traveling, I love to sport (running and football mostly) and enjoy my work as a real estate developer.

Feel free to contact me should you wish to know more about me.

As a keen traveler I thought: why not let other travelers enjoy my place when I'm out on adventure. It's a great spot, I've been living here for almost 10 years, without any intention to leave the city (permanently). But...I do need my getaways. The last long one was an India-Australia journey of 5 months which ended in January 2012. This summer Paris, Barcelona and, hopefully, my lost love London will be on the menu. 

I work in education and do a whole bunch of other fun things on the side. I can't live without good food, I am a keen cook, and even did a stint being one at a local restaurant. Experimenting with veg and fish is one of my favourite things to do. A cheese sandwich just doesn't do it for me. Hanging out with friends and family for - again - dinner, or a lazy afternoon in the park with books and - yes - snacks,  make me happy too. 

For my guests I will -of course - have an extensive list of all the good food/drink places at hand, I can give you a customised advice of theatre performances and gigs, and I will also tell you about the less obvious haunts for sightseeing. These are the things I enjoy most when I travel and connect with the locals...
