Ready for a walk on the hillside? 🌳🌿<br /><br /><br />The park Buttes Chaumont, located in the north-east of Paris, is one of the largest green spaces in Paris (25 hectares) and one of the most original. Its construction on quarries explains its escarpment and its impressive elevation. Very hilly, it has great prospects for the capital, especially in the Montmartre district. Its layout, with its caves and waterfalls, its suspension bridge and its madness perched on a belvedere, gives it a special charm. It is decorated with exotic and native trees and the many birds (seagulls, water hens, mallards) share the territory and benefit from the artificial lake.

As attracted by a mystical force, he let himself be guided by these gleams until he reached the top of the mountain. It was there in front of him that a striking spectacle was revealed: that of the immensity of the horizon. With a glance taped between heaven and earth, Cliff felt a deep certainty: he had found his haven, his refuge in the heart of nature.<br /><br />Is that legend true? No!

14216718,"Großes Glueck - thatched roof, sauna Entire cottage in Tetenbüll, Germany Lovingly and with care, we have furnished our thatched cottage - in the hope that you and your family and / or friends will feel at home!<br /><br />A newly covered, local thatched roof, the restoration of the old dormer and a careful approach to the expansion in order to preserve as much as possible - that was important to us and characterizes this unique building. Unfortunately, we are not suitable for party groups!<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />We paid particular attention to the use of high-quality and partly ecological building materials. The walls are treated with CHALK TIME paints and you will find mainly natural materials - wood and concrete. And yes - we are something special - and quite deliberately! We have collected the furniture carefully for years - hoping you like it! We are not just an accommodation - we are your home away from home - books, personal things that make the apartment special and toys are available. <br />In the basement there is the 55 square meter, bright living/dining/kitchen area with concrete floor and underfloor heating in the entire basement - while you read on the large comfortable sofa, you can play at the large dining table and cook in the kitchen - each for themselves and yet all together. And when the wind whistles around the house, the fireplace is loaded. The panoramic glass pane makes the TV superfluous. <br /><br />Frozen after the long walk through the Koog - then off to the bathtub - candles on and let the rubber duck swim...Not in the mood for a bath? Then it's off to the ground-level wellness shower - also big enough for 2 <br /><br />On 2 floors there are 3 bedrooms and an alcove bed available. <br />The alcove is 140 × 200 and highly sought after by our guests!<br /><br />A bedroom with a 160 x 200 cm double bed is located downstairs. <br /><br />Two more upstairs - a double bed of 140 x 200 cm in one and 2 single beds of 90 x 200 cm, which could be pushed together if necessary. <br />We are happy to provide a crib free of charge! Just let us know. <br /><br />A 2nd, separate toilet with sink is also on the upper floor. <br /><br />In the natural garden, there is a sauna for 4-6 people overlooking the old Koog, a wooden deck and a cold outdoor shower. <br /><br />The sauna can be used by both houses - but it is exactly in the middle, so that no one has to walk past the other naked. <br /><br />Due to the absolute seclusion on a service road, you can watch stars here, take long and extended walks, unwind by the fireplace, go on bike rides through Eiderstedt or cook with your friends on the gas stove. We are located near the picture book village of Tetenbüll and look forward to giving you tips for the area.<br /><br />On our dike property there is now a fireplace - stick bread and beer by the campfire.<br /><br /><b>Guest access</b><br />The former workers' cottage is divided into a large apartment for 6 to 8 people on 2 levels with about 140 square meters, a private entrance and a large, old, natural garden with a view of the old Koog. <br />Next door, separated by sight, there is a smaller apartment for 2 to 4 people. <br /><br />Each apartment has its own private garden area and is also completely separated acoustically.<br /><br /><br />Sauna use, bed linens, towels, dish towels, tabs, toilet paper, soap, coffee filters, tea, etc. is all free of charge for you on site.<br /><br />You have the option to order a regional breakfast box on the weekend.<br /><br />www.meine-frühstücksbox.de<br /><br /><b>Other things to note</b><br />We have a very bad Internet connection - that's why we deliberately decided against Wi-Fi, as we would only get a maximum of DSL 2000 - every user with a stick can achieve better connections here.

21643560,"On Dé Pyès Kaz: double bedroom, kitchen, terrace Entire rental unit in Capesterre-Belle-Eau, Guadeloupe In a small house suspended between sky and sea on the heights of Sainte-Marie, in a green and countryside setting, On Dé Pyès Kaz is the ideal starting point for discovering the hidden treasures of Guadeloupe.<br />You will enjoy an air-conditioned bedroom, bathroom, private terrace equipped with a kitchenette and hammock for pleasant evenings. <br />Parking, independent access. Large terrace and swimming pool of the house accessible on certain time slots.<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />Guests can park their car in front of the house, and access their room and terrace completely independently.<br /><br />The room has a small outdoor kitchen, and we can provide a barbecue on request.<br />All windows in the accommodation are equipped with mosquito nets for maximum comfort. A mobile and comfortable mosquito net is also provided for the bed.<br /><br />To sleep, you can enjoy the coolness of the night thanks to the large ceiling fans (installed at the end of 2023), combined with the shutters: the heat generally drops when night arrives. It is also possible to choose air conditioning (changed mid-June 2024). Both options are quickly effective, and it only takes a few minutes for the room temperature to suit you best!<br /><br />Your terrace has a small outdoor shower, in the middle of the lush garden, which will allow you to rinse off when you return from the beach before settling in, with a book in hand in the hammock pulled between a post and the coconut tree.<br /><br />We have three domestic cats, and often cats and kittens in temporary foster care (association). In case of allergy, let us know ahead of time.<br /><br /><b>Guest access</b><br />The house has a large terrace and a swimming pool where it is nice to sunbathe while watching the sailboats pass offshore, in front of the coast of Marie-Galante. This terrace is shared with us, you can enjoy it during the day, on certain time slots (10 a.m. – 12 p.m. and 2 p.m. – 6 p.m.).<br /><br /><b>Other things to note</b><br />All windows in the accommodation are equipped with mosquito nets for maximum comfort. A comfortable, movable mosquito net is also provided for the bed. Capesterre-Belle-Eau, Basse-Terre, Guadeloupe: The house is located in a small residence where all the neighbors know each other. The area is very rural and peaceful, the main noise nuisance comes from wild chickens that wander as they please. | Getting around: You will be a 5-minute walk from the village of Sainte-Marie (bakery, post office, grocery store, grilled chicken...), and a 15-minute walk from Roseaux beach, very nice for a morning swim for example.<br />To go further, you will probably need to rent a car: there is a bus stop in the village of Sainte-Marie, but buses are rare and schedules are very unreliable. Hitchhiking used to work very well, but has become much more complicated with Covid.<br /><br />You can visit the Longueteau Distillery just a short drive from the house.<br />In less than 30 minutes' drive you will find many waterfalls and hikes (Chutes du Carbet, Bras de Fort waterfall, Bassin Bleu, hot baths, Canyon de la Moustique, Saut de la Lézarde, Rivière de la Coulisse...), as well as several beautiful beaches. The Valombreuse Garden, which offers a walk in the heart of a magnificent botanical garden, is also a must-see in the area.<br />The pier for Les Saintes is also a 30-minute drive away.<br />In 30 minutes you will also be in the heart of Pointe-à-Pitre, where you can visit the Acte Memorial Museum, taste local specialties, stroll through streets full of charm and heritage that are too often forgotten, or take the boat to Marie Galante.<br />It will take between 45 minutes and 1 hour to admire the other faces of the island: Grande Terre, its cliffs, beaches and countryside; and the Côte Sous Le Vent, its seabed, jagged coastline and sunsets.

51826799,"Classy Room 17th Century Canal House Entire rental unit in Amsterdam, Netherlands Private double room in a canal house dating from 1608 situated on Singel Canal in the oldest part of Amsterdam. Centrally located.<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />This private room available for the exclusive use of the guests is just like an apartment without a kitchen; the room is situated on the first floor at the front of the house. This Airbnb-space includes a large bedroom with exposed oak beams and an authentic brick wall. <br /><br />Bathroom:<br />Adjacent to the bedroom is your private bathroom (with shower, sink, mirror and toilet) for the guests only. Please note that there indeed is a shower in the bathroom, but no bath! In the room itself, there is a double bed consisting out of 2 latex mattresses each measuring 90 x 200 cm. Please note that the bed consists out of TWO single mattresses measuring 90 x 200 cm and not out of one double mattress measuring 180 x 200 cm. <br /><br />Heating in the room: There are two large radiators in the room located beneath all of the windows and one can adjust the temperature in the room by turning the temperature-knobs on these radiators. <br /><br />Cooling in the room: There are two fans available.<br /><br />There is also a sitting area with a couch, 2 chairs, cable television, a DVD-player, internet using Wifi as well as internet by the use of a cable. There are lots of books, mostly in the English language on various topics and a computer-desk in the study corner with a chair; a 'laptop friendly workspace' in case you need to get some work done.<br /><br />On the booking platforms this space cannot be called an apartment because the space does not include a kitchen. However, there is a coffee machine and a water kettle to make hot beverages. There is a small refrigerator for your convenience as well as cups, glasses, plates and cutlery.<br /><br />Sheets and towels are 60° Celsius cleaned.<br /><br />The surface area of the space is ± 50 m2.<br /><br />Trains, buses and metro are within 5 min. walking distance.<br /><br />My two cats 'Lucas' and 'Snout' do not enter the guest space on the first floor. This private room is cat-free.<br /><br /><b>Guest access</b><br />This private room is situated on the first floor at the front of the house and can be reached by entering the house through the main door, going up the stairs to the first floor. There is no elevator. The stairs are steep. See the photograph of the stairs in the picture-portfolio. Elderly people and people with limited ability need to be aware of this.<br /><br />If you want to travel with your child, I have one baby bed available or a small (!) child can sleep on the sofa. Please inform us in advance when you wish to bring an infant or small child with you so we can prepare the room accordingly.<br /><br />➤ Please note that it is not allowed to arrange photoshoots at this accommodation.<br />➤ Please note that this historic house has limited sound isolation<br />➤ Please note that smoking and vaping is not allowed, under no circumstances at all<br /><br /><b>Other things to note</b><br />In case of emergency you can quickly leave the room by opening the window next to the bed and decend onto the roof below. The key to this window is already in the lock attached to the window. You turn the key and the lock will open, you open the window and you descend onto the roof below. It is very easy.<br /><br />I live in the same building. My quarters are situated on the ground floor and in the basement of the house. <br />During the day I occasionally will have a violin student come for a lesson, so you may hear some violins playing in the background.<br /><br />It is important for guests to realise that this private room is situated in a house in the very centre of Amsterdam in the middle of the hustle and bustle of the old city, a house more than 400 years old. This means that the levels of sound isolation required for modern buildings cannot be met without eliminating the charm and character of a 17th. Century house. In other words: the sound-isolation in this house is not ideal. In the apartment above the guestroom the upstairs neighbours live. You may hear footsteps on the stairs and also footsteps coming form the apartment above. I do apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.<br /><br /><b>Registration Details</b><br />0363 3223 E976 5314 BBB1 Amsterdam, Noord-Holland, Netherlands: Amsterdam is one of the greatest small cities in the world.

Also note that the villa is surrounded by nature, in the jungle, which makes your holiday quiet and serene. In this regard, on the territory you can see gigantes, squirrels, monitor lizards, street cockroaches, frogs and other insects that live in Thailand.

A still preserved paradise with calm crystal clear beaches. The forest is comprised by the fauna and flora of the Green Coast region. One of the main treasures is the local community with only 200 residences, where slow living and serenity are the biggest luxury.<br />Tourists have the opportunity to interact with the community and nature through the beach, river, mangrove, hikes, walks, kayak, scubadiving, snorkelling and much more. There are restaurants and boat tours to Ilha das Couves, Ilha Comprida, Ilha dos Porcos, Carapuça, Prumirim, Almada, etc.<br />It's also the best place to stay for the ones looking for enjoying Praia da Fazenda, Praia Brava de Camburi and Almada.

240534609,"Cozy modern ""Loft"" apartment in canal district Room in aparthotel in Amsterdam, Netherlands Discover a new kind of business hotel in the heart of the canal district.<br /><br />Located within 1 mile of Amsterdam Central Station, Zoku is designed for professionals, business travelers, and remote workers who are on the lookout for a trendy & sustainable apartment hotel for 1 day, to 1 month, to 1 year.<br /><br />When you feel like leaving your private Loft to socialize, the rooftop Social Spaces are open 24/7 and cater to your fun, practical, and professional needs - all while providing amazing views!<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />PLEASE NOTE! A mandatory 12.5% city tax per room is not included in the total cost calculated on Airbnb. We can't adjust the settings in Airbnb to add this, so this will need to be paid upon your arrival. Thanks for understanding!<br /><br />Sleep, work, dine, repeat. All from your own private Zoku Loft.<br /><br />Say goodbye to traditional hotel rooms. We did 150 interviews with our target audience and made 6 different prototypes to create perfect the award-winning Zoku Loft: a micro-apartment designed for living comfortably and working efficiently. Now you can experience spacious living in less square meters: 24m2 to be exact!<br /><br />In a regular hotel room or studio apartment, the bed always dominates. In the Zoku Loft, the big kitchen table serves as the focal point, shifting the center of the space from the bed to the living room. Now you have a truly livable home to explore Amsterdam and work abroad for as long as you want<br /><br />Here's what sets our ""Loft"" apart:<br /><br />• Lofted beds: You can feel comfortable inviting friends or business relations into your home with a lofted bed that tucks away. Best rest assured, the king-size bed is still freakishly comfortable when it's time to tuck yourself in. Viva la nap!<br /><br />• Open living area: Goodbye tiny hotel room with just a ho-hum bed. The central feature of the Loft is a four-person table to work, dine, entertain, or gently rest your head. It's situated right next to the comfy couch and full living room.<br /><br />• Fully equipped kitchen: We get it, you want to cook your own meals sometimes. Enjoy the culinary power of a full kitchen in the comfort of your private home-away-from-home.<br /><br />• Personalization: A home should reflect your own personal taste, so your Loft should too. For the finishing Zoku touch, choose your favorite artwork to hang on the walls from the hallway Art Swap Station. <br /><br />• Tons of storage: You won't run out of storage space when you stay with us. That means having enough hangers, a place to store your luggage, and plenty of extra drawers and cabinets to store all your things. <br /><br />• Private space & bathroom: The entire Loft is yours only. This means you have your own private kitchen, bathroom, living room, and bedroom. Psst... the rooftop Social Spaces are the only shared areas!<br /><br />On top of this, the bathroom features floor-to-ceiling mirrors, a sliding door to separate the high-pressure shower, dimmable lighting, and a cabinet to store (and hide) your toiletries. <br /><br />So have we convinced you yet? ;)<br /><br /><b>Guest access</b><br />Zoku works in an upside-down way: our check-in and shared spaces are on the top floor, rather than on the ground floor when you walk in. This allows us to tap into natural daylight, amazing views, and a large rooftop greenhouse with outdoor terraces.<br /><br />By staying with us, you get 24/7 access to the rooftop Social Spaces which include a Living Room, Coworking Spaces, Meeting Rooms, Living Kitchen Restaurant, Kindred Spirits Bar, and Green Terraces. <br /><br />Living Room:<br /><br />Our cozy Living Room has all the comforts of home, without you ever having to vacuum it. Win-win. Kick off your shoes, grab your favorite book, and hang out in one of our cozy nooks. There are plenty of elements to inspire you – from crackling fireplaces to some cracking board games on the shelves. Feel free to get out of your comfort zone and get more comfortable. Feeling homesick? Zoku’s family of residents scattered across this room might even substitute for some of the people you miss back home. Just strike up a conversation. We try to vet everyone for friendliness.<br /><br />Coworking Spaces:<br /><br />Your new home base comes with inspiring workspaces and views. With bright, open spaces and a lively community of like-minded international professionals, our rooftop co-working spaces are ideal for anything from writing bulky reports to facilitating creative brainstorming sessions. Simply find an inspiring spot on our rooftop and flip open your laptop. Every day at 15:30, our Community Manager even hosts a “Fika” social coffee break to bring together local members and international residents. It’s a great moment to get a caffeine boost, broaden your network, and share a fun story or two.<br /><br />Meeting Rooms:<br /><br />Brainstorm, connect or hit that deadline together in our rooftop meeting rooms. From AV equipment, to office tools and whiteboards, we have it all. Be warned: the stunning views can distract. We even offer a large Event Space to host a variety of events, with access to its own private kitchenette and wardrobe too.<br /><br />Living Kitchen Restaurant:<br /><br />At Zoku, we have a strong need for simplicity. Our worldly Living Kitchen is just that: it provides simple, honest, and tasty food. And food simply tastes better when it’s shared with good company. Discover our rooftop restaurant where stories are shared across long communal tables. Open daily for breakfast, lunch, brunch, and dinner, our restaurant is available to Zoku residents as well as locals from the neighborhood.<br /><br />• Breakfast: €24 for buffet-style breakfast.<br />• Lunch: €25 for daily changing healthy buffet-style lunch.<br />• Dinner & Weekend Brunch are à la carte.<br /><br />Kindred Spirits Bar:<br /><br />Our rooftop bar has one of the best views of the city. During the day, it’s the place to go for a coffee and a quick screen break. In the evening, a more intimate mood sets in – for instance, bread, cheese, and wine might just appear to be shared with colleagues or friends. Treat yourself to a delicious G&T or tap your own beer from a local brewery. There are plenty of options for any occasion. In the summertime, the terrace often takes on a dream-like quality – guaranteed after a drink or two.<br /><br />Green Terraces:<br /><br />Experience the seasons in a highly urban environment. Zoku comes in green, both inside and out. We pride ourselves on our wide collection of potted plants. But it’s our rooftop garden that hits peak green. Ah, the views! And do note the Greenhouse and rooftop garden when you arrive, where we grow the vegetables and herbs that we use to cook from our very own kitchen.<br /><br />Rooftop Events:<br /><br />From weekend brunches, to writing workshops, to Friday Night Live Music, our regular events will connect you with inspiring individuals to exchange concepts, products and life lessons – all while having some fun!

It’s a private and clean space to have a shower, change outfits, or just do a quick make-up check. Even if your Loft isn’t quite ready yet, you will be.<br /><br />Launderette: <br /><br />Want to do some laundry? We feel you! And we certainly don’t want to smell you :) Rest assured: our full Launderette comes with an ironing board and stacks of mags, making the chore even more pleasurable. Ask a Sidekick for washing coins.<br /><br />Locker Room: <br /><br />Arriving early or still need to explore the city after check-out time? Store your luggage and any personal belongings in our Locker Room. <br /><br />Pantry: <br /><br />No skeletons in these closets! Visit the Pantry on your Loft floor for additional supplies during your stay, such as cleaning materials, fresh sheets, kitchen utensils, an extra pillow, spare wine glasses, you name it. <br /><br />(Almost) Everything Store: <br /><br />For those of you who want to grab a midnight snack or borrow a travel adapter, this is the place to visit! All items that you purchase are yours to keep. Or you can choose to simply borrow something. We trust you to return it once you’re done. We love an honor system.<br /><br />Workshop Wall: <br /><br />Need a pair of scissors or some sticky notes to brainstorm the day away? Grab what you need from our Workshop Wall and go wild. If you’re hosting a meeting for the day, you can also stop by to grab a hot beverage or a quick snack too.<br /><br />Music Corner: <br /><br />Can you tell a lente from a lentissimi arpeggio? Then this is your spot! Join Zoku’s house band, or just pull an instrument off the wall and riff away. Who knows, someone might even join you.<br /><br />Treatment Room: <br /><br />Let us help you unwind after a hard day’s work with a relaxing massage, provided by our passionate partner: The Massage Ambulance.<br /><br /><b>Other things to note</b><br />A mandatory 12.5% city tax per room is not included in the total cost calculated on Airbnb.

490926899,"Cozy modern ""Loft"" apartment in canal district Room in aparthotel in Amsterdam, Netherlands Discover a new kind of business hotel in the heart of the canal district.<br /><br />Located within 1 mile of Amsterdam Central Station, Zoku is designed for professionals, business travelers, and remote workers who are on the lookout for a trendy & sustainable apartment hotel for 1 day, to 1 month, to 1 year.<br /><br />When you feel like leaving your private Loft to socialize, the rooftop Social Spaces are open 24/7 and cater to your fun, practical, and professional needs - all while providing amazing views!<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />PLEASE NOTE! A mandatory 12.5% city tax per room is not included in the total cost calculated on Airbnb. We can't adjust the settings in Airbnb to add this, so this will need to be paid upon your arrival. Thanks for understanding!<br /><br />Sleep, work, dine, repeat. All from your own private Zoku Loft.<br /><br />Say goodbye to traditional hotel rooms. We did 150 interviews with our target audience and made 6 different prototypes to create perfect the award-winning Zoku Loft: a micro-apartment designed for living comfortably and working efficiently. Now you can experience spacious living in less square meters: 24m2 to be exact!<br /><br />In a regular hotel room or studio apartment, the bed always dominates. In the Zoku Loft, the big kitchen table serves as the focal point, shifting the center of the space from the bed to the living room. Now you have a truly livable home to explore Amsterdam and work abroad for as long as you want<br /><br />Here's what sets our ""Loft"" apart:<br /><br />• Lofted beds: You can feel comfortable inviting friends or business relations into your home with a lofted bed that tucks away. Best rest assured, the king-size bed is still freakishly comfortable when it's time to tuck yourself in. Viva la nap!<br /><br />• Open living area: Goodbye tiny hotel room with just a ho-hum bed. The central feature of the Loft is a four-person table to work, dine, entertain, or gently rest your head. It's situated right next to the comfy couch and full living room.<br /><br />• Fully equipped kitchen: We get it, you want to cook your own meals sometimes. Enjoy the culinary power of a full kitchen in the comfort of your private home-away-from-home.<br /><br />• Personalization: A home should reflect your own personal taste, so your Loft should too. For the finishing Zoku touch, choose your favorite artwork to hang on the walls from the hallway Art Swap Station. <br /><br />• Tons of storage: You won't run out of storage space when you stay with us. That means having enough hangers, a place to store your luggage, and plenty of extra drawers and cabinets to store all your things. <br /><br />• Private space & bathroom: The entire Loft is yours only. This means you have your own private kitchen, bathroom, living room, and bedroom. Psst... the rooftop Social Spaces are the only shared areas!<br /><br />On top of this, the bathroom features floor-to-ceiling mirrors, a sliding door to separate the high-pressure shower, dimmable lighting, and a cabinet to store (and hide) your toiletries. <br /><br />So have we convinced you yet? ;)<br /><br /><b>Guest access</b><br />Zoku works in an upside-down way: our check-in and shared spaces are on the top floor, rather than on the ground floor when you walk in. This allows us to tap into natural daylight, amazing views, and a large rooftop greenhouse with outdoor terraces.<br /><br />By staying with us, you get 24/7 access to the rooftop Social Spaces which include a Living Room, Coworking Spaces, Meeting Rooms, Living Kitchen Restaurant, Kindred Spirits Bar, and Green Terraces. <br /><br />Living Room:<br /><br />Our cozy Living Room has all the comforts of home, without you ever having to vacuum it. Win-win. Kick off your shoes, grab your favorite book, and hang out in one of our cozy nooks. There are plenty of elements to inspire you – from crackling fireplaces to some cracking board games on the shelves. Feel free to get out of your comfort zone and get more comfortable. Feeling homesick? Zoku’s family of residents scattered across this room might even substitute for some of the people you miss back home. Just strike up a conversation. We try to vet everyone for friendliness.<br /><br />Coworking Spaces:<br /><br />Your new home base comes with inspiring workspaces and views. With bright, open spaces and a lively community of like-minded international professionals, our rooftop co-working spaces are ideal for anything from writing bulky reports to facilitating creative brainstorming sessions. Simply find an inspiring spot on our rooftop and flip open your laptop. Every day at 15:30, our Community Manager even hosts a “Fika” social coffee break to bring together local members and international residents. It’s a great moment to get a caffeine boost, broaden your network, and share a fun story or two.<br /><br />Meeting Rooms:<br /><br />Brainstorm, connect or hit that deadline together in our rooftop meeting rooms. From AV equipment, to office tools and whiteboards, we have it all. Be warned: the stunning views can distract. We even offer a large Event Space to host a variety of events, with access to its own private kitchenette and wardrobe too.<br /><br />Living Kitchen Restaurant:<br /><br />At Zoku, we have a strong need for simplicity. Our worldly Living Kitchen is just that: it provides simple, honest, and tasty food. And food simply tastes better when it’s shared with good company. Discover our rooftop restaurant where stories are shared across long communal tables. Open daily for breakfast, lunch, brunch, and dinner, our restaurant is available to Zoku residents as well as locals from the neighborhood.<br /><br />• Breakfast: €24 for buffet-style breakfast.<br />• Lunch: €25 for daily changing healthy buffet-style lunch.<br />• Dinner & Weekend Brunch are à la carte.<br /><br />Kindred Spirits Bar:<br /><br />Our rooftop bar has one of the best views of the city. During the day, it’s the place to go for a coffee and a quick screen break. In the evening, a more intimate mood sets in – for instance, bread, cheese, and wine might just appear to be shared with colleagues or friends. Treat yourself to a delicious G&T or tap your own beer from a local brewery. There are plenty of options for any occasion. In the summertime, the terrace often takes on a dream-like quality – guaranteed after a drink or two.<br /><br />Green Terraces:<br /><br />Experience the seasons in a highly urban environment. Zoku comes in green, both inside and out. We pride ourselves on our wide collection of potted plants. But it’s our rooftop garden that hits peak green. Ah, the views! And do note the Greenhouse and rooftop garden when you arrive, where we grow the vegetables and herbs that we use to cook from our very own kitchen.<br /><br />Rooftop Events:<br /><br />From weekend brunches, to writing workshops, to Friday Night Live Music, our regular events will connect you with inspiring individuals to exchange concepts, products and life lessons – all while having some fun! Check out the latest events happening during your stay on our website or @zokuamsterdam social media account.<br /><br />On top of this, there are plenty of other useful spaces located throughout Zoku that anyone who stays with us can use!<br /><br />Changing Room: <br /><br />For freshening up before hitting the town or washing away your travels, you can use our Changing Room. It’s a private and clean space to have a shower, change outfits, or just do a quick make-up check. Even if your Loft isn’t quite ready yet, you will be.<br /><br />Launderette: <br /><br />Want to do some laundry? We feel you! And we certainly don’t want to smell you :) Rest assured: our full Launderette comes with an ironing board and stacks of mags, making the chore even more pleasurable. Ask a Sidekick for washing coins.<br /><br />Locker Room: <br /><br />Arriving early or still need to explore the city after check-out time? Store your luggage and any personal belongings in our Locker Room. <br /><br />Pantry: <br /><br />No skeletons in these closets! Visit the Pantry on your Loft floor for additional supplies during your stay, such as cleaning materials, fresh sheets, kitchen utensils, an extra pillow, spare wine glasses, you name it. <br /><br />(Almost) Everything Store: <br /><br />For those of you who want to grab a midnight snack or borrow a travel adapter, this is the place to visit! All items that you purchase are yours to keep. Or you can choose to simply borrow something. We trust you to return it once you’re done. We love an honor system.<br /><br />Workshop Wall: <br /><br />Need a pair of scissors or some sticky notes to brainstorm the day away? Grab what you need from our Workshop Wall and go wild. If you’re hosting a meeting for the day, you can also stop by to grab a hot beverage or a quick snack too.<br /><br />Music Corner: <br /><br />Can you tell a lente from a lentissimi arpeggio? Then this is your spot! Join Zoku’s house band, or just pull an instrument off the wall and riff away. Who knows, someone might even join you.<br /><br />Treatment Room: <br /><br />Let us help you unwind after a hard day’s work with a relaxing massage, provided by our passionate partner: The Massage Ambulance.<br /><br /><b>Other things to note</b><br />A mandatory 12.5% city tax per room is not included in the total cost calculated on Airbnb.
